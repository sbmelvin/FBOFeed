<DESC>THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THIS BAA SOLICITATION.  This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the ElectromagneticsTechnology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RYH), set forth under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Awards for proposals submitted in response to this BAA are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  For purposes of this announcement, basic research (6.1) is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge and understanding related to long term national security needs rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  It provides part of the base for subsequent exploratory (6.2) and advanced (6.3) developments in defense related technologies.  Under this BAA 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 proposals are solicited. This BAA shall remain open for a period of!  two calendar years from the initial date of publication.
	AFRL/RYH contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and  industry for electromagnetics research.  This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all technical areas of interest to the Division.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to the Electromagnetics Technology Division are encouraged to not only carefully peruse this BAA, but to contact the appropriate point of contact identified in this publication as well, to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/RYH may have in specific research projects.
	The program is organized by scientific discipline, and the reader may note some overlap between sections.  The research areas described could have short or long-range impact on Air Force capabilities.  Typical research programs sponsored by AFRL/RYH vary in length from 6 to 36 months and require from 0.5 to 10 total man-years to complete, but these should not be construed as rigid requirements. If progress in certain areas requires several investigators, and especially if an interdisciplinary approach is necessary, AFRL/RYH will consider proposals for more comprehensive research programs.  Only a small number of such large programs may be initiated in a single fiscal year.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB (NCHHSTP), Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source award for the purchase of 24 male rhesus macaques with the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, Caribbean Primate Research Center.  The purpose of the longitudinal study is to 1) evaluate the immunogenicity in animals of non-replicating multi-clade and single clade consensus HIV-1 envelope virus-like particle vaccines, 2) determine whether transmission of repetitive intra-rectal challenges of pathogenic SHIV-C can be prevented in immunized macaques, and 3) evaluate immunized animals before, during and after repeated mucosally administered virus challenges.  Specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks in this project:   

 Task 1:  Identify 24 male rhesus macaques for the project longitudinal study.

Task 2:  Administer vaccine formulations at four time points according to the schedule.

Task 3:  Administer weekly intra-rectal virus challenges to the rhesus macaques.

Task 4:  Collect and monitor blood samples from male rhesus macaques, following the appropriate bleeding schedule, for a total of 12 months per phase.  Blood samples shall be monitored for the following:




	Frequency and absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

	Hematologic chemistry and CBC, at described frequencies 

       Task 5:  Isolate and Freeze PBMC from blood samples. 

       Task 6:  Collect rectal and broncho-alveolar washes following the appropriate schedule.  

 Task 7:  Monitor animal health for symptoms of adverse reactions, as characterized by hemogram abnormalities, cachexia, loss of CD4+ T cells, etc.  These animals shall be monitored for 12 months unless they develop severe adverse reactions as described resulting in loss of body weight of 25 percent for two consecutive months.  If that occurs, the macaques shall be euthanized.

Task 8:  At the bleeding schedule provided, collect, process, package and ship requested blood specimens for overnight delivery to CDC, for in vitro virologic & immunologic evaluations.  Specimens are to be shipped in accordance with IATA regulations at website: (http://www.iata.org/index.htm).   
 
The anticipated period of performance will be 24 months from the award date.  The University of Puerto Rico is the only source to provide the specific quantity, type, weight, gender, and critical timeframe deemed necessary by CDC.  Hence, a contract with the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, Caribbean Primate Research Center would be the most efficient and cost effective way to deliver services that are critical and essential to meet CDC’s requirement. CDC intends to negotiate this requirement with the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, Caribbean Primate Research Center under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, HHSAR 306.302-1, and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).  Any other responsible sources may submit a statement of qualifications and experience which, if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.  Inquiries must be received on February 23, 2009, at 10 AM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Responses may be E-mailed to Betty Vannoy at bbv9@cdc.gov.  Questions concerning this proposed acquisition may be directed to Betty Vannoy, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Themis Computer Incorporated, 3185 Laurelview Court, Fremont, CA 94538 for the acquisition of three (3) RES-32DCX Rugged Enterprise Servers (PN: 535-L1J262811-5AW0000) to support fleet repair parts.  The servers will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Themis Computer Incorporated is the sole manufacturer of these servers.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure spares in support of the Naval inventory control point in order to support fleet!  failures; so, time is an issue.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the servers are acquired from Themis Computers.
The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N61331-09-T-9506.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures is the method of award for this procurement.  The NAICS code is 33411 with size standard of 1,000 employees.  The order shall be firm fixed priced with an expected delivery date on or around 1 Apr 2009.  The expected award date will be on or around 13 Feb 09.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.  
In order to be eligible for award firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Vendors may obtain information on registration in the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Please note that defense payment office may not make payment unless the contractor is established to receive electronic funds transfer (EFT).  EFT payments are based on the contractor's EFT information contained in the CCR database.  The NSWCPC has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The proposed acquisition listed herein is exclusively set-aside as a Service–Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business requirement. The NAICS code is 541611 with a size standard of $6.5M million.  The DHHS/AOS/PSC Division of Acquisition Management plans to issue a request for proposal (RFP).  In order to mitigate risks resulting from an increase in cyber threats and to comply with federal legislation, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed an enterprise-wide information security and privacy program.  This enterprise-wide information security and privacy program is known as the Secure One HHS Program and is a collaborative effort involving all Operating Divisions (OPDIVs) and Staff Divisions (STAFFDIVs) of the HHS.  The primary purpose of the Secure One HHS Program support contract is to provide onsite support to the HHS Department Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in performing the roles and responsibilities associated with the HHS Department Senior Agency Information Security Officer, as specified in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).  FISMA requires the Department CISO to perform management and oversight of the Department’s Information Technology (IT) Security Program.  The mission of the Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO) is to provide information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information collected or maintained by or on behalf of the HHS and information systems used or operated by the HHS or HHS contractors or other organizations on behalf of the HHS. The anticipated period of performance is a basic period of one (1) year with four (4) (12 month) option periods.  The solicitation will be issued approximately fifteen (15) days after issuance of this synopsis and will be made available electronically at this address http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Only electronic copies of the solicitation will be made available.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center intends to issue a five-year, Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for repair/overhaul of TD-1473/TSC Enhanced Tactical Satellite Signal Processors (ETSSPs): National Stock Number 7025-01-516-6529 to General Dynamics SATCOM Technologies, Inc.  The ETSSP is a modified commercial signal processing multiplexer that is used in AN/TSC-85D and AN/TSC-93D Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Terminals.  These tactical communications terminals operate in the Super High Frequency band and provide reliable multichannel capacity with an anti-jam capability that provides critical communications links between deployed units and higher headquarters in support of Outside the Continental United States operations.  Currently, AN/TSC-85D and AN/TSC-93D SATCOM Terminals are being used in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the Global War on Terror.  The proposed contract is necessary to maintain seamless repair/overhaul capabilities for the ETSSP.  Without operational ETSSPs, AN/TSC-85D and AN/TSC-93D SATCOM Terminals will become inoperable.  The AN/TSC-85D and AN/TSC-93D SATCOM Terminals need to be maintained through 2018, at which time they will be replaced by the High Capacity Communications Capability Program.

<CONTACT>Phyllis A Targett, Clinical Analyst, Phone 937-257-9075, Email phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>A. General Information<br />The Heartland Region seeks to initiate a standardization process for Elastic Bandage Wraps under the Regional Standardization Program. The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region, based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. The seven facilities in the region include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox, Kentucky, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Naval Hospital Corps School Great Lakes Illinois, and USCG Air Station Traverse City, Michigan. Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative.
<p>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFQ). Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, will be disqualified in Phase I. This product line includes but is not limited to the following Elastic Bandage Wraps: ELASTIC BANDAGE ,MATRIX, 4X5YD, ELASTIC BANDAGE, MATRIX,6X5YD, MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL, PRM 3IN ELASTIC BANDAGE, KNIT W/2" DOUBLE VELCRO CLOSURE 6"X 5.5 YARD LATEX-FREE, TENSOR ELASTIC BANDAGE, W/REMOVABLE CLIP, 4", MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL STD 4IN, TENSOR ELASTIC BANDAGE, W/REMOVABLE CLIP, 6", TENSOR ELASTIC BANDAGE, W/REMOVABLE CLIP, 3", MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL STD 3IN, LATX FREE X-TEN ELAS COMPR BANDAGE NON-STERILE W/DBL SELF CLOSURE 4"X 210" STRETCHD, BEIGE. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes/applications listed.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Regions current PV Owens &amp; Minor. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement to the PV Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is July 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<br />Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>B. Products and Performance Required<br />The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Elastic Bandage Wraps, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $66,723.06. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top-ten (10) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. At the request of the Heartland Regional MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their "intent to participate" to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:<br />1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Elastic Bandage Wraps products for single use. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: ELASTIC BANDAGE ,MATRIX, 4X5YD, ELASTIC BANDAGE,MATRIX,6X5YD, MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL, PRM 3IN ELASTIC BANDAGE, KNIT W/2" DOUBLE VELCRO CLOSURE 6"X 5.5 YARD LATEX-FREE, TENSOR ELASTIC BANDAGE, W/REMOVABLE CLIP, 4", MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL STD 4IN, TENSOR ELASTIC BANDAGE, W/REMOVABLE CLIP, 6", TENSOR ELASTIC BANDAGE, W/REMOVABLE CLIP, 3", MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL STD 3IN, LATX FREE X-TEN ELAS COMPR BANDAGE NON-STERILE W/DBL SELF CLOSURE 4"X 210" STRETCHD, BEIGE <br />2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes (some of the sizes above within each product line may be similar or not applicable due to the item being available as a universal (one size fits all) category) and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Elastic Bandages Wraps product line including Latex Free with Velcro Closure, Sterile and Unsterile. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified). <br />4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Heartland Region, Owens &amp; Minor, for distribution in the Heartland Region. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<br />5. Vendors must provide their 4-Digit Prime Vendor Number in response to this RFQ. If unknown, contact Owens and Minor.<br />6. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendors MUST provide latex free Elastic Bandage Wraps. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<br />8. Vendors MUST provide Velcro closure Elastic Bandage Wraps. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of Velcro closure Elastic Bandage Wraps supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal<br />9. Vendors MUST provide Unsterile and Sterile Elastic Bandage Wraps. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of Unsterile and Sterile Elastic Bandage Wraps supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.</p>
<p>Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient-care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.50 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors' average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors' average scores). In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold. Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />1. Patient Safety-Product unrolls evenly and lies flat upon application. (Maintain even layers of woven materials, avoiding clumping, creasing or bunching of layers, which would put unequal compression on the patient).<br />a) The wrap woven material will not clump, crease or bunch together during the application.<br />b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product. <br />c) The evaluators will apply the bandage wrap on each other, rolling the wraps in the acceptable circular application. The expectation is that the woven material will not clump, crease or bunch together and cause uneven compression and pain to the patient.<br />2. Patient Safety- Product maintains therapeutic elasticity throughout a reapplication - removal of bandage wrap and rewrapping the same bandage wrap. (Loss of elasticity will require a tighter rewrapping and uneven therapeutic compression).<br />a) The bandage wrap will retain elasticity (elastic memory) when the bandage wrap is removed and reapplied.<br />b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product. <br />c) The expectation is that the bandage wrap will retain therapeutic elastic memory and provide therapeutic equal compression.<br />3. Patient Safety and maintenance of therapeutic application for the patient- The Velcro closure adheres securely and evenly. (Secure and evenly attached closure is critical to the bandage wrap remaining in place).<br />a) The Velcro closure will adhere to the woven material securely and evenly. No gaps between the Velcro and the woven material.<br />b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product.<br />c) The expectation is that the Velcro closure will adhere securely and evenly against the woven material, eliminating the possibility that the bandage wrap will become loose or fall off; thereby, loosing the therapeutic effects of the product. <br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) to include analysis to determine cost savings, if any, relative to historical spending.<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?); and<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

<DESC><p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Information<br /><br />The Southwest Region will be standardizing Sutures.&nbsp; This is a 5-year re-evaluation of this product group.&nbsp; A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.&nbsp; In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs&rsquo; needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. This product line includes absorbable and non-absorbable suture for closure and general use, dental, oral surgery, gastrointestinal, vascular/cardiovascular, subcuticular and skin closure, urology, obstetric, ophthalmic, microsurgery, endoscopic, orthopedic graft prep, neurology and plastics in individual packages, dispensing reels and precut configurations for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire category of Sutures has an annual demand of over $543,000.<br /><br />The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.&nbsp; It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving Southwest Region.<br /><br />The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit&rsquo;s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.&nbsp; The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<br /><br />The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.&nbsp; In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.&nbsp; This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.&nbsp; For additional information regarding DSCP&rsquo;s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:&nbsp; https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<br /><br />The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.&nbsp; The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.&nbsp; Anticipated award date is April 2009.&nbsp; The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.&nbsp; The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.&nbsp; As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.&nbsp;&nbsp; The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.&nbsp; The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.&nbsp; However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.&nbsp; In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.&nbsp; <br /><br />Point of Contact:<br />Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN at (619) 532-8517; Email- cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil<br /><br />B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Products &amp; Performance Required<br /><br />The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Sutures. This product line includes absorbable and non-absorbable suture for closure and general use, dental, oral surgery, gastrointestinal, vascular/cardiovascular, subcuticular and skin closure, urology, obstetric, ophthalmic, microsurgery, endoscopic, orthopedic graft prep, neurology and plastics in individual packages, dispensing reels and precut configurations for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $543,000.&nbsp; This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<br /><br />C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions to Vendors<br /><br />If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, (3) your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than February 27, 2009.&nbsp; Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM PST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.&nbsp; Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.&nbsp; If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:<br /><br />Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN <br />Tri-Service Regional Business Office <br />MSMMO - Southwest Region <br />34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 <br />San Diego, CA&nbsp; 92134 <br />Phone:&nbsp; (619) 532-8517<br /><br />This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.&nbsp; Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.&nbsp; All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.&nbsp; We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.<br /><br />D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation Criteria<br /><br />Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.<br />Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.&nbsp; The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.&nbsp; All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<br /><br />The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.&nbsp; Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:&nbsp; (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor&rsquo;s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor&rsquo;s information provided is factually correct.&nbsp; Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<br /><br />Technical/Company Criteria <br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of sutures.&nbsp; At a minimum, the line must include absorbable and non-absorbable suture for closure and general use, dental, oral surgery, gastrointestinal, vascular/cardiovascular, subcuticular and skin closure, urology, obstetric, ophthalmic, microsurgery, endoscopic, orthopedic graft prep, neurology and plastics in individual packages, dispensing reels and precut configurations for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendor must provide the brand(s) under which vendor manufactures or distributes the products.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendor must provide the size, shape, length and type of needle; the type of material, construction of material, color, strength retention and absorption profile of the material and how the sizes and expiration dates are identified on the box and individual package.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendor&rsquo;s sutures must be FDA approved. Vendor must provide documentation stating that they meet the standards.<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the increasing number of latex sensitive beneficiaries in our health system, our region requires latex-free versions of products in this product line where available.&nbsp; Additionally, products must be clearly labeled as latex free.<br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendors must provide suture in packaging that is color-coded and labeled so that suture type and length, number and type of needles, CR or MS, expiration date and reorder number be easily identified.<br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendors must provide suture packaging that makes counting and retrieval of suture easy and safe for the user from needlestick injuries.<br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendors must provide suture boxes that can be stacked for easy retrieval of individual suture packages without having to remove the entire box from the shelf.<br />9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendor products must be available through the Prime Vendor, Cardinal Health or you will be disqualified from the standardization process.&nbsp; Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<br />10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendor must have a DAPA number for this product line or you will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must provide the DAPA number for this product line.<br />11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vendor must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.&nbsp; Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to Vendor must provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.

Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.&nbsp; Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.&nbsp; Samples with literature must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.&nbsp;&nbsp; The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.&nbsp; All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the &ldquo;break&rdquo;, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.<br /><br />A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.<br /><br />Clinical/Performance Criteria<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suture packaging allows for simple and quick identification of the type and size of suture and allows for easy aseptic delivery to the sterile field.<br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinicians require packaging that allows for simple and quick identification of the type and size of suture and allows for delivery to the sterile field.<br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluator will read the package label to assess if the type and size of suture can be easily identified and then open the package and simulate aseptic delivery to a sterile field to verify the packaging allows for it easily.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expiration date is easily visible on the suture package.<br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinicians require the expiration date be easily visible on the suture package to insure expired product is not used on patients.<br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluator will inspect the suture package and verify the expiration date is clearly printed on it.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suture has uniform tensile strength and glides through the tissue.<br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinicians require that the suture have uniform tensile strength.<br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluator will use suture and evaluate the ease in which it glides through tissue and the uniformity of its strength.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suture handles well by staying securely in place and knots easily.<br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinicians require that the suture handle well by staying securely in place and knots easily. <br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluator will use suture and evaluate how it handles when removed from the package, placed through tissue and knotted.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The needle is resistant to bending or breaking while being loaded to the needle holding and while being pushed and pulled through tissue.<br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinicians require that suture needle resist bending or breaking to prevent needlestick injury to the user and patient. <br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluator will load needle to needle holder and push, pull needle through tissue, and assess the needle for bending or breaking.<br /><br />Phase III &ndash; Pricing Analysis Process.&nbsp; All vendors who provide samples with literature for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.&nbsp; The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.&nbsp; Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.&nbsp; Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).&nbsp; Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).&nbsp; The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:&nbsp; (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.&nbsp; The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.&nbsp; Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the evaluation results become more technically equal, price may become more important.&nbsp; Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).&nbsp; Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.</p>

<DESC>1.  BACKGROUND:

The mission of CBP is to secure U.S. ports of entry and borders from people and goods that are prohibited or which threaten U.S. citizens, infrastructure, resources and food supply, while efficiently facilitating legitimate trade and travel.  The mission includes interdicting contraband [i.e., drugs, currency, guns, high explosives (HE) and weapons of mass destruction (WMD)], undocumented aliens and persons deemed to be a threat to the security of the USA.  Recently, the Office of Field Operations (OFO) of CBP has identified a requirement for recording and monitoring in real-time the pursuit of drivers in vehicles, which enter the USA through a port of entry and are attempting to flee from the Customs Officers during the course of a secondary examination (the so-called “port runners”).  

2.  OBJECTIVE:  
 
The major objectives of this effort are to:
a.  Provide a reliable “in-car video camera” system, which will record and transmit in real-time (via wireless streaming video) the vehicle pursuit.
b.  Provide wireless video transmission capability over a radius of at least 100 miles.
c.  Provide a reliable “in-car video camera” system, which will record in real-time the occupants in the back seat of the CBP vehicles during transport.
d.  Provide ability to store the video file for later review and use. 
e.  Provide low-light video display and recording capability. 
f.   Provide a system which is efficient and user-friendly.
g.  Provide an integrated GPS capability to track the CBP vehicle. 
h.  Provide a system with safeguards to account for the chain of custody, while in Customs Officer’s possession.

3.  DESCRIPTION:

This notice solicits information regarding commercially available or near commercially available (i.e., full-scale, operational prototype) In-Car Video Camera Systems to determine the vendor interest in participating in an evaluation of these technologies by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).   The primary purpose of the technology is to display and record the video during pursuit, simultaneously (in real-time) transmit the video (via wireless streaming video) to a central facility, and archive the video file (record) for later review and use. 

4. SCOPE:

The announcement solicits market information for In-Car Video Camera Systems as described above.   CBP is interested in studying and evaluating the current state-of-the-art in these systems that are available without the need for further development.   This RFI seeks information on such products.

5. INFORMATION:

The evaluation process employed by CBP will consist of a review of vendor submittals by a panel of in-house subject matter experts.
      
This review is intended to demonstrate to CBP that the proposed technology satisfies the basic functional requirements and is, at a minimum, at a field deployable prototype stage.   At a minimum, vendor submittals shall include:

a. Description of the system including technical specifications.
b. Reports of vendor performed factory tests for compliance with vendor stated technical specifications.
c.  Training requirements. 
d.  System setup requirements.
e.  Warranty information.
f.  Life-time cycle costs, including cost of the system, maintenance and    training costs.  (Assume ten years for the life-time cycle.)  
g.  GSA Federal Supply Schedule Contract availability.   

Maximum size of the submittal is twenty (20) pages, including the cover letter. Please address each of the objectives listed in Section 2 above.  CBP may request further information following a vendor’s submittal.   All documents are to be provided in MS Word format using Times New Roman font at 12 point.     All packages submitted, electronically or by electronic media, must be free of any computer virus.     If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed.     Please submit a cover letter on company letterhead that includes in addition to the company name and address, the business and technical point-of-contact (POC) information [name of POC, e-mail, fax, telephone, and web page (if applicable)].     The cover letter should include a synopsis stating the concept and a brief description of the system.     The cover letter should be limited to no more than two (2) pages.

6. NOTICE:

This announcement will be open for thirty (30) days from the date of publication.  This notice is issued solely for obtaining market information and planning purposes.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  This is a Request for Information, and a vendor’s response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.  This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying whether currently available In-Car Video Camera Systems are reliable and user-friendly enough to meet the needs of Customs and Border Protection (CBP).     Vendors shall indicate their FSS contract number, business size, 8(a) or Hubzone status if applicable, and also provide their DUNS number and TAX ID number.     Any questions concerning this RFI or its accompanying document(s) must be submitted via e-mail to the Point of Contact, Dr. Siraj M. Khan CHP.

<CONTACT>Sharon Hess at 850-234-4413 , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement, a market survey for written information only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.
Background - The LCAC Alarm and Monitor System (AMS) is a legacy Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) C4N system responsible for monitoring and reporting all LCAC engineering system status. This engineering data is recorded on a ruggedized hard drive (RHD) by AMS via a SCSI-1 interface, similar to the functionality of an aircraft black box. Post-mission analysis of the recorded engineering data is accomplished on a specially outfitted computer, called a LCAC Mission Support Station (LMSS), with the LCAC Performance Analysis System (LPAS) application. In addition to interfacing with the RHD, LPAS is designed to parse and replay engineering data captured on a LCAC Common Data Recorder (CDR). The CDR is the latest evolution of the LCAC data storage system which organizes data in a more refined, New Technology File System (NTFS) file-based manner on an Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) hard disk. Over time the reliability of the Ruggedized Hard Drive (RHD) has greatly declined due ! to RHD hard disk failures. The current hard disk technology used by the RHD reached its end of life more than seven (7) years ago and the present LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) lifecycle schedule does not eliminate the need for the RHD until FY20. To further compound the problem, the LCAC Alarm and Monitoring System (AMS) interface that interacts with the RHD cannot be revised and must be accepted. Thus, a precise course of action to mitigate these failures must be defined if the RHD is to remain operational until FY20. 
Need - The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) is seeking information on vendors with the capability to develop a solution to bridge the existing AMS SCSI-1 interface to a modern IDE hard disk and/or a solid-state memory device. Any proposed solution must conform to the physical space limitations of the RHD frame and use the existing AMS communications scheme, including read/write timing constraints and hard disk capacity/sector analysis. At a minimum, data generated from the LCAC AMS would be recorded to the replacement RHD such that the data on the replacement RHD can interface with the current LMSS configurations and be accessed by LPAS without altering the LPAS source code. While this threshold requirement satisfies the need for an immediate solution, it provides little in terms of long-term supportability and a reduction in LCAC interface schemes. An objective beyond this threshold is for the replacement RHD to translate data on the fly into CDR!  format as defined in CDR-IRS-102, Revision V, and employ a solid state memory device, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash memory drive, which would readily interface to the LMSS. This solution consolidates the LCAC post-mission processing interface scheme, nearly eliminates storage media faults due to extreme vibration, provides a generic and portable media that can be read be all modern computers, and can be cheaply upgraded and replaced as needed. Any proposed solution would use power from the LCAC 28VDC  (volts direct current)distribution system, which is 18-32VDC or from the recording computer which operates the SCSCI bus controller and provides limited power in the form of 5 VDC, 1Amp and 12 VDC, 1 Amp. The latter is the legacy power source that operates the existing RHD
This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) research and development efforts planned for fiscal years 2009-2010. Components could be acquired in the future for Test and Evaluation for future LCAC ISEA installation. Both off-the-shelf and developmental approaches will be considered. Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the proposed solution with enough information for the government to make informed decisions. Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential offeror. Data with restrictive markings will be handled in accordance with the restrictions thereto. Interested parties must provide paper submittals with copies on disks in MS Word or Adobe Acrobat format. The Government will evaluate the submittals for their potential to improve the reliability of the LCAC C4N suite and reduc! e operating costs. Organizations that submit materials/designs, which are determined by the evaluation team as possessing significant potential for contributing to the improvement of LCAC maintenance may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their solution. Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Ivan Velazquez-Padilla at (850) 235-5833 (email ivan.velazquez-padil@navy.mil). Mailing address for submissions is: Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City Division, Code E31, ATTN: Mr. Ivan Velazquez-Padilla, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. Responses to this sources sought should be sent to the address stated above not later than 31 March 2009. NAICS 334112 applies. FSC 5963. Size standard 500 employees.
This is not a solicitation.  In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published in the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) and Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Prospective Move of Current Alternate Data Center (ADC) to a New Facility

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains a high-availability data delivery model for its information systems that provides simultaneous access to distributed information content. To this end, the SEC requires a secure high availability Alternate Data Center (ADC) facility located within the greater Washington DC metropolitan area. The contract for its current facility expires in March 2010. The SEC needs to evaluate the options of retaining the existing ADC in Ashburn, VA or relocating it to another data center yet to be identified. If the SEC decides to move the ADC, the contractor will need to move the SEC’s computing equipment, which the SEC operates remotely, into the new collocated hosting facility with a minimum amount of down time due to the move. It is of primary importance that the operations of EDGAR, an electronic filing system used by the SEC to manage publicly traded corporations, remain unaffected by the move. The technical solution at the new collocated hosting facility shall preserve the infrastructure architecture including the data replication architecture of the current ADC.
The SEC seeks information about a turnkey solution to 1) assess the SEC’s current Alternate Data Center (ADC) and develop a preliminary move plan to facilitate a successful migration of the ADC from the current facility to a new collocated hosting facility that provides telecommunication services from vendors on the GSA Networx and WITS 3 contracts; 2) provide the new collocated hosting facility; and 3) plan and implement the move of the SEC ADC from its current location to the new collocated hosting facility. 

NOTE:  This announcement is a Request for Information, not a solicitation.  The SEC is issuing this RFI to gather information on the capabilities of industry and price estimates for the work outlined in the attached Draft Requirements document.  If you are interested in providing information, please review the attachments and send all info. to Jeremy Garrett.  You may include price range estimates.  The SEC will consider all responses to this RFI as information only, not offers.  All information must be sent via email to GarrettJ@sec.gov by no later than 1:00 EST on February 17, 2009.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only seeking responses from Small Businesses.  Large and Non Profit Businesses are not to respond.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to this 541690 NAICS Code. Teaming is encouraged. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only. The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years. After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time. Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the questions listed below.  In addition, please provide a capability statement addressing your organization’s ability to perform as a prime contractor the work described below.

The mission of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is to bring effective substance abuse and mental health programs to every community.  SAMHSA carries out this mission by compiling prevention, treatment and rehabilitation knowledge, identifying and promoting science-based programs, and building capacity at the State and regional levels to infuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation knowledge and programs into every community in the United States.

The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment’s (CSAT) grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts are designed to develop knowledge on best practices in substance abuse treatment.  In 1999, CSAT implemented a systematic program to synthesize, publish, and disseminate this knowledge to the substance abuse (SA) treatment and related fields through the Knowledge Application Program (KAP).  KAP has been responsible for production of CSAT’s premiere publication series, Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs). The current KAP has also been charged with considering the most effective formats for presenting TIPs to each of its intended audiences, and determining whether the specialized knowledge contained in the TIPs is actually reaching and being adopted by those most in need of that knowledge.  

The current KAP contract has begun to address the need for SA treatment knowledge to be synthesized and packaged in different ways depending on the target audience.  For example, new formats known as “collateral products” have been developed to supplement the standard TIP document in order to better meet the needs of some audiences. The existing KAP program was built on the following premises: 1) Treatment information needs to be presented to target audiences through a range of media and learning approaches including interactive workshops, Internet training courses and videos, as well as the traditional training classes and written publications; and 2) To be most useful, information must be specifically tailored to the particular needs of specialized provider groups and must also be culturally relevant when appropriate.

KAP must support the strong emphasis at SAMHSA on the Science to Services and Workforce Development initiatives.  KAP will continue to address a number of diverse knowledge application activities in a cost effective and coordinated manner.  These activities will include publishing, communicating, and disseminating products to enhance quality of treatment services.  Successful implementation of the science to services cycle requires a strong monitoring and feedback component. Within the context of this requirement, offerors should demonstrate how they will promote SAMHSA's focus on disseminating effective interventions rather than generating new ones, support performance monitoring systems, assess impact of fidelity vs. adaptation on outcomes of treatment provider use of both KAP and non-KAP products, and provide input to the scientific community regarding new research priorities and service gaps for the substance abuse treatment field. Offerors shall also discuss their vision for the role of KAP in building a national dissemination network that links together existing training and technical assistance programs, and how KAP can generally support communities and providers to identify, implement, use, and evaluate best practices.

Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger). A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted.  Responses are due on February 20, 2009. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four one year option periods. After review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and formal solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.

Only Small Businesses need to respond to this sources sought.  Response to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions:

9.	Provide a proven track record of organizational capability to quickly assemble groups of seminal experts on highly specialized clinical, administrative, and fiscal matters to analyze and resolve emerging issues without hesitation; and to evaluate and immediately revise products, programs, and services (and their approaches) for expanded and alternative uses in the substance abuse treatment field.
10.	Demonstrate experience managing a major national initiative and implementing complex guidance from Federal staff, with a minimum of clarification or performance editing required. 
11.	Demonstrate expertise with designing and implementing exemplary program activities that respond to the requirements of the Government Performance and Reporting Act.
12.	Provide documentation that proves leadership in designing web sites from scratch, redesigning web sites to more effectively address customer needs, and creatively and quickly design new components/pages for existing web sites that are Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act compliant with only broad guidance.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of the Brand Name Component, Monaco System Transceivers, or Industry EQUIVALENTS, as described below, for multiple upcoming construction projects at the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY for 2009 through 2012.  No awards will be made from this Sources Sought Notice. No solicitation will be available at this time.  However, responses to this Sources Sought Notice will be used to determine an appropriate acquisition strategy for future acquisitions.<BR>The New York District intends to solicit and award multiple construction projects for the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY for 2009 through 2012. The multiple construction projects will be solicited competitively under future separate solicitations.  These projects will include a Brand Name Only component, as described below, unless the results of this sources sought notification indicates otherwise. <BR>This notification serves three purposes: (1) to notify potential offerors of the Governments intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction projects for 2009 through 2012 and (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and (3) notification of the Army's intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, system Monaco, as described below.  The Monaco System Transceiver is embedded in the multiple construction projects, which projects will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the projects requiring the Monaco System Transceiver is sole source if no sources are able to provide an equivalent system. In the event no equivalent equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or system(s) in the event an equivalent product is not submitted for consideration. In such instances, the brand name or equal component will be embedded in the construction project that will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring brand name components will be sole source if no sources are able to prove an equal product.  Supplies will be providing the brand name component to the contractor under the future solicitation for the construction of the project, not directly to the Government.<BR>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT: The fire alarm systems at the United States Military Academy provide the vital link in the protection of lives and property, via notification to building occupants and the Post Fire Department should a fire occur.  To accomplish the goal of protecting life and property, and to accomplish the mission of the Academy, a reliable receiving and reporting system is an absolute necessity.<BR>The existing fire alarm equipment at the United States Military Academy is the Monaco M-2 Fire Alarm Control Panels.  The Monaco M-2 Fire Alarm Control Panel contains an integral radio transmitter capable of transmitting up to sixty (60) fire alarm/supervisory signals and sixty (60) trouble zone signals.  Additionally there are four (4) zones that identify addressable devices and various trouble conditions (i.e. smoke detector maintenance alerts).  The addressable M-2 supports up to 1584 addressable devices, requiring only inexpensive plug-in cards for expansion.  The M-2 Fire Alarm Control Panels at West Point originally used the Monaco D-700 Central Radio Control Alarm receiving system at Fire Dispatch.  However in 2008, the Monaco D-700 was upgraded to a D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Control Alarm receiving system.  No other product has been found that can be considered interchangeable with or equal to the Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.  The only remote transceivers that will communicate with this make of base transceiver are the Monaco Model BTX family of transceivers.  <BR>The required features of the BTX-F (Fire) Alarm Building Transceiver are as follows:<BR>(1) Hardwire line or narrowband radio communication with any of the D-21 Fire Management System; <BR>(2) Narrowband radio is FCC certified for narrowband operation and meets the requirements of the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Frequency Management; <BR>(3) Radio communication with the D-21; <BR>(4) Provides audio and fire alarm overrides for mass notification per UFC and NFPA; <BR>(5) Provides automatic and manual control of local or remote devices such as turning on pumps based on timed events, input from a fire alarm control panel, or manually activated from the D-21; <BR>(6) Provides eight relay driver outputs and four supervised zone inputs; <BR>(7) Eight onboard open-collector relay driver outputs can connect to the BTX-F relay board or to relay coils that remotely control equipment such as pump activation inputs, HVAC dampers, lighting, door openers, runway barriers, and gates. These outputs can also drive remote enunciator LEDs; <BR>(8) Four supervised fire zone inputs for connection to fire detection and monitoring devices located within 15 feet of the BTX-F; these are supervised for open (trouble), short (alarm), single-ground fault, and double-ground fault conditions; <BR>(9) Four zone LEDs (one for each zone) reflect the condition of the zones: trouble, alarm, or normal; <BR>(10) Status LEDs reflect the status of the BTX-F: general alarm, general trouble, system fault, in-communication, carrier detect, transmit, primary power, battery boost charge, and battery float charge; <BR>(11) Supports up to 7 zone expansion backplanes into which fire zone cards can be plugged <BR>(12) Each zone expansion card provides four zone inputs and eight relay outputs for connection to local or remotely located devices; <BR>(13) Each expansion card has five LEDs: the PWR LED indicates power is being supplied to the card; the remaining four LEDs indicate the status of the four zone inputs; <BR>(14) Each BTX-F can support up to 60 zones and 8 relay outputs with 14 expansion cards installed <BR>(15) One selectable RS-422/RS-485 port for communication with peripheral equipment or connection to a local access controller. <BR>(16) Two full-duplex RS-232 ports used to program the BTX-F via connection to a laptop computer or for connection to peripheral equipment that does not have a RS-422 port/RS-485 port; <BR>(17) 115 or 230 Vac power monitored with automatic switchover to backup battery power that provides standby power; the number of hours depends on the battery <BR>(18) Self test, stuck transmitter disconnect, reset, acknowledge, and battery reconnect switches; <BR>(19) Local audible alert; <BR>Any vendor wishing to provide a system that is compatible with the existing Monaco system must provide a copy of its brochure and any other data by 15 calendar days from date of issue, NO LATER THAN 23 FEBRUARY 2009, 4:00 PM EST, to Contract Specialist, CPT Sean P. Imbs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, N.Y., New York 10278.<BR>This is a market survey and notification of intent only. This is not a request to respond to a solicitation. This project will be solicited at a future date. <BR>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT DESCRIPTION:
MARKET RESEARCH. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research for potential sources to manufacture a government designed Plate Carrier (PC) system. The PC system will require a body armor solution that allows commanders to maintain the same direct fire protection as currently fielded USMC tactical vests by allowing for the tradeoff of some indirect fire protection area of coverage in order to reduce weight and thermal load, and increase Marine mobility and lethality. The PC will be comprised of a vest with sewn in soft armor panels that provides indirect fire protection a minimum of one-half inch beyond the area of coverage provided by the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert (ESAPI) plate. It differs from currently fielded USMC tactical vests in that the area of coverage is reduced to the minimum acceptable area for use with the ESAPI plate. The total weight and associated thermal burden are minimized thereb! y enhancing the individual Marine's mobility and lethality. The Government PC technical data package is not currently available but a copy of Purchase Description Body Armor, Multiple Threat/Interceptor, CO/PD 00-02G is being provided as an attachment to this sources sought in order to familiarize respondents with the format and general information that will be provided in the final technical data package.  The primary differences between the information provide in CO/PD 00-02G and the final technical data package will be related to patterns and the use of coyote brown 498 in place of Universal Camouflage. Significant changes in materials or methods/techniques used in assembly are not being contemplated at this time.
REQUEST FOR WRITTEN RESPONSES:

The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (LM/AQM), Department of State, is processing this acquisition at the request of the Radio Programs Branch. This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of Pro-Type Industries, Inc. equipment under a sole-source justification. In order to avoid the high cost of purchasing complete HF base stations we are seeking to have a custom chassis produced to convert 150 HF mobile radios (currently in stock) into bases stations. The supplies and services requested are not available as COTS end items and are customized for RPB based on dimensions and design elements. Pro-Type Industries, Inc. provides design, prototyping, fabrication, and production services of custom products and has specific knowledge of the design elements RPB requires to manufacture the items sought. Furthermore, because Pro-Type Industries, Inc. has already developed a prototype for RPB, it would be cost prohibitive to obtain production units from another vendor, as the process would need to be repeated and another prototype would need to be developed. The Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM), Radio Programs Branch (RPB) requires the procurement of this equipment from Pro-Type. Limitation of competition under simplified acquisition procedures is permitted when justified by FAR 13.501 and 41 USCode 253(c)(1). An extensive internet search was conducted to identify potential vendors. Due to the custom nature of the products desired, it is essential that the vendor be able to provide rapid in-person response during the design and manufacturing phases.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NESDIS Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Team intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ilex Engineering, Inc. using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13. The NESDIS/Ground Systems Division has a requirement to provide Enhanced software, installation, running tests and training for the administrators. The NOAA Wallops Command and Acquisition Station (WCDAS) located in Wallops island Virginia, supports a variety of data collection activities and is responsible for world-wide dissemination of this data. Two of these systems are the Local Readout Ground Stations (LRGS) and the Low Rate Information Transfer (LRIT) systems.
<p>The LRIT and the LRGS were developed and installed by Ilex Engineering. Two years ago, ILEX Engineering wrote software for the Wallops LRGS machines to generate files containing DCS data, and then to send them to Suitland via network for insertion into the LRIT uplink data stream. These software based systems are relied upon to provide data to NOAA's world-wide customers, as well as to other NOAA subsystems for real-time dissemination. The LRGS and the LRIT systems are both software applications that are resident on the same two servers, with one server configured as primary and the other as an off line backup.</p>
<p>The Wallops LRGS is part of a larger network that is used for the ingest and dissemination of all of the GOES Data Collection System (DCS) data. This data includes the monitoring of routine data measurements as well as critical data (volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, fires, etc.) The Wallops LRIT application resides on the same server as the LRGS application and makes use of the same DCS data to form file packets for transmission to Suitland, Md. where the data is inserted into the GOES Low Rate Information Transmission (LRIT) stream.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 81390, small business size 6.5. mill. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Amy.Sanderswhite@noaa.gov or faxed to (301) 713-0806 by February 20, 2009. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-30. The determination to compete or not compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NESDIS Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Team intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Lee Technologies Services, Inc. using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13. The National Weather Telecommunications Operations Center has a requirement to provide maintenance for MGE uninteruptable power supply (UPS) and associated equipment located at the backup site. This is one base year with two option years.
<p>The National Weather Service Telecommunications Gateway (TG) is a critical link in the national and global infrastructure that collects and distributes weather data. The NWSTG, operating in a real time environment, ensures NWS meets its mission to provide weather and flood warnings; public forecasts; and, advisories for the entire United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean areas. The Continuity of Operations Plan for the TG depends upon having a back-up facility (the BTG) at a remote site which is capable of being activated in time of emergency to assure that the NWS can carry out is mission.</p>
<p>The BTG at the Mt. Weather Emergency Operations Center, a FEMA site, is comprised of all the essential switching and network systems to provide an effective means of back-up. These electronic systems must, however, be continuously protected against any electric power fluctuations or outages by means of the UPS and PDUs. These latter systems, therefore, require on-going maintenance and provision for emergency repair service.</p>

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Bosnia and Herzegovina in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement completion contract to implement a three-year plus one-year option program entitled the Fostering Agricultural Markets Activity (FARMA).
Under the planned activity, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) seek to provide technical assistance and/or services to expand environmentally sustainable production, processing and sales of value-added agricultural products in Bosnia-Herzegovina through the implementation of this three year program. Each donor has agreed to contribute $7 million over the three-year plus one-year option life of project for a total of $13.2 - $14 million (subject to congressional and parliamentary appropriations).
FARMA will assist BiH agriculture producers and processors to improve their ability to withstand pressures emanating from the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and EU (European Union) accession process, and also to enable ag-businesses to capture opportunities in domestic, regional and EU markets emanating from activation of CEFTA and the EU accession process.  FARMA will provide targeted, demand-driven support to farmers, cooperatives, market integrators and food processors and help address constraints along the entire value chain in selected sub-sectors.  In addition, FARMA will provide private sector -identified and -driven policy assistance in cooperation with farmer-associations, cooperatives and SMEs, fostering a better policy environment for market-efficient agricultural production and food processing in BiH.  
The two bilateral donors of Sweden and the United States, have agreed to a Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA) for FARMA. USAID will carry out procurement steps to competitively select an implementer, and will conduct contract administration on behalf of the two donors.  Both donors will be engaged in strategic management and oversight of FARMA.  Although USAID will have the direct relationship to the contractor and is charged with contract administration, the donor ownership over project strategy and implementation is equal and shared among the two donors.  
This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. 
Firms or organizations and subcontractors whose their source, origin and nationality is in countries party to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and the cooperating country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are eligible to compete. At this time, 39 countries, including European Union (EU) member states and the United States, are parties to the Agreement.
USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S and non- U.S. firms, small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business in this activity as prime contractor or as subcontractor. 
Interested firms can register and use the Interested Vendor List (IVL) accessible on the FedBizOpps page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $7 million.
In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. The solicitation is posted herewith at FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov). Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFP will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. 
Please do not contract USAID/BiH. All communication must be through this office. The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
I
nformal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>The USCG Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement for repair/refurbishment and requesting quotes for the following: 1) NSN 2920-12-305-2407, STARTER, ENGINE, ELECTRICAL, BOSCH ROBERT GMBH, Part number: 680S638P01 Quantity 4 EA in accordance with the following overhaul description:

PRELIMINARY INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:

Each Starter Motor shall be inspected as received to determine the extent of required repairs.  The contractor shall provide a cost estimate that includes all labor hours, material and parts to overhaul/repair the Starter Motor.  The serial number of the Starter Motor shall be included on the cost estimate.

Additionally, each Starter Motor shall be inspected and verified to have a thirteen (13) tooth bendix drive gear and a five (5) lug terminal configuration.  If the bendix drive gear or terminal lug configuration is not as stated, no further work shall be accomplished and the U.S. Coast Guard Contracting Officer shall be notified.

OVERHAUL REQUIREMENT:
The Starter Motor shall be overhauled/repaired to a condition which shall restore the operating and performance characteristics to the Robert Bosch GMBH Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) design specifications and standards.  The overhaul shall be performed in accordance with OEM specifications and standards to include upgrades as applicable.  

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
Each Starter Motor shall have a tag attached to a connection terminal annotating the overhaul facility name and address.

Each Starter Motor shall have a tag attached to terminal 50 with instructions for the end user to ensure the jam nut is properly secured while tightening down the terminal cable hold-down nut. 

After completion of the overhaul/repair of the Starter Motor, the contractor shall perform standard production tests to assure maximum design performance to include but not limited to the following tests:

Each terminal on each Starter Motor shall be checked for its ground wall insulation resistance value to the Starter Motor case after final assembly using a 500 volt meggohmeter.

The final test reading shall not be less than 100 meggohms on a meter scale of R x 1000 minimum.  The megger shall have a current calibration which shall not have exceeded one year since the previous calibration.  Prior to conducting the test, both megger test leads shall be attached to the Starter Motor case and a reading of zero ohms shall be obtained, thus assuring an adequate ground connection to the Starter Motor case.  The ground lead shall remain connected and NOT be removed or relocated prior to any insulation resistance test.  If the ground lead is removed for ANY reason, the Starter Motor zero reading shall be verified using the procedure described above prior to the final test.

When insulation is exposed to a humid atmosphere, it absorbs moisture and the insulation resistance decreases.  Additionally, the amount of moisture absorption is increased by the amount of time the insulation is exposed to a humid atmosphere.  The resistance value also depends upon the type of insulation and its condition.  Since moisture may be driven off or evaporated by the application of heat, the insulation resistance of a winding having a low resistance reading, due to the presence of moisture, may be restored by energizing or externally heating the winding.  Therefore, the Starter Motor can be heated prior to the test.  Regardless of the test conditions, the Starter Motor shall not have a resistance value below 100 meggohms.  The contractor may, at his discretion, conduct the test in a controlled environment.  After any application of heat to the Starter Motors exterior, the Starter Motor shall be allowed to cool to ambient temperature, prior to the final pass fail insulation resistance test.  (Pass=greater than 100 meggohms). 
  
The contractor shall provide a Certificate of Conformance for each Starter Motor; one copy shall be placed in each box with the Starter Motor and one copy shall be forwarded to the Coast Guard Contracting Officer.


WARRANTY:

__X_ A. Standard Manufacturers Warranty

____ B. Item being repaired as an “onboard repair” or “system stock” item and will be put into inventory.  NOT FOR IMMEDIATE INSTALLATION.  Contractor must guarantee item against defects that lead to failure for 90 days after installation for a period of up two (2) years after delivery to Coast Guard.

PRESERVATION:

Each Starter Motor shall be coated on the external surfaces with white paint to a dry film thickness of 3-5 mils. 

PRESERVATION / PACKAGING:

PACKAGING/PACKING:
Each Starter Motor shall be individually packed in a wooden box with internal bracing which shall be capable of providing adequate protection during storage and multiple shipments.  

The shaft of each Starter Motor shall be blocked and protected so that force applied in any direction during shipping and handling will not cause damage to the shaft.

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK <br />Removal of PAC units 12 and 13 in <br />B8510 room 180D
<p>20 Jan 09</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction/Background: 1 ASTS is expanding and upgrading the Consolidated Launch Control Room (CLCC), B8510 room 180D Vandenberg AFB CA. To make room for Ground Support Equipment (GSE) that launch teams will be using to control launch vehicles, space will need to be freed up.</p>
<p>2.0 Objectives: The objective of this task is two-fold:</p>
<p>2.1 Remove Process Air Conditioners (PAC) units 12 and 13 from B8510 room 180D while maintaining functionality of PAC unit 9 in room 180C.</p>
<p>2.1.1 Remove PAC unit's #12 and #13 and source power wiring between Room 190 and 180D. Breakers in room 190 to be labeled "Spare". Conduit to be cut just above ceiling in room 180D. All associated wiring, conduit, and disconnect switches below ceiling and floor in Room 180D are to be removed, being careful not to remove or disturb other under floor circuits or COMM lines.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Contractor will need to isolate chilled water loop, drain and capture. Once PAC #13 is remove loop will be severed. Reconnect loop above false ceiling in room 180D to keep active for PAC #9 in room 180C. Cut and cap chilled water supply and return lines within one foot of main loop supply and return lines above room 197. Contractor will need to return drained glycol back to the chilled water loop and dispose of the rest per environmental requirements.</p>
<p>2.1.3 Transport PAC units #12 and #13 to DRMO. (DMRO-Bldg. 7420, 805-606-9852)</p>
<p>2.1.4 Repair floor under where PPU's and PAC's were installed. This should also include floor tiles where chilled water lines and power conduits created holes as a result of this project. Floor is believed to be in sound condition with jacks and floor trusses in place. Contractor will need to verify. Some floor jacks, truss supports, and gaskets are on site can be used if necessary. There are adequate numbers of floor tiles on site, but approximately four each will need to be cut to size. (Contact Facility Manager Randal Hunt, 805-605-2794 for floor tiles)</p>
<p>2.1.5 Reference Attachment 2 &amp; 3 for further detail.</p>
<p>2.2 Remove Two Power Distribution Units (PDU) and the associated wiring.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Remove (2) PDUs 100-3 and 200-3 in room 180D and the source wiring back to UPS in Room 190. Leave pull string in each conduit for future use. Cut conduit just above ceiling line in Room 180D. (2) Two breakers in Room 190 to be labeled "Spare".</p>
<p>2.2.2 Reference Attachment 1, drawing 800VR160009 for further detail.</p>
<p>2.2.3 Remove all Room 180D PDU output power conduits and wiring "under the floor" including two each emergency shut off switches and related conduit, being careful not to remove or disturb other under floor circuits or COMM lines. Due to no accurate drawings of these circuits contractors will have to estimate the number of circuits base of panel schedule details, which there are a combined total of 24 each 10 amp circuits. All circuits in question within Room 180D.</p>
<p>2.2.4 Once the PDU's in Room 180D have been removed they can be delivered to DRMO on base.</p>
<p>3.0 Requirements: The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, equipment, tools, materials, and work effort to remove the two PAC units (12 &amp; 13) from B8510 room 180D and the two PDUs.</p>
<p>3.1 This effort requires a through walk down, by appointment with the facility manager, to identify all power sources and glycol lines to be disconnected/removed or reconfigured. <br />3.2 All work that will impact facility power and water will be coordinated and scheduled with the facility manager.<br />3.3 This effort includes removing excess glycol lines attached to the units in such a way as to ensure the continued use of PAC unit 9 in room 180C (next to 180D). <br />3.4 Excess glycol and glycol contaminated materials will be removed and disposed of in a manner consistent with state and local environmental regulations.<br />3.5 Upon completion of all plumbing work a leakage test must be completed and reported to the facility manager.<br />3.6 All wiring will be removed and disposed of at DRMO.<br />3.7 All wire ways will be removed so that they terminate above the drop ceiling in 180D and to a safe height in the facility electrical rooms.<br />3.8 A pull rope will be left in place in each abandoned conduit for possible future installs.<br />3.9 All disconnected circuits will have their circuit breakers tagged as spares.<br />3.10 All electrical work shall comply with NEC standards.<br />3.11 All work shall be accomplished in accordance with all contract specifications, common work practices, and industry and OSHA standards.<br />3.12 Facility drawings will be "redlined" to show changes to the PDU and PAC systems (glycol/power).<br />3.13 Facility escorts will be provided by the 1 ASTS. The contractor will not need personnel with facility badges.</p>

Filing Agency Protests

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSES:
The Contracting Officer received the following questions related to DJMS-09-Q-0016.  Government responses are provided below.  As a result, the due date for receipt of quotes IS NOT extended.

QUESTION 1:
What are the specifications for the trailer that the power unit will be mounted on?

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION 1:
The specifications are:  Length – Maximum114”, Width– Maximum 68”, Height – Maximum 66”, Ground Clearance – Minimum 9”, Fifth Wheel Turntable Steering
Brakes – Hand/Lever Activated

QUESTION 2:
The solicitation specifies that the unit must be equipped with replacement filters (Air, fuel and oil) but does not specify a quantity.  Are we to assume, and price a single set of replacement filters for the unit or are more required?

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION 2:
A single set of replacement filters is required.  The fuel filter must be a lubricity type.
 
QUESTION 3:  
Cable extensions are requested, i.e. A/C 90KvA 100 foot cable extension and DC 50 foot cable extensions.  Are these in addition to the 50 Foot A/C and DC cables that will be provided as a part of the power unit? The way we read this, you want to be able to extend the AC cable to reach 150 feet and the DC cable to reach 100 feet.  Is this accurate?

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION 3:
No, the AC cable must be a total of at least 100 feet.  This may require providing another cable in addition to the standard cable provided with the equipment.  The DC cable must total 50 feet which is the upper limit to avoid power loss. 

QUESTION 4:
400Hz output characteristics and specification?

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION 4:
400Hz output characteristics and specifications are 60 kVA, 3 Phase, 4 Wire, 115/200 Volt Wye Continuous 

QUESTION 5:
What are the 28.5vdc transformer-rectifier unit rating and characteristics?

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION 5:
Rating and characteristics are a minimum 600 A Continuous, 2000 A Peak 

QUESTION 6:
Is there any preference for the EPA Tier III diesel engine, e.g., Cummins, Isuzu, etc?

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTION 6:
It appears the Cummins engine meets the specifications but we have no preference.

Answer: No

Question: Will this procurement include the cost of the full replacement of the felt and pool liner if necessary?
Answer: Another version of this question has already been answered. The vendor is to submit its proposal explaining how they will meet the Statement of Work. That proposal is for a firm fixed price contract; see below for further information.

Question: Will this procurement also include the repair of the tank's structure and or foundation if needed?
Answer: Another version of this question has already been answered. Please carefully and completely read this entire solicitation and its amendments. This requirement is for a firm fixed price contract. After award of this contract, if necessary, the contractor shall submit recommendations for any proposed changes that may fall out side of the original scope of the Statement of Work. The contractor shall submit their recommendations with their new proposal in a format to the Government which define the contractor's need for change, scope of change, schedule impact and associated cost to replace the pool liner due to technical obsolence, etc. The contractor may implement changes to the SOW in the future with permission, but these bilateral modifications must not negatively affect the pool's form, fit, function or cause degradation to the system as defined by this SOW.

Question: Is a bid bond required to be submitted with our proposal for the above referenced project?
Answer: No bid bond is required.

Question: What caused the problem?
Answer: A bubble or other problem developed in the tank liner which made us drain the training tank.

Question: Did the tank lose water?
Answer: There was water between the liner and the pool.

Question: What is the floor of the tank made of?
Answer: The entire training tank is made of aluminum.

Question: Is there a ripple behind the pool?
Answer: No, the bubble is visible within the tank; it appears that the liner has stretched within the pool.

Question: Why are we here for a site visit today?
Answer: The training tank liner has moved away from the wall. After we drained the tank, the liner moved back against the wall. There is still residual water against the floor.

Question: What type of proposal do you want?
Answer: The proposal is to answer the Statement of Work, provide solutions to our problem of having an unusable training tank. If something in the SOW does not make sense, then the vendor is to propose something that does. This is a best value procurement; Secret Service wants the training tank fixed and that fix to be warranted so that it will not occur again. We want the leak problem addressed in the problem, along with the vendor's solution, so this problem does not re-occur. We need a lasting solution

Question: Has the pool been patched before? What type of patching? By whom?
Answer: The pool has been patched before. We do not know the type of patching. Vendor information is confidential, as previously discussed.

Question: Is the facility under local jurisdiction?
Answer: This Secret Service facility is Federal.

Question: Has there been corrosion of the aluminum?
Answer: No.

Question: If we win the award, what are the work hours?
Answer: This is a 24-hour facility. Standard working hours are from 6 AM to 4:30 PM Monday through Friday. However, if the vendor proposes working different hours, extended hours or on weekends, as long as the vendor properly compensates their employees, all schedules will be considered.

Question: Does the Davis-Bacon Act apply?
Answer: No, this is not construction. The Service Contract Act will apply.

Question: How old is the liner?
Answer: Fifteen years.

Question: Does the pool auto-fill?
Answer: When operating, the pool is auto-fill.

Question: Is it theoretically possible that there is a leak on the other side of the pool, away from the part with the bubble?
Answer: Theoretically, it is possible but we do not think so.

Question: Could the pool be leaking into the ground? Or is there a concrete barrier?
Answer: There is no concrete barrier; the pool could be leaking or percolating into the ground.

Question: Did you perform a pressure test of the system?
Answer: Secret Service plugged the jets and opened one pump, and the tank held a steady pressure for 10 to 15 minutes. 

Question: Have any cracks been located?
Answer: No.

Question: Would you consider a deadline extension?
Answer: This RFP has been posted since January 22 and we are eager to have this awarded. We will consider any requests for an extension, please include any reason why, what the additional time will provide you, and how long of an extension you need.

Question: Did the water run out?
Answer: There is water still under the liner.

Question: Do you need the drains changed?
Answer: Please review the Statement of Work as that is covered.

Question: Has the pool been leaking underneath?
Answer: We believe it has not.

Question: Is the outside, the bottom, of the pool accessible?
Answer: No.

Question: How do I access the drains?
Answer: From within the training tank.

Question: How did the liner leak occur?
Answer: It was a slow growing leak. The liner appears to be 18 inches off the wall.

Question: Could this problem be a plumbing leak? Do the pipes leak?
Answer: Unknown. Secret Service is seeking pool experts to solve this problem with a five year warranty.

Question: How do I access the shallow end of the pool?
Answer: There is a crawl space.

Question: How long ago was the water drained out?
Answer: About a month ago.

Question: When was the pool patched?
Answer: About three years ago.

Question: When do you empty the pool?
Answer: Only when it is to be repaired.

Question: Was this liner welded in place?
Answer: Yes.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT.  It is the Governments intent to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contract for the investigation and failure analysis of Category 1 Product Quality Deficiency Reports (CAT 1 PQDRs) on aircraft exhibits for the Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED) within the US Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC).   A CAT 1 PQDR describes an unsafe condition, operational or maintenance procedure for an aircraft, mission related equipment, component or module, or repair part that may cause death, injury, or severe occupational illness, that would cause loss or major damage to a weapon system, critically restricts the combat readiness capabilities of the using organization, and which would result in a production line stoppage.  The priority level of these exhibits mandates that the failure analyses be performed in not more than 45 calendar days.  The analyses performed will provide the mode of failure and the root cause determination that includes a determination as to whether or not the pertinent parts in question meet dimensional and other requirements as documented in source drawings.  The proposed period of performance is from AUGUST 2010 through JULY 2015, and may involve performance of 10 to 20 failure analyses per year.<BR> <BR>Offerors must demonstrate the ability to perform CAT 1 PQDR failure analyses by providing at least three sample reports for similar work.  A complete listing of all current analytical equipment and tooling; the average turnaround time and capacity on similar projects; and a list of qualifications for current employees is also requested.  <BR><BR>The Government is seeking to determine whether two or more small businesses are capable of performing the work outlined in the description above.  The Government is asking for responses from all responsible Small Business sources that can demonstrate their capability to perform the work and provide the requested documentation pertaining to the sample report, equipment list and personnel qualifications by the closing date of this sources sought notice.  This information will be used to evaluate each sources capability to perform integration requiring the use of proprietary information and determine whether or not this acquisition will be designated as a small business set-aside or a full and open competition.   <BR><BR>The proposed contract listed herein is being considered for a 100% small business set aside, and is subject to the availability of funds.  By U.S. Law, participation in Small Business Set-Asides is restricted to U.S. small businesses; therefore, submission of information by foreign sources will not be honored.<BR><BR>The most recent AED effort was awarded on a sole source basis to Dayton T Brown under Contract W58RGZ-05-C-0318, a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Basic Contract plus five one-year Options, with a total potential dollar value of approximately $5.0M.<BR><BR>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  Responses to this announcement are due no later than 1600 (CST) on 03 March 2009.  Formal communication related to this Acquisition should be directed to Paula Parker, Contract Specialist.  You may fax, mail, or email the requested information to US Army Aviation and Missile Command, ATTN:  CCAM-RD-RB, Paula Parker/Research Development and Engineering Center, Building 5400, Room B142, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898;  EMAIL: paula.parker1@us.army.mil ;  FAX NUMBER:  (256) 876-7600.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  Respondents are advised that responses sent by conventional US Mail service or courier services (Federal Express and UPS) are not routed directly to the above address.

The goal of the Department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources will be better and more easily remotely accessed. The requirement will be competed as the IT community reponds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of Pro-Type Industries, Inc. equipment under a sole-source justification.  In order to avoid the high cost of purchasing complete HF base stations we are seeking to have a custom chassis produced to convert 150 HF mobile radios (currently in stock) into bases stations. The supplies and services requested are not available as COTS end items and are customized for RPB based on dimensions and design elements. Pro-Type Industries, Inc. provides design, prototyping, fabrication, and production services of custom products and has specific knowledge of the design elements RPB requires to manufacture the items sought.  Furthermore, because Pro-Type Industries, Inc. has already developed a prototype for RPB, it would be cost prohibitive to obtain production units from another vendor, as the process would need to be repeated and another prototype would need to be developed.  The Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM), Radio Programs Branch (RPB) requires the procurement of this equipment from Pro-Type.  Limitation of competition under simplified acquisition procedures is permitted when justified by FAR 13.501 and 41 USCode 253(c)(1).  An extensive internet search was conducted to identify potential vendors.  Due to the custom nature of the products desired, it is essential that the vendor be able to provide rapid in-person response during the design and manufacturing phases.<BR><BR>

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT
In accordance with Section 3.2.1.2.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS), the Academic Community and Aviation Industry are hereby informed that the FAA has future requirements in systems engineering with a focus on developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  It is anticipated that these requirements will be fulfilled under a cooperative agreement entitled: The NextGen Systems Engineering & Environmental (NSEE) Program.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be interpreted as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  Since this is a market survey seeking interested sources, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
The purpose of this announcement is to determine interest in the university community and its potential partners (private and/or other public institutions). Each institution and organization should have the established technical research capabilities and academic curriculum necessary to participate as a potential team member, affiliate, or industry partner with FAA under the proposed NextGen Systems Engineering & Environmental (NSEE) Program.  
This market survey also seeks to identify subcontracting opportunities and direct contract/agreement opportunities for universities (particularly Minority Serving Institutions, such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Native American Serving Institutions (NASIs) among others).
It is the intent of the FAA to enter into cooperative agreements with the successful team(s).  In addition, under a cooperative agreement the FAA will also provide for IPA (Intergovernmental Personnel Arrangements) assignments and OTAs (Other Transaction Arrangements) as deemed necessary.  IPAs allow for continued knowledge, personnel exchange, and augmentation of internal resources through the exchange of personnel.  An OTA is an agreement between the FAA and a non-Federal entity (either foreign or domestic) where the FAA's purpose is to obtain a direct benefit that advances the agency's mission while also providing assistance to the general public.  
Results from this market survey will assist the FAA in determining the method and type of procurement competition - full and open; limited; or sole source.  
The cooperative agreement(s) is/are anticipated to last ten (10) years in duration. The agreement(s) will provide the terms and conditions for the potential contracts, grants, Intergovernmental Personnel Assignments (IPAs), other transaction arrangements (OTAs).  The total combined award(s) are not expected to exceed $140 million.

<DESC><p>Pre-solicitation Notice Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) Barracks, Brigade Complex 2, Phase 3, Fort Drum, Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV).<br /><br />The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Mr. Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at Errette.J.Slick@usace.army.mil <br /><br />FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative. The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide. The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities. The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses. SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities. The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK &amp; TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. <br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK: <br /><br />Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities: <br /><br />Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH):<br /><br />UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector. The soldiers room shall include, but not be limited to: private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom, kitchenette, laundry facilities, and other amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work. The varying components for this facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features. Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements. It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.<br /><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: This solicitation will be evaluated under the Single Phase Design Build Process. Interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) will submit certain specified performance capability information, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability information in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation. <br /><br />Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal. The Government will evaluate the proposals, in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering past performance, technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost. To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award. In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee. <br /><br />The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Volume I Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach; Volume II - DESIGN TECHNICAL: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design, and Sustainability. Volume III - REMAINING PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY AND SMALL BUSINESS UTILIZATION: Remaining Performance Capability; Proposed Task Order Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns. All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price. <br /><br />Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 30 Jan 2009 under solicitation number W9126G-09-R-0013. Proposals are anticipated to be due approximately on or about 9 Mar 09. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542. The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million. This solicitation will be issued as unrestricted. <br /><br />MATOC: The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation. In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation. If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude. The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition. Each contract will remain active: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government. It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation. Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type. Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior. The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination. <br /><br />The total estimated contract capacity is $420,000,000. The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months. The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government. The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only. Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. The minimum task order limitation is $15,000,000. The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $100,000,000. The maximum combination of orders is $100,000,000. The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.

Hancock, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at David.l.Hancock@usace.army.mil.<br /><br />FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative. The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide. The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities. The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses. SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities. The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK &amp; TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. <br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK: <br /><br />Advanced Individual Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks, or other similar facilities: <br /><br />Advanced Individual Training Complexes:<br />AIT complexes are comprised of multiple facilities, consisting of Barracks/Company Operations Facilities (BCOF), Dining Facilities (DFAC), Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ), Support Facilities, and Outdoor Areas. AIT Complexes are designed as training facilities. AIT Complexes will be programmed as a unit, rather than as individual facilities as the complete battalion drives the overall functionality of the facility. Included are functional, operational, and spatial relationships critical to meeting battalion training requirements which are embedded in the operational layout of the facilities. All facility types will meet DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, latest edition.<br /><br />The BCOF is comprised of sleeping, latrine, classrooms, storage, and company operations components. As the BCOF is designed for able-bodied soldiers, the facility is not required to meet ADA compliance. Each two-person living suite has a minimum population of two and may be increased to a maximum population of three to accommodate population surges.<br /><br />The DFAC is will be procured through Norfolk District contracts. <br /><br />The BN HQ facility will be procured through the Fort Worth District under separate solicitation action.<br /><br />The AIT Site includes Outside Areas such as; a jogging track, physical training (PT) pits, vehicular and service access drives and parking areas.

A living room, laundry and full service kitchen shall be shared by the room module occupants. Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work. <br /><br />The Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) serves as a transitional facility, which bridges the gap between in the transition between family assistance and assisting the soldier in personal adjustments. Soldier assistance by family members is critical element in the recovery from injuries. Child care areas, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistance type functions to accommodate both the soldier and their families are provided in this facility. <br /><br />All of the WIT facilities together form a complex and provides a cohesive mission in the healing process of the soldier. The Government reserves the right to solicit this facility type separately, if determined to be in the best interests of the Government, through approval of an amendment to the acquisition plan. It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders. <br /><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: This solicitation will be evaluated under the Single Phase Design Build Process. Interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) will submit certain specified performance capability information, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability information in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation. <br /><br />Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal. The Government will evaluate the proposals, in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering past performance, technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost. To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award. In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee. <br /><br />The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Volume I Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach; Volume II: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; and Sustainability Requirements. Volume III: Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns. All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price. <br /><br />Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 30 Jan 2009 under solicitation number W9126G-09-R-0009. Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 9 Mar 2009.

The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million. This solicitation will be issued as unrestricted. <br /><br />MATOC: The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation. In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation. If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude. The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition. Each contract will remain active: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government. It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation. Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type. Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior. The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination. <br /><br />The total estimated contract capacity is $499,500,000. The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months. The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government. The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only. Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. The minimum task order limitation is $15,000,000. The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $75,000,000. The maximum combination of orders is $100,000,000. The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price. <br /><br />The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition. There will be no public bid opening.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ISSUED UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 19.10 AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The target ceiling for contract award for design and construction is $14,500,000.00. The Government cannot guarantee that additional funds can be made available for award. Offerors are under no obligation to approach this amount. This project is for the Design and Construction of a Hazardous Material Response Facility consisting of a laboratory, conference and general use space for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency at the Pentagon Reservation in Arlington, Virginia. 

The Design-Build process will have two distinct phases. Phase-I will be the pre-qualification process, where the Government will select 3 to 5 Design-Build Contractors on the basis of Project Organization and Personnel, Offeror's Experience and Resource Commitment, Management Control Systems, Past Performance, Management/Technical Compliance Certification, and Financial Capacity. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Project Organization and Personnel being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important.

Only the selected Design-Build Contractors will then qualify for the Phase-II of the process. In Phase-II of the procurement procedure, offerors will be given the opportunity to offer their preliminary design and cost proposals. Final selection and basis for award of the design-build contract will be on the basis of Qualifications, Technical Quality, Price, and Other Salient Factors considered being in the Government's best interests. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Qualifications being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important. This is not a low bid award project. If awarded the contract, the offeror shall complete the design and construction documents and construct the facility in compliance with these completed requirements. The building could be two stories and shall be sited to increase visibility and impact from the initial approach to the building. The Design/Build Contractor shall design the new building shall complement other structures in the area around the building. However, design and construction creativity and innovation is encouraged. 

Plans and Specifications will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Web Page at http://www.fbo.gov/. Offerors may register on the Interested Vendors List (IVL) at http://www.fbo.gov/ and retrieve an IVL from the same location.
