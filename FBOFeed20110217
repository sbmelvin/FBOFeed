<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION (NOPCA).  This Hanscom AFB Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposal Contract Action (NOPCA) for proposed award of a sole source contract to L-3 Communications Corporation, Communication System, East Division, Camden, NJ. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". In this case the United States Air Force (USAF) may deem products and/or services to be available only from the original sources in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized products or services when it is likely that awardto any other source would result in an unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B)). The Government intends to purchase contractor support for the test and evaluation period for the Key Translation Element (KTE) and Central Advanced Extremely. This effort will provide End-to-End (ETE) support to Key Management Architecture (KMA) test events, along with other logistic and engineering support for sustainment, testing, and limited operational engineering for the AEHF COMSEC/TRANSEC System (ACTS).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations/proposals; however the government will consider all responses received within 15 business days of the issuance of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. Point of Contacts: Patrick N. Jackson, Contracting Officer, Phone (210) 925-1780, Email Patrick.jackson.1@us.af.mil.  Interested subcontractors should contact L-3 Communications Corporation directly. See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- COMMON CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT INFORMATION BASE
<SOLNBR>RFI_CCMIB
<RESPDATE>032411

<CONTACT>LATOYA PAYNE latoya.payne@us.af.mil

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)About Common Cryptographic Management Information Base
This Request for Information (RFI) is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 (Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes - Oct 1997) and is published only to obtain information for use by the United States Air Force Electronic Systems Center Cryptologic Systems Division, Cryptographic Modernization Program Office (AF CMPO), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, for market research and planning purposes only.
This RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation, it is intended for information or planning purposes only.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any potential offeror's ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released. Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in response to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. Submittals will not be returned to the sender. Respondents of this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals.
The AF CMPO is in the process of designing and specifying a Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3)-based black-side management technology suite suitable for managing End Cryptographic Units, (ECUs).  This effort is related to the development and final release of the Internet Engineer Task Force Request for Comments Document 5953 (IETF RFC 5953), an alternative to SNMP's User-Based Security Model.  It also includes ongoing discussions about Management Information Base (MIB) modules for SNMP, and refining some preliminary development activities with regard to unifying a common architecture for MIB modules for managing cryptographic functions.
The Common Cryptographic Management Information Base (CC MIB) precept is a refined architectural concept for the development and standardization of a set of MIB modules which encapsulate and typify the management actions necessary to manage a cryptographic appliance through the full product lifecycle (initialization, use, and retirement).  It is anticipated that the CC MIB architecture resulting from this activity will have a core set of cryptographic capabilities common to all cryptographic appliances and a primary set of extensions, which each specify the management activities necessary/customary to a particular family (e.g., serial link encryptor, IP encryptor, radio encryptor, etc.). The architecture should also be extensible, enabling and standardizing the maximal set of management activities common to all cryptographic appliances, but also allow for vendor-proprietary extensions within the architecture. These vendor-proprietary extensions are regarded as those that spe! cify vendor-specific capabilities neither common to any particular cryptographic appliance family nor common to all cryptographic appliances as implemented today.  Overall, the intent is to provide an open-standard, non-proprietary CC MIB module definition that can be used as a baseline for standardization through a recognized standards body, and also utilized by Type-1 ECU vendors for integration into their products to provide standardized secure ECU management to the Government.
The CMPO is seeking industry comments to the initial draft of the CC MIB, as well as answers to the questions below.  For access to the draft CC MIB artifacts, please send an email digitally signed by a valid DoD External Certificate Authority issued certificate to latoya.payne.1@us.af.mil and mark.delarosa@us.af.mil.
1.	What problems, if any, do you see with the encoding, format, or overall structure of the CC MIB?
2.	What organization improvements would you recommend to the CC MIB?3.	What family specific extensions do you think should be added to the CC MIB?
4.	What functionality do you see as missing and/or extraneous in the CC MIB?
5.	What functionality do you think belongs in each family specific extension to the core module?
6.	What functionality would you propose placing in vendor specific extensions?
7.	Do you believe that the vendor specific extensions should be tied to each family of ECUs or do you believe that it should be a different category under the core? Why?
8.	What additional documentation is desirable in order to implement the CC MIB in an existing product line?
9.	Conformance groups and statements are proposed in the initial draft of the CC MIB.  What changes to or additional conformance groups or statements are desirable?
In addition to the above listed questions, please provide the following business information:
10.	Please provide your cage code and business size.  a.	If you are a Small Business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories: 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, HUBZone, etc)  
11.	For small business consideration, would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 334111, 334119, 334210, 334220, 334290, 334419, 517919, or 541330?  If not, why?
12.	Are you on one or more GSA schedules?  If so, which one(s)?
Submissions shall not exceed thirty (30) 8.5 X 11 inch, single-sided pages.  Vendors who submit information for review do so with the understanding that U.S. Government personnel as well as their support contractors will review their material and data. Respondents will not be contacted regarding their submission or information gathered as a result of this notice nor the outcome of the Government's review of the solicited information unless the Government desires further information. Submitted information packages will be retained by the Government and not returned to the contractor.
All interested, capable and responsible sources that wish to respond to this RFI are required to electronically supply their responses (.doc or .pdf format) in the order and format in which they are presented, to latoya.payne.1@us.af.mil and mark.delarosa@us.af.mil no later than 1600 hrs CT,              24 March 2011.

<DESC>THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE.
REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTERESTLONG-TERM MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE OF ELEMENTAL MERCURY
I.  OBJECTIVE OF THE REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.  NO PROPOSALS ARE ALLOWED.  
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking Expressions of Interest from the private sector regarding potential locations for a facility or facilities where DOE can store and manage elemental mercury pursuant to the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (the Act).  The Act directs DOE to designate by January 1, 2010, a facility or facilities of DOE for the long-term management and storage of elemental mercury.  At least one such facility must be operational by January 1, 2013.
DOE intends to initiate an Environmental Impact Statement in early 2009 and seeks to identify facilities to consider as potential alternatives.  Accordingly, respondents to this Request for Expressions of Interest may have the facilities they identify considered during the environmental review scoping process.  The environmental review will also analyze the potential environmental impacts of storing elemental mercury at one or more DOE or other Federal facilities.
This Request for Expressions of Interest is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals.
II.  GENERAL INFORMATION
The Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 prohibits the export of elemental mercury from the United States effective January 1, 2013.  To ensure that elemental mercury is managed and stored safely, the Act directs DOE to take a number of actions.  By October 1, 2009, DOE must issue guidance establishing standards and procedures for the receipt, management and long-term storage of elemental mercury generated within the United States at a facility or facilities of DOE.  DOE must designate such facilities by January 1, 2010, but is prohibited by the Act from locating such a facility at DOE's Oak Ridge Reservation.  At least one such facility must be operational by January 1, 2013.  
In addition to the standards and procedures referenced above, elemental mercury managed and stored at a designated facility will be subject to the requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)), 42 U.S.C. ? 6901 et seq.  A designated facility in existence on or before January 1, 2013, is authorized to operate under interim status pursuant to RCRA section 3005(e), 42 U.S.C. ? 6925(e), until a final decision on a permit application is made pursuant to RCRA section 3005(c), 42 U.S.C. ? 6925(c).  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or an authorized State, shall issue a final decision on the permit application by January 1, 2015.
Currently elemental mercury in the United States comes from several sources, including mercury used in the chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing process, mercury reclaimed from recycling and waste recovery activities, and mercury generated as a byproduct of the gold mining process.  In a November 2007 "Mercury Storage Costs Estimates" report, EPA assumed the total amount of excess mercury supply from commercial sources that would require storage to be between 7,500 and 10,000 metric tons over 40 years.  The 7,500 metric ton scenario assumes that approximately 1,200 metric tons would come from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants, approximately 2,050 metric tons would come from product recycling and waste recovery, and approximately 4,250 metric tons would be a byproduct of gold mining.  The 10,000 metric ton scenario assumes that an additional 2,500 metric tons would result from imports.  There are uncertainties associated with these estimates, and DOE anticipates updating thes e estimates in conjunction with its activities to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
In addition, DOE currently stores approximately 1,200 metric tons of elemental mercury at its Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee.  Also, the Department of Defense (DOD) stores approximately 4,400 metric tons at various locations.  At this time, no decision has been made as to how much elemental mercury from DOE or DOD would be stored in the DOE-designated facilities required by the Act.
As required by Council on Environmental Quality and DOE NEPA regulations, DOE's designation of facilities for the purpose of long-term management and storage of elemental mercury generated in the United States must include consideration of the range of reasonable management and storage alternatives and the environmental impacts of those alternatives.  The purpose of this Request is to determine if there is interest on the part of commercial entities in proposing locations for long-term DOE management and storage facilities.  Identification of such facilities will enable DOE to consider them for potential inclusion in its NEPA review.
Consideration of a facility in the environmental review process is not a guarantee of its selection.  Proposed sites and facilities will be reviewed against a series of technical screening criteria to consider their suitability for a long-term elemental mercury management and storage mission.  In addition, in accordance with NEPA implementing regulations, DOE will conduct public outreach, such as a scoping meeting or meetings, for those sites and facilities considered to be reasonable alternatives, to allow the public to comment.
III.  REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST: 
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.  NO PROPOSALS ARE ALLOWED.  
DOE intends to consider a range of reasonable alternatives, including existing and new DOE facilities, in its selection process.  DOE is in the process of conducting an inventory of its national complex to determine potential alternative facilities.  Likewise, DOE is also seeking by this action expressions of interest from commercial entities on locations and facilities for the long-term management and storage of elemental mercury.  Because the Act states that this mercury would be stored at a "facility or facilities of [DOE]", DOE would work, as necessary, with the commercial entity on acquiring an appropriate interest in the facility prior to site designation.  
DOE plans to review each submission to determine if it should be included as a reasonable alternative in DOE's NEPA analysis, which will assess the environmental impacts of each alternative, including existing and new DOE facilities, as they relate to the long-term storage and management of elemental mercury.
As noted above, the amount of mercury to be stored is not well defined.  The size requirements for long-term storage and management facilities will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of elemental mercury ultimately received and the storage configuration of the elemental mercury containers.  Based on currently available information, for planning purposes DOE is looking for locations with one or more existing facilities with a total of approximately 20,000 to 100,000 square feet of storage space, or locations where such facilities could be constructed.  DOE anticipates refining the estimate of required storage space during the environmental review process.  DOE also requires that the facilities be in compliance with all current building codes and construction standards, be located in a geologically stable area (e.g., not in a flood plain or seismically-active zone), and be operated and maintained with appropriate security measures in place.  In addition, the Ac t requires that the facilities obtain and operate in accordance with a RCRA hazardous waste facility permit.
IV.  AREAS TO ADDRESS IN SUBMISSION
DOE requires the following information for each potential storage location and facility:
1.	Name of the company making the Expression of Interest, including a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address;2.	Company address;3.	Company size (please specify as either Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), Hubzone Small Business or other);4.	Name of the city and state in which each potential facility is or would be located;5.	A site map showing the location of the potential storage building or buildings on the site, as well as nearby (within 10 miles) political (e.g., city, county) boundaries, communities (especially minority, low income or Native American), roads, railroads, airports, and water bodies, wetlands, floodplains, parkland, known fault lines or other environmentally sensitive areas;6.	A description of the potential site, including ownership, current activities, access control system, hazardous materials handling experience, mercury handling experience, current tenants, existing permits, previous regulatory compliance problems, and existing environmental contamination; and 7.	A description of the potential storage building, if pre-existing, including date and type of construction, floor condition, any special features that provide protection against leaks and external environmental hazards, fire suppression system, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, access control system, current activities and materials in storage, current tenants, and existing environmental contamination.
If available, Expressions of Interest should also identify equipment, materials, and labor required to upgrade or construct the potential facility to accept elemental mercury for long-term management and storage, as well as any environmental, health and safety approvals that will be required by Federal, state or local law.
V.  FORMAT
The length of the Expression of Interest should be no more than 20 pages using 12-point font.  Although each respondent may determine how best to organize the Expression of Interest, DOE recommends the following format: Section 1 -- Summary; and Section 2 -- Description of Location with specific reference to the items requested by DOE above. 
DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate.  An interested party should avoid including any business confidential and/or proprietary information in its Expression of Interest.  However, if an interested party must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked accordingly, and the interested party must provide sufficient justification as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary.  DOE will review said information and handle it in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. ? 552) and all applicable Federal law.  
This Request for Expressions of Interest is not a formal solicitation requesting proposals and does not represent a commitment by DOE to award a contract.  This Request for Expressions of Interest does not confer any commitment or obligation from DOE.  Under no circumstances does this Request for Expressions of Interest seek to award a contract for services under the Federal Acquisition Regulations or a financial assistance agreement under Part 600 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  
DOE does not intend to formally respond to information submitted in response to this Request for Expressions of Interest.  
The cost for the preparation and submittal of a response to the Request for Expressions of Interest is the sole responsibility of the interested party.  
VI.  SUBMISSION DEADLINE
Commercial entities wishing to make an Expression of Interest should do so in writing no later than 30 days from the date this notice is published.  Please submit hard copies of Expression of Interest to Mr. David Levenstein, Mail Stop: EM-11/Cloverleaf 2128, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC  20585.

Under this Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract, the Contractor shall provide the items of work required in separate Task Orders to remove and/or close physical safety hazards and openings associated with Abandoned Mine Lands (AML). Nothing in this contract calls for work associated with hazardous substances (as defined by 49 CFR 105.5 (b)) or under the authority of the Comprehensive Response Compensation Liabilities Act (CERCLA) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to PerkinElmer Health, 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, Connecticut 06484-4750 to procure maintenance and repair for a PerkinElmer Viewlux plate readers.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The mission of the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. NCGC optimizes biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; performs automated high-throughput screening (HTS); and performs chemistry optimization on confirmed hits to produce chemical probes for dissemination to the research community.  

This requested emergency repair order is required in order to repair one of the four Perkin Elmer Viewlux plate readers that are currently in use by our biology and automation groups.  This broken instrument is essential to the ongoing NCGC high throughput screening process and is currently used within with our Kalypsys Robotic system; the instrument is affixed to the rest of the robotic platform, which makes it extremely expensive and disruptive to remove for offsite repair.  This broken reader is causing a log jam of planned screening campaigns that have been assigned to our biology group by our Molecular Libraries funders.  Any additional down time will seriously affect lab work that has been validated months ago but is in danger of being ruined as these reagents and compounds do not have a unlimited time line for the proper analyzing on our robotic systems and this equipment has been broken for almost 3 months now.  The equipment repair is needed immediately to get the systems up and running.  These machines are used in conjunction with other high throughput systems that enables NCGC to screen 1536 well plates being analyzed against numerous chemical assays.  These ViewLux units are an ultra high throughput microplate imager for high sensitivity and fast measurement of light from fluorescence polarization (FP), fluorescence intensity, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF), luminescence and absorbance assays. Using 1536-well plates and, for example, fluorescence intensity, this equipment can allow throughputs in excess of 200,000 samples per hour under continuous operation.  This repair must be done by a licensed PerkinElmer Technician and no other vendors are acceptable. 

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic an Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, with size standard of $7.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-48 (January 31, 2011). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by February 22, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement,  referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-108-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.  Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to NanoTemper Technologies, Amalienstr.54, Munchen Bayern 80799, DEU to procure a Monolith NT.115 Instrument/ Microscale Thermophoresis (MST).

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The mission of the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. The Assay Development and Screening Technology (ADST) Laboratory, part of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), is requesting a NanoTemper Monolith instrument. This instrument is needed to handle the existing protocols of cell-based assays established by the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), a branch of the NCTT. The implementation of existing technology and protocols will ensure consistency and accuracy between all laboratories under the NCTT. 

The ADST Laboratory is working to develop novel assays as well as to apply existing assays to a spectrum of rare and neglected diseases under the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND) initiative.  This development of target specific cell based assays for rare and neglected diseases must also remain compatible with the automated robotic qHTS facility at the NCGC (NIH Chemical Genomic Center) to insure the efficient and accurate transfer of assays between laboratories.

NanoTemper.Monolith NT.115 Instrument Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) enable real-time, immobilization free analysis of biomolecules providing information on the affinity, stoichiometry, enzyme kinetics, and aggregation properties of biomolecules in buffers and complex biological liquids including blood serum and cell lysate. Equipped with the standard sample tray, it can process automatically up to 16 samples per run., 3 models of the Monolith NT.115 instrument are offered, which differ in the excitation/detection spectrum to detect blue, green and/or red fluorescent dyes.  Microscale Thermophoresis can monitor the binding of single ions (40Da) or small molecules (300Da) to a target as well as the binding of ribosomes (2.5MDa).  This instrument is also easy to handle and allows to measure the binding of biomolecules as well as the activity of enzymes.  

Microscale Thermophoresis monitors binding and biochemical activity of biomolecules under close-to-native conditions:

  immobilization-free; 
  In a solution of choice, ranging from standard and proprietary buffers to complex bioliquids including blood serum or cell lysates; and,
  at a temperature of choice. 
 
The capillary format is easy to handle and offers maximum flexibility in the experiment scale. The sample tray format allows to process automatically up to 16 capillaries (e.g. for a detailed KD-analysis), or alternatively to perform smaller pilot experiments or end point measurements involving 2-3 capillaries only. Microscale Thermophoresis requires approximately 100fold less sample material compared to standard technologies. Capillary volume: 3-5 l. 1-100 nM of the labeled compound.  The Monolith NT.115 instrument is supported by a software for data acquisition and analysis.

Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) technology uses a fluorescence microscope equipped with a dichroic mirror that couples a IR-Laser into the path of fluorescence light. The heating laser is focused with the same objective used for fluorescence detection. This enables a precise local heating (1-6 K) of the glass capillary and simultaneously to observe and measure local changes of fluorescence intensity due to the motion of labeled molecules in the glass capillaries. Fluorescently labeled molecules or particles are initially distributed evenly and diffuse freely in solution. By switching on the IR-Laser, the molecules experience a thermophoretic force in the temperature gradient and typically move out of the heated spot. In the steady state, this molecule flow is counterbalanced by ordinary mass diffusion. After turning off the laser, the particles diffuse back towards a homogeneous distribution. The following stages are recorded for each sample: fluorescence signal before turning the IR laser on, fast temperature-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity of the analyzed molecules, thermophoresis and back diffusion after switching the laser off.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 333314, Optical Instrument and Lens Manufacturing, with size standard of 500 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-48 (January 31, 2011).

Electrolyte status offers physiologic insight into the metabolic health of individuals. The quantification of 24-hour urinary electrolytes provides more information regarding the total physiologic balance of electrolyte metabolism within the individual. Urinary electrolytes offer novel insight into renal and metabolic heath, and may help identify individuals at risk for vascular disease risk factors before the development of overt clinical disease. This project will be implemented with the Litholink Company.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:<br />a. The Contractor shall provide electrolyte assay services to measure a panel of urinary electrolytes in 510 urine samples, and all NHLBI samples are to be processed at the contractor's location. <br />b. The Contractor is required to provide high quality assay results with CVs generally less than 10%<br />c. Quality control measures shall be applied by the contractor and assay results will be accompanied by quality control information reflecting intra- and inter-assay CVs.<br />d. The contractor shall specify any special packaging, marking, or shipping instructions for sample shipment<br />e. The contractor is required to identified each urine sample received by using the identifiers provided by NHLBI<br />f. The contractor shall aliquot off a separate tubule of urine for each participant, totaling 10 cc and shall be frozen at -80 degrees C.<br />g. The contractor is to include a flier created by the Framingham Heart Study n the 24-hour urine kits<br />h. The contractor is responsible for sending the required urinary kits with detailed instructions (for both test completion and return mail) to each participant in the study</p>
<p><br />Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:<br />a. Assay results will be returned by Contractor to NHLBI in a standard format in a nonproprietary database in which each analyte is identified by a standard name <br />b. Return of assay results by the Contractor will be accompanied by summary quality control measures for each analyte<br />c. Assay results will be returned to NHLBI within 10 business days of receipt of urine samples</p>
<p>Program Management and Control Requirements:<br />No special management or control systems are required under this contract</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities:<br />The government (NHLBI Framingham Heart Study Participants) will provide to the Contractor urine in tube via mail per the instructions in the urinary kits received by each participant from the Contractor. The study participants will have 3 business days to return the urine samples to the Contractor via mail according to the instructions specified by the Contractor. In addition, the Government will provide a list of identifiers for urine samples</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance shall be from March 15, 2011 -September 30, 2011 not to exceed six months.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the results while pursuing the study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators are expanding their research into other areas such as the role of metabolic risk factors in the pathogenesis of CVD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important risk factor for CVD and an important public health problem. The most severe stage of CKD, dialysis or transplantation, affects over 500,000 patients in the United States. Earlier stages of CKD are common, affecting 13% of adults in the United States, and 16 million individuals have reduced kidney function (CKD stages 3-5). In addition to increasing the risk for end-stage renal disease and a range of complications including anemia and bone disease, CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>Electrolyte status offers physiologic insight into the metabolic health of individuals. We have shown that genome-wide association of serum magnesium,10 calcium,11 phosphorous, and uric acid can identify many important transporters in the kidney associated with maintaining electrolyte balance. However, serum electrolytes are an imperfect measure of electrolyte metabolism, as many analytes are maintained within narrow, physiologic ranges in the serum. Thus, the quantification of 24-hour urinary electrolytes may provide more information regarding the total physiologic balance of electrolyte metabolism within the individual. Urinary electrolyte status has already been shown to be associated with body mass index, hypertension, and kidney stones. Urinary creatinine obtained from 24-hour urines are a good measure of total body lean mass and a strong predictor of mortality. Despite this, there has been relatively little exploration of 24-hour urine data in large population-based studies. This project involves the contractor performing the 24-hr urine assessment in the first year of the Offspring 9 and Omni exam 4 exams. This project involves the contractor performing the 24-hour urine collection and quantification on 510 individuals, and promptly returning the data within 30 days to the Framingham Heart Study, located at 73 Mt. Wayte Avenue, Framingham, MA. 01702.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis the continuation of support for the Neuro-QOL contract with the Northwestern University for "Neuro-QOL: Interim Sustainability and Training."
<p>The primary continuing goals of the contract are to design and develop a web-based platform that will allow researchers or clinicians to create study-specific web-based data collection pages; will include all Neuro-QOL short forms as well as instruments that include Computer Adaptive Testing for administration to research participants; will provide for scoring and exporting of data; and will provide technical support and consultation to researchers on the use of Neuro-QOL instruments, including data collection and data export functions. In addition, the contractor will be required to conduct 2 to 3 training sessions/workshops to introduce researchers to the development, methodology, and use of Neuro-QOL, provide education on IRT, CAT, and item bank construction, and train investigators in the use of the web-based Neuro-QOL platform in their research. Training sessions may be conducted locally or in conjunction with existing scientific meetings in order to encourage participation. We anticipate that this will be a one-year undertaking to complete all requirements.<br />Over the initial 6 year contract, the Northwestern University, (under a subcontract to NorthShore University HealthCare Research Institute), developed, tested, and completed initial validation of the required instruments. Given that Northwestern University has performed all the work in development of the Neuro-QOL deliverable, there is no reasonable alternative but to award a sole-source acquisition of this interim service. Although there may be other potential sources that would have the technical ability to serve this function, they would not be able to provide the scientific and technical expertise specific to this requirement, including providing consultation and training on the development, implementation, and interpretation of the Neuro-QOL instruments. The NINDS believes that the Northwestern University is the only source available with the knowledge and capability to develop the interim web-based platform and provide the requisite training and consultation to support access, implementation, and maintenance of the Neuro-QOL.</p>
<p>The specific approach to long-term sustainability of Neuro-QOL will be determined by NINDS over the next year. Until full implementation of a future plan is accomplished, it is essential to make Neuro-QOL available to the research community for two primary reasons: 1) to avoid protracted delay in incorporation of the Neuro-QOL measures into applicable clinical research projects, and 2) to provide a period of time for interested potential sources to have an opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of the structure of the Neuro-QOL platform so they may participant in a possible future competition for funding to maintain Neuro-QOL should the government opt to pursue such competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations that believe they have the qualifications and capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of staffing, facilities, and methodologies currently in place to the Contracting Officer at the above address within 45 days from the date of this announcement.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, quotation or capability statement which shall be considered by the NINDS. The determination by the Government not to compete the new contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority: 45 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This is not a formal solicitation or an announcement that a Request for Proposals (RFP) is available.</p>

The CORE software suite enables model-based Systems Engineering.  The models are used to create, specify, communicate, select and test system and design concepts during the developmental phase of our programs.  The CORE system will be used to enable systems engineers to derive requirements, conduct functional analysis, allocate functions to hardware, track constraints, track issues, manage risks, and prepare system specification and interface specification in an integrated, concurrent, logical and consistent manner.   

The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1.  The Government conducted a review of the various commercial products in Systems Engineering, and it was determined that CORE was the only software that could meet the dual requirements of being able to produce an integrated model of the system being developed and being able to automatically generate a system specification.  As such, CORE Enterprise Client is mission critical to the efficient and effective performance of NAVAIR Systems Engineers in their execution of their duties.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to award a sole source purchase order for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) under the authority of FAR part 13.5 to GfK Kynetec (GfK) for Agricultural Pesticide Usage Data.
The EPA requires a 12-month subscription to the 2009 & 2010 GfK Kynetec AgroTrak which includes the following:  a.) historical years database access (1998-2010); b.) 10- web user licenses; and c.) all crops/all pesticide types/database access.  The Period of Performance will be from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012.  
Before the EPA takes regulatory actions on pesticides, studies are conducted on human health, environmental, economic and social impacts as required by FIFRA 92-515, as amended.  In order to adequately evaluate health, environmental, social and economic aspects of the use of substitutes for pesticides, a database is needed which contains accurate, current usage data for agricultural pesticides by chemical active ingredient, end-use product, pesticide type, and crop protected.  The type of usage data needed includes the following: total and base acres treated, total pounds applied, the number of farms treated, the time of application, the stage of the pest infestation, pesticide prices and expenditures, the rate of application, target pest and pest complex, the method of application, and other related factors, by state or designated region.
This purchase will make available to EPA pesticide market survey data and reports for 1998-2010 and the associated Percent Crop Treated files, which will serve as a critical input in conducting economic and related analyses of pesticide regulatory matters.  These data are for internal use within the EPA, not for release to nonsubscribers or the general public without prior permission of the contractor.  The market studies should provide current data for herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and other pesticides used on various agricultural crops or sites.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  It has been determined that GfK is the only source for this data that meets the Government?s requirements.  No other source has been located which can provide as robust data that is required.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirement as stated herein, may submit its capability by 12:00 PM on Wednesday, February 23, 2011, which may be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete the purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Abbie Jemmott at Jemmott.Abbie@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:pamela.j.shirley@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Jacksonville</a>
<DESC>The S-69 Weir in Okeechobee and Highlands Counties, Florida is part of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project (KRR). The Project Description for the S-69 Weir includes the following:  design and construction of a steel sheet pile U-shaped Weir, earthen tie-back levees, concrete apron /access road, levee erosion armoring, channel backfill, site grading and incidental related work that will be depicted on preliminary drawings.  The S-69 U-Shaped Weir Project will backfill the C-38 canal just above the CSX Railroad Bridge in order to redirect flow into the historic Kissimmee River channel and rehydrate the upstream floodplain. Because the historic river channel has a much lower flow capacity than the C-38 canal, a passive water control structure will be needed in order to alleviate flooding onto lands outside the Kissimmee River boundaries that are not owned by the South Florida Water Management District. This control structure will be constructed at the downstream terminus of the C-38 backfill and will be a steel sheet pile weir which will be roughly 3'-0" above the existing local grade elevation. During storm events, the weir will spill floodwater into the remaining portion of the C-38 canal downstream of the weir.   The weir has been located at a safe distance upstream of the existing CSX Railroad Bridge in order to avoid potential scour of its bridge piers. In order to close the system and create the flood plain, earth tie-back levees will be provided between the downstream ends of the weir and the railroad embankment. A 14' wide unpaved road will be constructed along the crest of the levees on both banks of the river for maintenance egress. The access roads above the levees will be connected by a 16' wide concrete apron on the downstream side of the weir that will serve as both a roadway and erosion control.<BR><BR>Design Requirements:  The US Army Corps of Engineers has performed preliminary design of the weir in order to locate the structures and permit the project. The Contractor will need to complete the design of the weir and construct the project based on this design. The remaining design work includes, generating civil plans of the levees and earthwork, performing stability, seepage, and soil bearing analysis of the levees, design of erosion armoring, design of the steel sheet pile weir, design of the maintenance roadway, and mitigating settlement for the portion of the weir crossing the backfilled canal. All construction documents shall be signed sealed by professional engineers registered in the State of Florida.  The contractors engineers will need to participate in the intermediate and final reviews and address all comments prior to the contractor receiving notice to proceed with construction.  <BR><BR>Construction Requirements:  The scope of work includes backfilling the C-38 canal by degrading spoil mounds remaining from the canal excavation. These mounds are located on the west bank of the C-38 canal. The weir will be approximately 1900 linear feet of cantilevered steel sheet pile retaining wall with a 16 foot wide concrete apron/maintenance road on its downstream face. In order to provide uniform circulation and flow of water over the weir, shallow equalization channels will be excavated immediately upstream of the east and west legs of the weir. Roughly 1000 linear feet of earthen levees will be provided between the ends of the weir and the CSX railroad embankment on each bank in order to close the system and create the flood plain. The transition between the weir and levees will require armoring in order to prevent local erosion. Access roads will be constructed above the levees with ramps transitioning to adjacent grade. Upstream and downstream safety barriers will also be in the scope of work.  <BR><BR>PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS:  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  A two phase design build process will be utilized.  Phase 1 Proposals will be evaluated on Specialized Experience, Past Performance, and Organizational and Technical Approach.  NOTE:  THE SUBMISSION OF PRICING INFORMATION WILL NOT BE REQUIRED IN PHASE 1 PROPOSALS.  A maximum of 5 of the most highly rated Phase 1 offerors will be requested to submit Phase 2 proposals.  Phase 2 Proposals will be evaluated on Design Technical, Performance Capability, and Price.   Performance period is approximately 840 days, including both design and construction.  Magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Phase 1 Solicitation will be issued on or about 10 March 2011 and will close on or about 12 April 2011.  THIS ACQUISITION IS A HUBZONE SET ASIDE.  ALL RESPONSIBLE HUBZONE OFFERORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time.
<p>The Information Technology Branch (ASC/PKEI), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is conducting market research to determine potential sources for a potential Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle to develop learning initiatives.</p>
<p>The Air Force Institute of Technology School of Systems and Logistics (AFIT/LS) has a need to develop a series of computer-based learning initiatives (e.g. courses). Courses may include, but are not limited to, computer-based (CBT), web-based (e-learning), video-based and blended (combined) and even potentially live/classroom-based courses. Development services include the creation of presentation materials (web based, videos, audio, or other media). Contractors will be encouraged to propose new leading edge technologies. AFIT/LS require 8 to 12 courses to be developed annually, although the actual number may vary. Each course's length, content and interactivity is expected to vary as well. The courses shall be designed for adult learners and cover a host of current topics needed for professionals in the weapons systems acquisition and sustainment career fields. Development of each course will be based on a series of experiences and challenges, combined with education and training opportunities that enable the learners to grow and succeed professionally as well as meet Air Force needs. A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to this announcement.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates awarding a multiple-award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The anticipated period of performance is 1 Jan 2012 through 31 Dec 2014.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate the size of their business and, where applicable, their small business status on the attached Capabilities Matrix.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) for the Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) Program
<SOLNBR>SMC-11-41
<RESPDATE>032111
<ARCHDATE>04252011
<CONTACT>Don Ruffin, Program Manager, Phone 310.653.3905, Email don.ruffin@us.af.mil - Lorraine Lewis-Wilson, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-0920, Email lorraine.lewis-wilson@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>16a. Description:
<p>The Defense Weather Systems Directorate (DWSD) Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) program office, on behalf of the United States Air Force, is seeking information from companies who could provide a production capability of seven (7) space-based Radio Frequency (RF) beacons flight articles and one (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) for remote sensing of ionospheric scintillation and line-of-sight Total Electron Content (TEC), and the associated payload to space vehicle integration and test support, and an option for commercially priced controlled storage facilities needed for the program. The RF beacon flight article is defined as a standard RF beacon. The addition of the language "flight article" should not imply that we are requesting anything other than the standard RF beacon.</p>
<p>Measurements of signals transmitted by a RF beacon flight article can be used to measure ionospheric properties such as the TEC along the signal propagation path, amplitude and phase scintillation indices at the transmitted frequencies. The TEC observations can be ingested into global assimilative models to improve ionospheric specification, and the scintillation observations can be used to estimate ionosphere-induced degradation of communication/navigation signals across the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>16b. Purpose:</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes. The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on existing technologies, or existing technologies with possible minor modifications that can be used to meet the sensing capabilities described in paragraph 16d, incorporating the listed Government assumptions. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in estimated cost and schedule information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 16d.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI# SMC-11-41 is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. We are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer from any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

<p>16d. Sensing Capability Information Sought:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information that provides an approach/information concerning the design and manufacturing of the RF beacon flight articles that would enable transmissions in the following frequency bands:</p>
<p>&bull; Coherent continuous wave UHF (e.g., 400 MHz) signal<br />&bull; Coherent continuous wave L-band (e.g., 1067 MHz) signal<br />&bull; Coherent continuous wave S-band (&gt;2 GHz) signal</p>
<p>The Government is also interested in responses containing approaches/ideas/designs that might provide additional value that could include modulation of the continuous wave signals.</p>
<p>To mitigate interference issues with a potentially co-manifested radio occultation sensor, the L-band frequency should be selected to avoid the Global Navigation Satellite Signal (GNSS) bands (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS) and particular care should be taken in the instrument design to ensure that no spurious emissions in the GNSS bands exist. While this RFI is focused on a space-based transmitter, the Government understands that the capabilities of potential ground receivers are a factor in the RF beacon flight article design. Responses to this RFI should include a discussion of the assumptions made relative to the ground-based component of the transmitter-receiver system. Furthermore, the implications of any proposed waveforms on the complexity of the ground-based receiver systems required to exploit the transmitted signals should be discussed.</p>
<p>The Government is requesting responses from respondents with established manufacturing processes and equipment for producing the desired RF beacon flight articles. The Government is seeking responses that demonstrate technology and design maturity along with the associated manufacturing readiness. The respondent should provide Level II cost and delivery schedule estimates by fiscal year as well as their assumptions associated with providing:</p>
<p>&bull; Seven (7) RF beacon flight articles<br />&bull; One (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU)<br />&bull; One (1) power and data interface simulator<br />&bull; Ground Support Equipment (GSE)<br />&bull; Space vehicle integration and test support<br />&bull; Controlled environment storage option - Priced by month<br />&bull; Packaging and shipping containers <br />&bull; Launch and early operations anomaly support</p>
<p>The required funding profile across the fiscal years involved to meet the program schedule should be provided.</p>
<p>The following Government assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation:</p>
<p>1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level and responders may also include figures from various confidence levels, with appropriate justification;<br />2. Solutions will be low risk by using high TRL components (i.e. minimum of TRL 6), the Government is willing to assess lower TRL with appropriate justification;<br />3. No Government facilities or property will be provided;<br />4. Anticipated contract award during 4th quarter Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2012;<br />5. Sensor delivery dates: (a) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) 4th quarter GFY 2013; (b) First RF beacon flight article 1st quarter GFY 2014; (c) Remaining 6 RF beacon flight articles 2nd quarter GFY 2014;<br />6. Spacecraft integration/pre-launch support: through launch in 4th quarter GFY 2015;<br />7. Estimate storage option based on a monthly rate;<br />8. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level possible;<br />9. Program level costs will include Systems Engineering, Program Management, Design, Manufacturing, Integration, Assembly and Test support, etc;<br />10. For contract type recommendations see Section 5.</p>
<p>Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the Government is only seeking information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>In your approach/responses please include the following, as well:</p>
<p>&bull; Discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations<br />&bull; Information pertaining to utilization of small business subcontractor/s, if applicable.</p>
<p>16e. Desired Technical Goals:</p>
<p>The RF beacon flight article should have a reliability of 95% probability of success (Ps) for the 5-year mission life. The altitude of the spacecraft carrying the RF beacon flight article will be 840 km or less. The command interface to the host spacecraft will be RS422. Measurement goals for TEC and scintillation measurements are provided in the following bullets. Scintillation measurement goals apply at each of the RF beacon flight article frequencies.</p>

Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS".<BR><BR>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.

<DESC>Market Research for the USMC Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) Acquisition Program: Request for Information. <BR><BR>The requesting contracting command is:<BR>U.S. Army Contracting Command - Warren<BR>6501 E. 11 Mile Road<BR>ATTN:  CCTA-AHXB (MS 501)<BR>Warren, MI 48397-5000<BR><BR>1.	Message to Industry:  The Marine Corps will be taking a collaborative approach with industry in order to produce a more affordable amphibious capability.  Interested partners should look at the Marine Corps amphibious capability requirements for an Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV), Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC), and Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) legacy upgrades as discussed in this and the other amphibious RFIs as a Family of Systems.  The Marine Corps would like to see industry focus on affordability by designing / proposing solutions that will reduce the operational and support costs over the life cycle and consider such things as commonality, modularity of proposed solutions and interoperability among System of Systems.  These solutions should take into consideration emerging technologies and provide for growth over the next 15 years.  Additionally, the Marine Corps is interested in hearing from industry strategies they would use to lower their procurement costs for their proposed solutions.  <BR><BR>2.	Request for Information:  The Marine Corps is exploring streamlined methodologies and reviewing the candidate maturity levels available to support acceleration of the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) program.  The MPC will complement the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) and its replacement within the Assault Amphibian (AA) Battalion by providing a modern armored personnel carrier capability and capacity to the Ground Combat Element of the Marine Air Ground Task Force.  <BR><BR>3.	Reference and Appendices:  The annex A for the MPC is attached to this notice.  Further information is contained on a Classified Annex that must be requested specifically by the contractor from either the Point of Contact (POC) or the Procurement Contracting Officer listed at the end of this notice.  The contractor will be required to have the proper security clearance to obtain access to the Classified Annex.<BR><BR>4.	Proprietary Information:  The United States Government (USG) acknowledges its obligations under Federal Acquisition Regulation (18 U.S.C 1905) to protect confidential information provided to the Government.  Pursuant to this statute, the USG is willing to accept any trade secrets or proprietary restrictions placed upon qualifying data forwarded in response to this RFI and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following:<BR> 	Qualifying data must be clearly marked PROPRIETARY and be accompanied by an explanatory text so that the Government is clearly notified as to exactly what data so qualifies. <BR> 	Mark only data that is truly confidential.<BR> 	Do not mark data that is already in the public domain or is already in the possession of the USG or third parties on an unclassified basis.<BR> 	Proprietary data transmitted electronically must have the PROPRIETARY legend on both the cover and the transmittal e-mail, as well as at the beginning of the file.  <BR>Proprietary information contained within the correspondence shall use the legends:  "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<BR><BR>5.	Disclaimer:  The USG is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Nor is the Government obligated to like data in possession of third parties or for data which is afterwards placed in the public domain by the contractor or by third parties through no fault of the USG.  Should the USG need to reproduce the protected data for distribution purposes between Government offices, all Government personnel provided with protected information will, prior to receiving copies of such information, sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement, which alerts personnel of the confidential nature of the information being provided, as well as the seriousness of the Government's obligations to protect such information.<BR><BR>6.	Clarification of this Action:  The objective of this RFI is to assess industry's ability to provide a materiel solution within an accelerated acquisition schedule while meeting the current system requirements at an affordable cost.  The Marine Corps has built and tested a technology demonstrator in order to develop, refine, and validate requirements and costs.  Work with the demonstrator has affirmed the Service decision to pursue the MPC requirement set as an advanced generation 8x8 armored personnel carrier. The USMC wants to determine the technical and manufacturing maturity of candidate systems that provide the capabilities desired in the MPC.  <BR><BR>The Marine Corps is planning an aggressive, competitive acquisition approach with the intent to field an MPC fleet as rapidly as possible. With this in mind, the Army Contracting Command is conducting a Request For Information (RFI) on behalf of the Program Executive Office Land Systems (PEO LS) and USMC Combat Development and Integration (CD&I) to obtain industry input to support an accelerated acquisition of the fleet. It is desired that respondents identify those mature materiel solutions that meet the MPC capabilities, as well as the cost and timeframe for providing those solutions. Please include the following information in your response:  <BR><BR>(1)	Assessment of Baseline Solution: The attached Annex A is the current MPC requirement list. For this RFI, the Baseline MPC is defined as the system as it could be currently produced. The desired MPC is defined as the system that best meets the requirements as presented in Annex A. Respondents are requested to assess their Baseline MPC candidate(s) against the Annex A requirements and present a description of how the candidate(s) meets or does not meet each of the tiered requirements. For each requirement, please present an assessment of the maturity of the proposed solution.  Please also present a baseline program schedule to include the following milestones: <BR>A.)	The date (After Receipt of Order (ARO)) when four of the Baseline MPC personnel variants could be delivered for competitive testing.  <BR>B.)	The date (ARO) when the first initial production of Baseline MPC personnel variants could be delivered for Production Verification Testing (PVT). <BR>C.)	The date (ARO) when the first 72 Baseline MPC vehicles and associated logistics products could be delivered for fielding. <BR><BR>For the purpose of this RFI, assume that the start date is 1 October 2011. Please provide a ROM estimate of the program costs to attain each milestone. In addition, please provide the unit cost estimate for the Baseline MPC with a recommended delivery schedule which will yield the most favorable unit cost.<BR><BR>(2) Approach for Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I): For each of the tiered requirements that the candidate system(s) fails to meet, describe if and how that requirement can be obtained to achieve the Desired MPC system.  Please present the development time line to attain each additional requirement, as well as a ROM for the cost of that effort and the respective unit cost increase for each upgrade. Please provide the associated timing for the fielding of each P3I.<BR><BR>(3) Growth Potential: The USMC MPC fleet once fielded will have an expected service life of at least 25 years.  Respondents are requested to describe where design margin exists in the Baseline MPC to allow specific parameters, such as weight and protection levels to increase and assess the impact on performance<BR><BR>(4) Identification of affordability trade space:  Respondents are requested to identify those requirements where additional trade space can affect the affordability of both the baseline or Desired MPC systems. This is to include suggesting both increased trade space within a specific requirement as well as suggested changes to the production schedule.<BR><BR>(5) ROM Cost estimates:  Respondents are requested to present their cost estimate in FY11 dollars.<BR>Point(s) of Contact:  Information pertaining to the performance specifications or for access to the Classified Annex will be provided separately by request to the Point of Contract listed below.   <BR><BR>Michael P.

<SUBJECT>Microsimulation Support for Tax, Transfer and Health Insurance
<SOLNBR>HHS-OS-ASPE-SBSS-11-001
<RESPDATE>030411
<CONTACT>Camille M. Timmerman, Contract Specialist, Phone 301.443.6851, Email camille.timmerman@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong>Background:</strong>The Transfer Income Model (TRIM) is a comprehensive microsimulation model developed and maintained by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Department of Health and Human Services (ASPE/HHS). TRIM simulates the major governmental tax, transfer, and health programs that affect the U.S. population and can produce results at the individual, family, state and national levels. TRIM is used to understand the potential outcomes of changes such as welfare, tax and national health insurance reforms. TRIM is used to provide policy advice and develop policy recommendations for the Administration, Secretary and other senior level officials on alternatives to existing tax and transfer programs.
<p>In the late 1960s under sponsorship of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, TRIM was designed and developed. In the early 1970s, TRIM2, a totally reprogrammed mainframe version of this system, was produced. Starting in 1995, ASPE/HHS moved TRIM from the mainframe computer to a client/server system. The latest version, TRIM3, grounds the model on a computation platform that takes advantage of advances in information technology. TRIM3 allows registered users to conduct simulations and share results over the Internet from their personal computers i.e. clients. The work of running the simulations and storing large databases is handled by more powerful computers, i.e. servers that are shared by many users.</p>
<p>TRIM3 calculates eligibility and enrollment (participation) for complex, large-scale government tax, transfer, and health programs at the individual, family, state and national levels. It can model the eligibility, enrollment, income and poverty effects (including their interactions), as seen in Table 1, of policy changes in fifteen major government tax, transfer, and health programs for the entire non-institutional population of the United States. <br /><br />Table 1 - PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE MODELED BY TRIM3<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Cash and in-kind transfer programs<br /></span>. Supplemental Security Income<br />. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families/Aid to Families with Dependent Children<br />. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly the Food Stamp Program)<br />. Child Support<br />. Public Housing and subsidized housing programs<br />. Child Care<br />. Unemployment Insurance<br />. Women, Infant and Children<br />. Low Income Energy Assistance</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health insurance programs<br /></span>. Medicare<br />. Medicaid/CHIP<br />. Employer-sponsored health insurance</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tax Programs<br /></span>. Payroll taxes<br />. Federal income taxes (including EITC and health care credits)<br />. State Income taxes</p>
<p>TRIM3 operates on individual units rather than on aggregate data. Its input database contains records on a sample of persons, families, and households in the U.S. TRIM3 applies a set of rules to each individual record. When a simulation is processed, the calculations are performed for each unit (person, family, or household), the results are weighted to reflect the unit's frequency in the population and aggregated outcomes are produced. The generalized structure of TRIM3 permits multiple definitions of program filing units to be utilized. For many programs, changes can currently be modeled from 1993 forward. With additional conversion of historical TRIM data files from TRIM2 to TRIM3 format changes for many programs could be modeled from 1979 forward. TRIM3 also calculates results using current program rules and shows the effects of possible changes in these rules.</p>
<p>TRIM3 can be used in addressing a wide range of policy questions. It can be used in formulating possible changes in program rules resulting from new policies, examining the effects of such changes on the entire non-institutional population of the United States or a sub-population, and in comparing the results with current policy. It also provides a single source for detailed information on programs and their changes over time. TRIM3 can also be used to create data files for input into other applications, providing more detailed data than would otherwise be available.</p>
<p>TRIM3 offers key advantages relative to other kinds of models. It can be used in examining how changes in one program or policy will ripple through others. By operating at the unit level, TRIM3 is able to capture interactions among simulated programs and can tabulate results by a wide variety of socioeconomic variables. Since results are tabulated according to the actual rules of the simulated program, a virtually unlimited number of policy scenarios can be modeled simply by changing the rules of the simulated program. Additional advantages of TRIM3 are its modularity, parameterization, historical continuity, and web-interface access. TRIM3 system configuration and technical policies provide a secure and stable platform for simulation work. <br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong> The purpose of this contract is to obtain expert technical support services for performing the wide variety of complex tasks that are necessary in order to estimate the effects of altering government tax, transfer and health programs using the Transfer Income Model (TRIM) a complex microsimulation model owned by HHS. TRIM undergoes constant development and is currently updated annually to capture the latest changes in government tax and transfer programs. Among the major activities to be undertaken are: developing baselines providing information on current participation in government tax, transfer and health programs; producing estimates of the costs and caseload impacts that result from changes to existing and/or proposed government tax, transfer, and health programs; and, further development of TRIM3 to permit analysis of major new program alternatives. High priority activities and extremely short deadlines imposed by Secretarial, Administration, and Congressional requests make it necessary to supplement in-house capability.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong> The work under this contract is classified into six broad areas:<br /><br />(1) Providing for the basic maintenance of the model; <br />(2) Obtaining expert technical assistance in analyzing the costs and impacts of alternative proposals for modifying tax, transfer and health programs; <br />(3) Incorporating new data and program changes into the model to keep it up-to-date;<br />(4) Performing baseline simulations that augment the input data, correct for underreporting of transfer program income on survey files, and permit comparison of the status quo and proposed alternatives; <br />(5) Major upgrades and improvements to the model to reflect program changes and computer enhancements; and <br />(6) Continued documentation, including maintaining an up-to-date website and training.<br /><br /><strong>Anticipated period of performance:</strong> The period of performance will include one 12-month base period and three 12-month option periods.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement/information sought:</strong> Respondents must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement, which addresses the following:<br /><br />(1) Familiarity with and demonstrated knowledge of the programs identified in Table 1 above.<br /><br />(2) Demonstrated ability to provide a) professional staff with successful academic and/or professional work experiences in modeling and analyzing the programs identified in Table 1 above; b) programming staff with work experiences in maintaining and furthering developing client-server computing systems including the publicly available website; c) work experiences with using microdata files such as the Current Population Survey and augmenting these files through statistical matching and other analytic techniques and d) the ability to direct and manage projects of this magnitude including solid fiscal management. <br /><br />(3) Demonstrated ability to provide staff with the skill set described in Item 2 above on a less than full time basis.<br /><br />(4)&nbsp;Demonstrated experience and expertise in providing quick turn-around analysis that produces high quality reports in response to high priority activities and extremely short deadlines imposed by Secretarial, Administration, and Congressional requests. Turn around requests can be as short as one work day. <br /><br />(5) Demonstration of ability to manage large projects that require the utilization of a wide range of staff on multiple tasks simultaneously. <br /><br /><br />Respondents must include their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code. Include technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.<br /><br />Submissions should be sent electronically to Ms. Camille Timmerman, Contract Specialist, at camille.timmerman@psc.hhs.gov. Responses must be double-spaced and single-sided on 8.5" x 11" plain white paper, with 1" margins on all side, using a standard font no smaller than 12 point. The response must be sequentially numbered, beginning on the first page after the table of contents. <br /><br />Responses are due by 5:00PM EST on March 4, 2011. Responses will not be accepted after the due date. <br /><br /><strong>Disclaimer and Important Notes:</strong>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate.

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE

1. GENERAL 

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. 

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. 

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 


3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE 

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. 

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. 

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. 

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. 

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. 




4. INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT 

a.Information systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities shall comply with all VA directives developed in accordance with FISMA, HIPAA, NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems. This includes standards for the protection of electronic PHI, outlined in 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C, information and system security categorization level designations in accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200 with implementation of all baseline security controls commensurate with the FIPS 199 system security categorization (reference Appendix D of VA Handbook 6500, VA Information Security Program). During the development cycle a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must be completed, provided to the COTR, and approved by the VA Privacy Service in accordance with Directive 6507, VA Privacy Impact Assessment. 

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall certify to the COTR that applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the VA Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), and the common security configuration guidelines provided by NIST or the VA. This includes Internet Explorer 7 configured to operate on Windows XP and Vista (in Protected Mode on Vista) and future versions, as required. 

c. The standard installation, operation, maintenance, updating, and patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the VA approved and FDCC configuration. Information technology staff must also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default "program files" directory and silently install and uninstall. 

d. Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges. 

e. The security controls must be designed, developed, approved by VA, and implemented in accordance with the provisions of VA security system development life cycle as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems, VA Handbook 6500, Information Security Program and VA Handbook 6500.5, Incorporating Security and Privacy in System Development Lifecycle. 

f. The contractor/subcontractor is required to design, develop, or operate a System of Records Notice (SOR) on individuals to accomplish an agency function subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, (as amended), Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and applicable agency regulations. Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of criminal and civil penalties. 

g. The contractor/subcontractor agrees to: 

   (1) Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies: 

(a)	The Systems of Records (SOR); and 

       (b) The design, development, or operation work that the contractor/subcontractor is to perform; 

   (2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and 

    
(3) Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph (3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a SOR. 

h. In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the contractor/subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency. 

  (1) "Operation of a System of Records" means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records. 

  (2) "Record" means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and contains the person's name, or identifying number, symbol, or any other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph. 

  (3) "System of Records" means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. 

i. The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as "Systems"), throughout the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods. This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware. The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems. 






5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE 

a. For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerablity scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation. 

b. Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII. 

c. Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks. 

d. The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with 
contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary. 

e. The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost. 

f. VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor-owned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA-approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE. 

g. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract. 

h. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are: 

(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive; 

(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or 

(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase. 

(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then; 

(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and 

(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract.

(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation. 



6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any 
											

Law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or othercompensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 




7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH 

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA 
must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); 

(2) Description of the event, including: 

(a) date of occurrence; 
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code; (3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; 
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; 
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; 
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 					


(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 

(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 

d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 

(1)Notification; 

(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; 

(3) Data breach analysis; 

(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 

(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and 

(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. 


8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING 

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 

9. TRAINING

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: 
												


VA HANDBOOK 6500.6							

(1)Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior.

(2) Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and 

b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 

c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for propulsion system maintenance, technical and logistic support and training for Ulstein Model 1350H Marine Thruster Z-Drives in Coast Guard stock and installed aboard 175' WLM Keeper class buoy tenders. (This Notice reiterates a Coast Guard requirement original published in HSCG40-10-R-WLMZD. Capability statements provided in response to the earlier Notice will be reviewed again as part of SFLC's market research for this requirement.)
<p>The Coast Guard's Surface Forces Logistics Command (SFLC), Icebreaker, Buoy and Construction Tender product line (IBCT), is interested in determining what sources are able to provide such maintenance, support and training.</p>
<p>General specifications of the units to be overhauled and equipment overview:</p>
<p>Model No.: 1350H<br />Rating: 745kw (999 HP) @ 1600 RPM<br />Ration (Viewed Input Hub Face): Clockwise-Starboard Unit; Counter-Clockwise Port Unit<br />Propeller Speed: 403 RPM<br />Dry Weight: 27,000 lbs</p>
<p>Note: here and hereafter in this notice, when reference is made to a Z-Drive, thruster or unit, it shall be considered to include the attached propeller and shipping skid, total weight approximately 56,000 lbs.</p>
<p>Total number of installed thrusters: 28 EA on 14 separate Keeper class buoy tenders.</p>
<p>Total number of spare thrusters in Coast Guard supply system: 4 EA</p>
<p>Location of Keeper class buoy tenders: 3 West Coast; 11 East Coast.</p>
<p>The Keeper class buoy tenders' main propulsion system consists of two (Port &amp; Starboard) through-hull, steerable Ulstein Model 1350H Z-Drives. Though&nbsp; basically a commercial Ulstein model, those in the Coast Guard inventory were designed during vessel construction to be specifically integrated into the Keeper class vessel configuration. Consequently, the units in the Coast Guard inventory have some unique design features that do not appear in<br />commercial thrusters of that model.</p>
<p>OVERHAUL DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Each Z-Drive shall be overhauled in accordance with a detailed specification mandating use of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Standards, Processes, Procedures and OEM-certified new or requalified/rebuilt parts/assemblies. The overhaul will include the following sequential steps:</p>
<p>a. Performing a full equipment inventory to insure completeness of unit<br />b. Cleaning the Z-Drive in preparation for disassembly<br />c. Disassembling the Z-Drive to component level, performing further cleaning and NDT, measuring and recording dimensional attributes, propeller condition, validating configuration, assessing condition of beveled gear sets and submitting a detailed Pre-Overhaul Inspection Report that includes overhaul recommendations, labor/material/parts costs, and estimated overhaul completion interval.<br />d. Overhauling/replacing components/assemblies as authorized by the Coast Guard<br />e. Reassembling the Z-Drive and submit a Post Overhaul Inspection Report<br />f. Performing an acceptance Spin test and completing a final gear contact pattern inspection jointly with a Coast Guard QA representative<br />g. Preserving, packaging, packing, and marking the Z-drive in preparation for shipment</p>
<p>TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT:</p>
<p>a. As required, and both remotely or onsite, provide OEM engineering analysis and consultation for Z-Drive maintenance and casualty repair.<br />b. As required, provide OEM field engineering support to oversee installation of overhauled Z-Drives aboard Coast Guard buoy tenders.<br />c. Provide continuous stream of OEM-generated technical recommendations regarding upgrades, part substitutions, maintenance practices and processes. Notify the Coast Guard of long lead-time part concerns.<br />d. As required, provide OEM-certified new or requalified/rebuilt to SFLC IBCT or homeported or deployed buoy tenders.</p>
<p>TRAINING SUPPORT FOR COAST GUARD ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS:</p>
<p>a. As required, and both remotely and onsite, provide OEM-qualified maintenance, operational and diagnostic training to shore and vessel based Coast Guard units.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED QUANTITIES:</p>
<p>The Coast Guard projects a requirement to overhaul a total of six (06) Z-Drives each year consisting of three (03) port and three (03) starboard units. This estimate is based primarily on the increasing failure rate experienced due to the age and operating hours on the equipment.</p>
<p>The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support &amp; oversee installation of Z-Drives is three (3) per year. <br /><br />The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support engineering analysis and consultation for Z-Drive maintenance and casualty repair is three (3) per year.<br /><br />The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support training requirements is three (3) per year.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED OVERHAUL PERIOD FOR EACH Z-DRIVE:</p>
<p>The expected overhaul interval for each Z-Drive overhaul is approximately 4-6 months. This estimate is based on previous experience and presumes that required OEM parts will be readily available.</p>
<p>EXPECTED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>SFLC anticipates Z-Drive overhaul and technical support needs will be incorporated into a firm fixed-price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity delivery order contract with a base contract year and four (4) contract option years.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL AND LICENSING BARRIERS/LIMITS:</p>
<p>The Coast Guard was unable to obtain, and/or the systems manufacturers were unwilling to furnish, complete detailed technical &amp; engineering data specific to the Ulstein Model 1350H Z-Drives during the acquisition phase of the 175' WLM platform program. Consequently, critical dimensional and tolerance information remains proprietary to Rolls-Royce, the current OEM. This has precluded SFLC and its predecessor organization from promoting alternative overhaul sources or even developing organic repair capabilities within the fleet maintenance network. As such, the Coast Guard believes that only Rolls-Royce can satisfy this requirement. However, alternate sources believing they possess the necessary expertise, technical data, resources, and capabilities to meet the Coast Guard's specific Z-Drive overhaul and technical support requirements outlined above are encouraged to submit statements of capability for review/consideration.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF CAPABILITY FORMAT AND CONTENT:</p>
<p>Responses from both large and small businesses are considered at this time.</p>

<DESC>Amphibious Combat Vehicle 
Request for Information (RFI)
General Information:

Contracting Office Address: 
Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA, 22134-5010

Message to Industry:  The Marine Corps will be taking a collaborative approach with industry in order to produce a more affordable amphibious capability.  Interested partners should look at the Marine Corps amphibious requirements for an Amphibious Combat Vehicle, Marine Personnel Carrier and AAV legacy upgrades as discussed in this and the other amphibious RFIs as a Family of Systems.   The Marine Corps would like to see industry focus on affordability by designing/proposing solutions that will reduce the operational and support costs over the life cycle and consider such things as commonality, modularity of proposed solutions and interoperability among Systems of Systems.
  These solutions should take into consideration emerging technologies and provide for growth over the next 15 years. Additionally, the Marine Corps is interested in hearing from industry strategies they would use to lower their procurement costs for their proposed solutions.

Description:  Title 10, U.S. Code, directs the Marine Corps to develop equipment used by landing forces in amphibious operations.

The Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) fleet is aging.  Should the current AAV Family of Vehicles (FoV) not be replaced operations that assure access would become either single dimensional operations, relying entirely upon air assault of infantryman, or be required to use a mid-20th century means of surface transport that lacks needed capabilities such as firepower, autonomous ship to shore movement, ground mobility, and over the horizon range.
  The current AAV does not meet the needs of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) developed in response to the emerging threat environment.  Use of such equipment and tactics could result in unacceptable loss of life or mission failure.

In response to a validated operational need and an aging fleet of assault amphibian vehicles, the Marine Corps requirement for an amphibious vehicle that will provide increased force protection, water speed, land mobility, lethality, and survivability, while balancing capacity, mobility, transportability and total ownership costs over the current AAV is enduring. 

The basic chassis shall be a combat vehicle that is capable of performing across the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO).
  Core characteristics of the vehicle family will be as follows:  

Maneuver.   While the ideal capability would be for the vehicle to transit from well over the horizon at a high rate of speed, this may prove to be unaffordable.  At a minimum, the vehicle must be able to autonomously deliver a Marine infantry squad from amphibious shipping at launch distances at, or beyond the horizon (minimum of 12 miles) with a speed to enable the element of surprise in the buildup ashore, and provide combat-ready Marines at the objective.  The vehicle must be able to execute a seamless transition from sea to land and maneuver with a mechanized task force for sustained operations ashore.

Protection.  The materiel approaches must enable the commander to employ maneuver forces in threat environments while minimizing losses en route to objectives or while performing mounted missions.
  Protection characteristics must be applied to direct fire, indirect fire, and mines/IED threats.  In order to address the spectrum of operating environments, this protection can be modular (i.e., applied incrementally as the situation dictates.

Sustainment.   The materiel approaches must enable the commander to employ mounted maneuver forces at greater ranges to objectives and allow them to remain engaged while performing missions for greater durations than the current system.  They should enable the Marine Corps to rapidly integrate emerging technologies through the use of open architecture and reconfigure the interior to support alternative mission loads including logistics provisions (55gal drums etc.,) heavy weapons (mortar/rockets) and medical evacuations (litters).
  

Situational awareness.  The materiel approaches must enable the commander to employ mounted maneuver forces with improved connectivity and real-time situational awareness, whether en route or on the objective.

Lethality.  The materiel approach must enable the commander to employ mechanized forces with the capability to engage/destroy threat peer vehicles and provide direct fire support to dismounted infantry in the attack.  

The following required capabilities identified by the Marine Corps must be addressed by the amphibious vehicle: 

1.  The capability to rapidly project force directly to the objective from strategic and operational distances. 

2.  Forcible entry capabilities combined with lift capabilities that facilitate maneuver from strategic and operational off-shore distances and deliver forces where the adversary does not expect.

3.
  The capability to avoid a tactical pause from the waterline.

4.  The capability to maneuver with the M1A1 in a mechanized task force.

5.  The capability to increase force survivability through the use of speed, lethality, modular armor, reduced signature (heat/visibility) and the ability to apply force from standoff distances. 

6  The capability to connect to the Global Information Grid, and enable Over-the-Horizon, On-The-Move communications, Combat Identification, and Battle-staff communications to provide battlefield situational awareness.  

 7.  The capability to deliver lethal direct fire to enemy forces and Armored Personnel Carriers/Infantry Fighting Vehicles from a stabilized system with a precision fire control system during day/night operations.
  

8.  The capability to maximize fuel efficiency without realizing performance degradation during operational assaults. 

These requirements are not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive, meaning that we are requesting trade space feedback from industry. 

The amphibious vehicle must be configured in multiple variants.  Basic variants desired include:

Squad Maneuver / Fighting Vehicle

Command and Control (C2)

Recovery and Maintenance 

With this in mind, Combat Development and Integration (CD&I) and Program Executive Office Land Systems (PEO LS) are conducting a Request For Information (RFI) to obtain industry input relative to its current capabilities to identify potential material solutions to replace the AAV and the timeframe to provide.
  We desire any information on capabilities and performance of the respondents systems/subsystems as it relates to the requirements in this document.  Please include the following information in your response:

1.	What technically mature systems/subsystems are available to meet the requirements? This should include both development status (design verification testing and design/configuration stability) and production status of major subsystems and components. (Can you build them?)

2.	Using Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) provide matrices that compare the potential system in your approach, technical maturity, performance and schedule trade-offs and risks associated with each system/subsystem.
  Address integration maturity of your approach. (Is it a demonstrated design approach?)

3.	What are the primary complexity and cost drivers associated with our requirements as they relate to your approach? (Are they affordable?)

4.	Specify trade space issues/concerns for both feasibility and cost. 
(What are the tough requirements?)

5.	Propose a timeline and/or acquisition approach to procure the vehicles using the standard DOD Milestone Chart from MS A to C. (Should include major milestones, Systems Engineering Technical Reviews, Design and Fabrication and Test and Evaluation and major logistic events.) In addition, include suggested methodologies enabling program streamlining and acceleration.

6.	Estimate RDT&E and Production Unit Costs  Please provide your basis for cost as follows: Provide dollars in FY11, Total quantity, Quantity per year, Fly Away cost, and Total program cost.

Interested parties should include a general vehicle description to include gross vehicle weight, drive train configuration, weapon systems, communication systems, crew protection systems and approach, etc., vehicle drawings and/or renderings.
  It should also include vehicle performance characteristics (measured or estimated).  Responses should be limited to 30 pages with additional information on a CD ROM.  Provide response via two hardcopies and CD ROMs.  Responses are due 22 April 2011 by close of business to Valerie Mosqueira, 2200 Lester St. Building 2204 Quantico VA 22134.  

NOTE: This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52-215-3. No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation.

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT's) Common Operating Environment's (COE) Cyber Security Program plans to award a Purchase Order to Lunarline, Inc., for the funding and acquisition of security-related software to enable continuous monitoring capabilities of threats and penetration as mandated by the Office of Management &amp; Budget (OMB). <br />The expectation is to pilot/test software that enables continuous monitoring, compliance and vulnerability management of a subset of the COE environment. This pilot will include the implementation of SCAP compliant monitoring tools (ThreatGuard) as well as the Enterprise Vulnerability Compliance Manager (EVCM). The COE Team is currently managing vulnerabilities manually and with over 40,000 vulnerabilities, cannot continue to properly manage new as well as existing vulnerabilities and pending remediation. The CM platform will enable the Team to manage vulnerabilities as well as test against those reported as corrected so to ensure proper remediation.<br />Although the Government will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, any interest shown by sources interested in competing for this requirement on subsequent acquisitions, it is not expected that any vendor other than Lunarline, Inc., will be able to provide the level of pricing to support the mission needs for the Common Operating Environment. <br />

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) being released pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10 - Market Research. TSA intends to utilize this RFI as a means of performing market research to survey the state of the market in relation to the availability of additional capabilities beyond what Microsoft includes in SharePoint software. TSA is considering purchasing a third party SharePoint tool (COTS) that provides workflow and business logic capabilities to end/power users. TSA anticipates that by installing a COTS workflow tool, end users will be able to develop workflows through their browser with no coordination with their organization's IT professionals. TSA believes that their objectives can be achieved by purchasing a COTS product which allows users to have access to a Web-based environment that makes it easy to create a process that meets their needs. Once a workflow is created, a user can manage the business logic and tasks in the workflow, develop custom notifications, and report/audit the workflow once it is completed.
<p>Please see the attachment for additional information and detailed instructions for submitting a response to this RFI. TSA reserves the right to use information from the responses to this RFI to determine if any small business set-asides may be applicable to any solicitation that may result from this RFI. Vendors wishing to submit a proposal to any subsequent solicitation must monitor FedBizOpps for the synopsis.</p>
<p>This Request for Information is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.</p>

<DESC>C--THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  DO NOT REGISTER AS A PLANSHOLDER. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the US Army Corps of Engineers intends to sole source the CorKey Control Systems door locks and Johnson Controls Incorporated Building Automation Control System in support of a Design and Build Contract for the New Antilles Elementary School to be located on Ft. Buchanan Army Reserve Installation, Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. <BR><BR>The New Antilles Elementary School is part of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). CorKey Control System door locks are the standard key control system used by DoDEA Americas schools in Puerto Rico as well as all locations throughout the United States for limiting access to certain rooms. The CorKey lock is unlike other similar card-operated locks as it is not electronic. It is therefore, ultimately dependable, with no batteries to fail or lack of operability during power outages.  Reliable and secure key control is critical to ensure the safety and security of the students that our service members have entrusted to DODEA. The CorKey system is currently utilized at all DoDEA schools in Puerto Rico, including the existing Antilles Elementary School.  Utilizing the same manufacturer allows ease of keying, re-keying and tracking of keys across the three separate campuses greatly enhancing security with the added benefit of operations and maintenance cost savings.  Should a different system be utilized a potential exists for decreased security and safety of the teachers and students as well as increased lifetime O&M costs. The anticipated dollar amount of the CorKey lock is $119,900.00<BR><BR>DoDEA requires that the community or installation school district's building automation control system must be 100% compatible with its existing systems, ensuring seamless communications without the loss of features and capabilities.  All Ft. Buchanan installation schools currently utilize Johnson Control Inc. (JCI) Building Automation Control Systems, a network that controls and monitors many systems including, but not limited to HVAC, moisture, and lighting.  JCI controls and software are proprietary and other manufacturer's systems may not be 100% compatible and able to ensure seamless communications across the three campuses.  Additionally, utilizing a non-JCI system for the new elementary school would cause a duplication of costs due to extensive duplication of data tracking, monitoring, maintenance and training efforts.  Due to the current utilization of JCI systems across the three Ft Buchanan DoDEA campuses Johnson Controls is the only manufacturer that can provide the building automation system and direct digital controls to meet the requirements of the Ft. Buchanan installation schools ensuring a seamless extension of the existing system to the new elementary school.  The anticipated dollar amount of the Johnson Control System is approximately $279,000.00. <BR><BR>The magnitude of construction of the project is $25,000,000.00-$100,000,000.00. The work is located on Ft. Buchanan Army Reserve Installation, Puerto Rico.  A solicitation for the Design Build construction contract for the New Antilles Elementary School will be issued on or about March 25, 2011 with proposals due on or about April 26, 2011.<BR><BR>Parties may identify their interest and capabilities to meet the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 and respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within seven calendars days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <BR><BR>Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Karla M. Garcia at 904-232-1433 or email at Karla.M.Garcia@usace.army.mil. <BR>

<a href="mailto:Melissa.Maloy@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to make changes to the RFI and to provide responses to questions. 

Following are the changes:

The title of this RFI is changed from "ePMO IPT" to "OPP Umbrella Acquisition."

Under Task Areas, "Actuarial Analysis" is added.

Under SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS, "10 pages" is added to "Capabilities Statement and Market Information." 

Following are questions received and responses:

1.	Judging by the sources sought, it sounds as if these services are not being procured on this comprehensive of a scale; however, I was wondering if there was an incumbent contractor performing these services, possibly on a smaller scale.  If so, could you please provide the contractor, contract number, and award date?

ANSWER: Currently there is no such incumbent contractor in place. However, there may be multiple incumbents on the task order level.

2.	Could you please clarify, is this related to a business environment for a software environment?

ANSWER:  This RFI relates to requirements for services in the task areas described.

3.	Can a company respond to this RFI focusing on only selected skills sets or areas of interest?

ANSWER:  Yes, a company can respond focusing on only selected skills sets or areas of interest, but the Government requests that the company be specific as to which areas they will be able to perform (i.e., provide answers to Questions 1 and 2 of the RFI).

4.	There does not appear to be a page limit to the response, but only a one page limit to the cover page and also one page for the index.  Is there a page limit, or at least a recommended length for responding to the ten questions? If yes, please indicate whether the cover sheet and index are included in the page limitation (e.g. font size, margins, spacing)?

ANSWER: Please limit the responses to 10 pages not including the cover sheet and index.  Please use a minimum font size of 10 point and margins of 1 inch on all sides.  Single spacing is acceptable.

5.	Is this a procurement for Veterans Affairs's Office of Policy & Planning or for Veterans Health Administration's Office of Policy & Planning?

ANSWER: The primary customer is VA's Office of Policy & Planning.  However, VA's OPP has multiple VACO clients it supports, including, but not limited to, Veteran Health Administration's (VHA's) Office of Policy and Planning.

6.	Who is the owner? Is this a procurement for a specific Office within the Office of Policy & Planning, or does it cover all of OPP's activities?

ANSWER:  All of OPP and its existing and potential clients. 

7.	Could the Government provide clarification on the type of records that require analysis and verification?

ANSWER:  Most commonly, veteran records.  Administrative records of various kinds may also be included.  

8.	Could the Government provide examples of the processes that would require sustainment.  To what extent would these processes need to be sustained?

ANSWER:  Examples would include, but not be limited to, functional processes, such as the process of providing meals to Veteran patients, the process of maintaining VA facilities, and the process of operating Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) laundries.  Sustainment would pertain to sustaining gains achieved in business process redesign efforts.

9.	Does the Government anticipate awarding multiple ID/IQs?  If so, how will the task areas be grouped?

ANSWER:  The Government reserves the right to award multiple IDIQs. It is currently unknown whether the Government will award one set of ID/IQs to cover all task areas or multiple sets of ID/IQs to cover groups of task areas.  The Government anticipates using information from responses to this RFI as a resource for this decision. The individual task orders shall be placed as the requirement is needed and may cover multiple task areas.

10.	Does the Government anticipate finding one firm to cover all task areas or are firms that can only address some of the tasks encouraged to propose?

ANSWER: This is a request for information rather than a request for proposal.  At this time, companies that can cover either all or a portion of the requirement are encouraged to respond.

11.	Would a subcontractor under a T4 contract be prohibited from receiving a contract award under this new initiative or will an approved conflict of interest mitigation plan be acceptable?

ANSWER:  Submitting an offer and/or being awarded a contract as a result of the T-4 solicitation will not preclude a company from submitting an offer on the upcoming RFP or being awarded a contract in support of this requirement.  Conflicts of interest may arise depending on the nature of future requirements.  The VA anticipates the RFP and resulting contracts will include language to address this issue.
      
12.	Please provide examples of requirements for the "Corporate Analysis and Evaluation" task area.

ANSWER:  Examples would include, but not be limited to: Corporate planning, programming, budgeting and evaluation; studying the availability of services and benefits provided by entities other than VA, such as state and local governments; and studying the capacity of VA to meet future Veteran needs.  

13.	Is the "Studies and Analyses" task area intended to represent studies as they are defined in the Management Analysis/Business Process Reengineering Program Management Manual? If not, please provide examples of requirements for the task area.

ANSWER:  Studies and analyses are not intended to be limited by such a representation.  They could include a variety of projects, such as various management studies and statistical analyses.

14.	The "Key Examples of Requirements" section of the RFI lists "Analyze and verify records". Is there additional detail about the type of record and what is being verified?

ANSWER:  See the answer to question 7.

15.	What is the anticipated release date for the solicitation?

ANSWER:  The anticipated release date for the solicitation is unknown at this time.
  
16.	Does the agency anticipate having the contract staff on-site, embedded with agency staff?

ANSWER:  This is possible and will be defined at the task order level.

17.	Should responses to the RFI be individual firms or collectively as a potential team?  

ANSWER:  Either is acceptable at the discretion of the responder.
  
18.	Does the agency anticipate a firm fixed price or time & materials contract?

ANSWER:  VA anticipates any awarded contracts will allow for firm fixed price and time and materials task orders, dependent upon the requirement.   

19.	Will some of the contract staff be full time FTE?

ANSWER:  This is possible and will be defined at the task order level.  

20.	Is all of the work in Washington, DC or other locations?  If other, where?

ANSWER:  The Government intends to provide the anticipated scope in the RFP and resultant contracts.  Actual place of performance will be specified at the task order level.

21.	What is the anticipated contract period of performance?

ANSWER:  The anticipated contract period of performance 5 years from the date of award.
  
22.	Will VA provide definitions for the task areas?  Could task areas be combined for those with much overlap - for example, business process improvement could encompass quality management, change management, business process reengineering, etc.

ANSWER:  The VA intends to define the task areas in the RFP and contract level.  Further definitization may be provided at the task order level.   

23.	For this effort is VA primarily seeking subject matter expertise or program management expertise to support Transformation 21 initiatives?

ANSWER:  VA seeks a wide variety of expertise which is described in the RFI.  This includes, but is not limited to, both subject matter expertise and program management expertise in a broad number of potential requirements in support of various initiatives, including, but not limited to, Transformation 21.  

24.	In the Quality Management task area is VA seeking clinical quality management expertise or business-focused quality management qualifications?

ANSWER:  Both would be considered desirable expertise/qualifications.  

25.	The RFI includes actuarial analyses in the Description of Requirement section, yet actuarial analyses are not included in the list of Task Areas. Is it VA's intent that actuarial analyses be a required task area?

ANSWER:  VA's intent at this time is that actuarial analyses represent a potential task area. 

26.	Will only respondents to the RFI be eligible to respond to any resulting RFP?

ANSWER:  We encourage all interested parties to respond to the resulting RFP.

27.	What proportion of task orders would be conducted on a government site? 

ANSWER:  No such proportion has been definitized at this time.    

28.	Does the Dept. of VA foresee a potential conflict of interest regarding future development work?

ANSWER:  Conflicts of interest may arise depending on the nature of future requirements.  The VA anticipates the RFP and resulting contracts will include language to address this issue. 

29.	What would the typical task order duration be?

ANSWER:  No such typical task order duration has been definitized at this time.  

30.	Does the government contemplate designating any set-asides?

ANSWER:  The acquisition plan has not yet been established.  The goal of this RFI is to gather capabilities and market information pertinent for acquisition planning. The responses to this RFI will contribute to determining the method of procurement and identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement.

31.	Can you provide examples of the type of training to be provided by the contractor?

ANSWER:  Examples of training would include, but not be limited to, training in the Malcolm Baldrige Performance Excellence criteria; performance improvement approaches; and quality management.  

32.	The scope of work outlined in the RFI is potentially quite broad. Does the VA anticipate that requirements in all areas will be well-defined enough for firm fixed price Task Orders, or does VA anticipate a blend of firm fixed price and time & materials Task Orders?

ANSWER:  See the answer to question 18.  

33.	The RFI mentions that there is a significant amount of current support work performed for the office. Please state the areas of support currently leveraging contractor support and which companies are providing that support? 

ANSWER:  Some areas of support include assessment and analysis, business process improvement, and project management expertise by Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; predictive modeling by The Lewin Group; management analysis, business process reengineering, and program/project management support with Grant Thornton LLP; quality management support and studies by The MITRE Corporation; and data analysis by Altarum Institute and Acxiom Corporation.

34.	How many procurement vehicles are currently being used to obtain contractor services and are these commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools or in-house developed?

ANSWER:  Multiple vehicles are currently being used to provide services in these task areas.  Both COTS and developed tools have been used to satisfy the VA's requirements.

35.	Do you envision this procurement replacing or augmenting the existing support that you have?

ANSWER: Task orders under the awarded contracts may replace, continue, or augment existing support.

36.	Are you seeking to satisfy small business goals with this procurement?

ANSWER:  The Department of Veterans Affairs has a commitment to satisfy small business goals whenever possible.  

37.	Are you seeking to satisfy additional socio-economic goals with this procurement?

ANSWER: The Department of Veterans Affairs always seeks to satisfy socio-economic goals when possible.

38.	You indicate a multiple award IDIQ scenario, and suggest GSA Federal Supply Schedule access. Are you considering a GSA procurement?

ANSWER:  At this time we are considering all options available.

39.	Are you considering a GSA Blanket Purchase Agreement for agency wide access?

ANSWER:  At this time we are considering all options available.

<p><br />Category 6 UTP Drop Installation Statement of Work</p>
<p>Services: <br />&bull; Contractor needs to provide a minimum of 10 year warranty on all parts that are being installed. The contractor shall have a service location site within a 50 mile radius of NMCP to be able to respond on-site within 2 hours of an initial service call if warranty work is required. Contractor will provide all labor and materials to install, test, and terminate the required amount of (according to the 4270 purchasing document) plenum rated twisted 4 pair, UTP, 100 Ohm, 24 AWG, 500 MHz (minimum) category 6 communication drops to be used for data communication. All cables will be run in the existing cable trays except as specifically exempted in writing by the NMCP COTR before installation. Contractor will make use of the interstitial, existing junction boxes (must properly drilled and sleeved so box can be closed and secured after installation), conduits and adding to the current data jacks if possible. The cable backbone will be secured to the building structure every ten feet with proper fasteners if there are no existing cable trays or conduit. No cable run will be longer than 90 meters or 295 feet to allow placement of patch cables and still meet the maximum CAT6 limit of 95 meters or 327 feet. This includes an 18 inch concealed courtesy loop at the user end and 10 foot service loop at the closet end. Cables shall not bend beyond the radius specified by the manufacturer and should not bend beyond the Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard (TIA/EIA-568-B.1 Chap 10.2.1, and TIA/EIA B.1-1 Addendum 1). All cable, when penetrating a firewall, will be sleeved and sealed with fire stopping and will not exceed the 80% fill rate in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC). UTP cable jacketing will be stripped IAW ANSI/EIA/TIA 568B standards. In addition, the cabling will be run IAW ANSI/EIA/TIA standards to ensure cabling is not run over top of lighting or violating any other set standards. Drops will be installed as home runs from the user wall plate to the communication closet. All drops will be terminated at the user end with RJ-45 angled modular jacks (Panduit, Leviton or Ortronics when required). The outlets will be in flush or surface mounted boxes with single, dual, triple or quad face plates. Surface mounted boxes will only be used when flush mounted jacks are not feasible (this will need to be approved by Networking and Facilities at NMCP). Drops are to be installed only where existing electrical outlets exist within 6 feet, but not less than 3 feet, do not cross doorways, and will not cohabitate with electrical runs in modular furniture or conduits leading from the overhead. Data cables will be punched down on a government provided category 6 patch panel if present or a contractor provided patch panel (a modular Panduit or Leviton) if required in the 4270. All category 6 cables will be 100% tested to EIA/TIA standards upon completion of installation. Drops will be labeled in accordance with site labeling standards. All labeling will be machine produced; no handwritten labels are permitted to remain on the cabling. The standard used at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth is communications closet name and drop number. For example 2A01-005, would be a properly labeled drop. All drops will have the room, outlet, and drop number on both ends of each cable. The same labeling will be found on the wall plate as well as the patch panel in the communication closet. When testing the cabling, the drops and the patch panel in the communications closet will be checked for correct labeling and accuracy. Once drops have been completed in any area with both installation and testing, contractor needs to contact the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389) to have the completed work inspected for accuracy and completion. At least 10% of the drop testing will be observed by a representative from the Network Team. During move, relocation or construction projects all cabling that is disconnected SHOULD NOT be left in the ceiling. Vendor must completely remove the cable from the wall jack to the patch panel and carefully document the drop number that was removed.

<DESC>This is a Sole Source Notice for commercial service items prepared in accordancewith the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information includedin this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are beingrequested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Quotation (RFQ) to Orbital DataNet (ODN), MO, to procure satellite subscription services, hardware storage cases, andtechnical support to recently procured satellite dish communications systems supportingEnvironmental Continuous Air Monitors (ECAMs) in support of the Mars Science Lab (MSL)mission as specified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).	NASAA/KSC intends to purchase these services from ODN. It would take a substantialduplication of time and effort for another company to provide comparable satellitecommunications systems support, and those costs are not expected to be recovered throughcompetition. In October 2008 the ODN satisfactorily supported system verification & validation testspreviously on fifteen (15) satellite communications systems previously used withEnvironmental Continuous Air Monitor (ECAM)  systems that are in use at NASA KSC.  Thesetests are now required for 15 existing and 15 new units recently purchased from ODN. Monitoring units must be able to communicate with the master control site at theRadiological Control Center at KSC.  Satellite time and transmission systems provided byODN have been integrated with the existing and new ECAM units to create a network ofmonitoring stations in support of the MSL launch.  Satellite coverage and modem hardwareis unique to this vendor and the configured ECAM units.  Purchase of support servicesfrom competing system vendors would not be practical and would directly impact ability tomeet launch readiness dates. Hardware transport cases are custom built by the vendor to match the hardware procuredunder prior purchase from this vendorThe authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 ofthe Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1). The Government intends to acquirea commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their quotation or capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00p.m. local time on February  23, 2011. Such detailed capabilities and qualifications mustdemonstrate in writing the ability to meet this requirement and will be evaluated solelyfor the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.

<DESC>This is a Sole Source Notice for commercial service items prepared in accordancewith the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information includedin this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are beingrequested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Quotation (RFQ) to CanberraIndustries, Inc., CT, to procure Technical Support Services for thirty EnvironmentalContinuous Air Monitors (ECAMs) in support of the Mars Science Lab (MSL) mission asspecified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).	NASAA/KSC intends to purchase these services from Canberra. It would take a substantialduplication of time and effort for another company to provide comparable ECAM support,and those costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. Canberra has satisfactorily conducted system verification & validation tests previouslyon fifteen (15) of these ECAM systems that are in use at NASA KSC and now would be askedto conduct these tests again on the original 15 units plus the 15 new units recentlypurchased from the vendor.  Monitoring units must be able to communicate with the mastercontrol site at the Radiological Control Center.  The proprietary Canberra ECAM RadHawksoftware enables communication with the monitoring unit and a graphical user interfacefor querying each of the systems individually and displaying overall status of thenetwork.  This software has also been further customized by the vendor to enablecommunications and data transfer with the US Department of Energy radiological monitoringdatabase system which would be the primary source of radiological information for healthand safety decision-making in the event of a launch area accident.  Purchase of supportservices from competing system vendors would not be practical and would directly impactability to meet launch readiness dates. Training, calibration and setup costswould haveto be coordinated between two different suppliers, increasing cost of the service andtime spent in coordinating the work.The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 ofthe Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1).

This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />The reference solicitation number is: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-084-DDC.
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures in accordance with FAR 13.3 Simplified Acquisition Methods, and FAR Part 13.5</p>
<p>The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-049. The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $6.5 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted as a full open competition with set aside for a small business only. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334516 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Government=s anticipated delivery date is one year after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>The Government=s acceptance terms and FOB point are the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>Background Information<br />The Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Branch of the Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is one of the premier cardiovascular programs in the country that develops new methods for the study of cardiovascular disease and the application of image-guided therapies. The Cardiovascular Interventional Program has conducted work that includes wholly real-time MRI guided vascular interventional procedures in humans, as well as preclinical development of novel interventional procedures for the treatment of congenital heart disease.</p>
<p><br />The procurement of a new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Cardiovascular Interventional Coil shall improve the performance of rapid imaging for interventional applications and enable new procedures to be developed. A coil is sought which contains multiple surface coil elements optimized for accelerated imaging, and fenestrations, which will allow direct access to the thorax.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to identify qualified organizations that can manufacture a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coil, which has fenestrations (windows) to allow the passage of interventional devices. The coil will be used for preclinical and clinical MRI guided cardiovascular interventions at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), conducted on a clinical Siemens 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. The coil must conform to the specific technical requirements listed below.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The NHLBI requires that the MRI Cardiovascular Interventional Coil be of clinical grade to support sterile patient procedures, and to interface to MRI scanners currently installed, as well as the next generation. Detailed requirements are listed below.<br />Services to be performed<br />The Contractor shall deliver an MRI Cardiovascular Interventional Coil to NHLBI, along with supporting files that enable the coil to be recognized by and function with the MRI scanner. The coil should connect to the existing MRI system, as well as the next generation system. A delivery timeline and warranty period should be specified.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements:<br />(1) The coil must connect to a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner. The NHLBI currently has an Espree, which will be upgraded to an Aera. The coil must be able to connect to both models.<br />(2) The coil should cover the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thorax.<br />(3) The anterior portion of the coil should accommodate different body shapes. This may be accomplished either by the use of a flexible form factor or by multiple segments.<br />(4) The coil should cover a nominal imaging field of view of a minimum of 30cm (Right - Left) x 30cm (Head - Foot).<br />(5) The coil should contain a minimum of two fenestrations on each (Right, Left) side of the anterior portion of the coil, to allow access to the intercostal spaces.<br />(6) It is desirable for the coil to contain fenestrations along the midline of the chest, to allow access to the sub-xiphoid space.<br />(7) The fenestrations in the coil should be a minimum of 3cm long in the smallest dimension.<br />(8) The fenestrations should be able to made sterile, so that sterile devices that pass through remain sterile. <br />(9) The coil should contain a minimum of 8 elements in each (anterior and posterior) portion, to enable parallel imaging. More than 8 elements are desirable.</p>
<p><br />Evaluation Criteria<br />The proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria;</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria (total 100 points)<br />The proposals shall be evaluated by NIH with regards to the design and anticipated performance of the coil. Weight shall be given to the timeliness of delivery, technical performance, and overall design<br />1) Schedule (20 pts)<br />a. The final version of the coil must be delivered within one year after the contract is awarded. Prototypes may be delivered for testing and technical feedback at intermediate times. <br />2) Performance (35 pts)<br />a. The coil must perform equivalently or better than the current Siemens cardiac array (also called body array), in terms of signal-to-noise during non-accelerated imaging. NHLBI is willing to work with the vendor to perform these tests at the NIH.<br />b. The coil must perform equivalently or better than the current Siemens cardiac array (also called body array), in terms of signal-to-noise and "G-factor" when performing accelerated imaging. NHLBI is willing to work with the vendor to perform these tests at the NIH.<br />3) Design (45 pts)<br />a. The coil must connect to a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner. The NHLBI currently has an Espree, which will be upgraded to an Aera. The coil must be able to connect to both models. <br />i. A coil file must be supplied by the vendor, which will enable the coil to be recognized by the Siemens scanner.<br />ii. The coil code must not conflict with any currently used product or custom coils used. This code should be chosen together by the NIH and the vendor.<br />c. The coil should cover the anterior surface of the thorax. For the posterior portion, one of two options are acceptable:<br />i. A second coil to cover the posterior portion (preferable).<br />ii. Use of the Siemens spine coil to cover the posterior portion. However, the performance of parallel imaging must still be acceptable.<br />d. The anterior portion of the coil should accommodate different body shapes. This may be accomplished either by the use of a flexible form factor or by multiple segments.<br />e. The coil should cover a nominal imaging field of view of a minimum of 30cm (Right - Left) x 30cm (Head - Foot).<br />f. The coil should contain a minimum of two fenestrations on each (Right, Left) side of the anterior portion of the coil, to allow access to the intercostal spaces.<br />g. It is desirable for the coil to contain fenestrations along the midline of the chest, to allow access to the sub-xiphoid space.<br />h. The fenestrations in the coil should be a minimum of 3cm long in the smallest dimension.<br />i. The fenestrations should be able to be made sterile, so that sterile devices that pass through remain sterile. <br />j. The coil should contain a minimum of 8 elements in the anterior portion of the coil. If a posterior portion is delivered, a minimum of 8 elements should be included in the posterior portion as well. More than 8 elements are desirable.</p>

Contractors are strongly encouraged to visit the site and take such other steps as may be reasonably necessary to ascertain the nature and location of the work and the general and local conditions which can affect the cost of the work thereof, prior to closing of this solicitation.  Failure to do so shall not relieve offerors from responsibility for estimating properly the difficulty or cost of successfully performing the work.  The Government will assume no responsibility for any understanding or misrepresentations concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of the contract, unless included in this solicitation, the specifications or related documents.

B)   In the evaluation of proposals, all evaluation factors in paragraphs 7.1  7.3 below other than cost or price, when combined, are considered to be significantly more important than cost or price.  The relative importance to be placed on the factors in relation to each other is contained in SECTION 7, PARAGRAPH E. However, the degree of importance of cost or price may increase with the degree of non-cost or non-price equality between the proposals. If a proposal is determined by the Contracting Officer to be "technically unacceptable" as a result of evaluating all factors other than cost or price, the proposal may be rejected from further consideration. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make award to other than the technically-acceptable offeror with the lowest cost/price proposal if it is determined that the technical benefits of another offeror's proposal justify its higher cost/price. The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to make award to a lower-cost/price, lower-scored offeror if it is determined that the cost/price premium involved in awarding to a higher-rated, higher-cost/price offeror is not justified. 
C)   Pursuant to FAR 15.305, a cost or price evaluation may be performed to determine the reasonableness of costs or prices proposed and the offeror's understanding of, and ability to perform, the prospective contract. The Government is prohibited from awarding a contract to an offeror unless their proposed prices are determined to be fair and reasonable.

"Waste reduction" means preventing or decreasing the amount of waste being generated through waste prevention, recycling, or purchasing recycled and environmentally preferable products.
(b) Consistent with the requirements of Section 701 of Executive Order 13101, the Contractor shall establish a program to promote cost-effective waste reduction in all operations and facilities covered by this contract. The Contractor's programs shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local requirements, specifically including Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6962, et seq.) and implementing regulations (40 CFR part 247).
Prohibition on text Messaging and Using Electronic Equipment Supplied by the Government While Driving Executive Order 13513, Federal Leadership on Reducing Text Messaging While Driving, was signed by President Barack Obama on October 1, 2009 (ref.: http://edocket.acce4ss.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-24203.pdf).   This Executive Order introduces a Federal Government-wide prohibition on the use of text messaging while driving on official business or while using Government-supplied Equipment.  Additional guidance enforcing the ban will be issued at a later date.  In the meantime, please adopt and enforce policies that immediately ban text messaging while driving company-owned or -rented vehicles, government-owned or leased vehicles, or while driving privately owned vehicles when on official government business or when performing any work for or on behalf of the government.
The Office of the Acquisition and Property Management will issue additional policies and procedures on implementing the Executive Order in the Department of the Interior Acquisition Regulation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with AMGRAF, INC. This requirement is being advertised under Other Than Full and Open Competition by the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302.
<p>The IBEAM (Information Base for Exchange Administration and Management) system was originally designed by the U.S. Census Bureau to support paper questionnaire development via an interface with the AMGRAF, INC. software (OFDP, One Form Designer Plus). The legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface was used to support the development of many questionnaires for the 2010 Decennial Census program. The legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface enabled several division resources throughout the bureau in the content development, questionnaire design and questionnaire data capture of the decennial census questionnaires. Because of the tight coupling of IBEAM and OFDP, ongoing technical support from AMGRAF, INC. was required to ensure stability.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau is embarking on the development of a greatly enhanced for future questionnaire development. The richer, enhanced IBEAM/OFDP interface is being developed under a separate existing agreement.<br /><br />Technical support will be required for the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface used to support the 2010 Decennial program until the legacy interface is retired.<br /><br />The contractor shall provide isolated maintenance and training services for the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface. The expected outcome is that the Systems Support Division (SSD) will be able to obtain maintenance software support for the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface on an ongoing basis and to request training services on the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface as requested by the users in Census in a timely manner. The legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface will be preserved completely separate from the development of the enhanced IBEAM/OFDP interface to ensure successful usage of the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface until it is retired.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be from Date of Award through one year with one option year. This will be awarded by government purchase order on a fixed price basis. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted electronically, via email to Tanisha Contee of the U.S. Census Bureau, Acquisition Division. This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government. Phone calls will not be honored. If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis, a contract may be issued to AMGRAF, INC. without further notice.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<BR><BR>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,<BR><BR>(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <BR><BR>(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<BR><BR>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<BR><BR>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<BR><BR>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(ii) Examples. <BR><BR>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<BR><BR>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<BR><BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<BR><BR>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<BR><BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>C3CEN purchased the H series Open Eye Video Recorder Model OE3-HR36012 under contract HSCG23-07-P-TED232. When the final option was exercised the Coast Guard did not purchase the total number of units available on the option. The Coast Guard was not aware at the time that Open Eye had discontinued Model OE3-HR36012 and the upgraded unit was not backward compatible with the existing equipment. In order to maintain the units already deployed in the field, it was decided to purchase the balance of 15 units left on the contract.</p>
<p>(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. <br />The DVR recorders are Open Eye Model HDDR H-Series 12 channel recorders which include 500 GB internal hard drive and DVD burner as well as an accessory package. The model number assigned by Open Eye is OE3-HR36012. This Requirement is for 15 each units.<br />Total Estimated amount for these items is: between 65K-67K.</p>
<p>(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <br />6.302-1 (2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>
<p>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br />When contract HSCG23-07-P-TED232 was issued, Open Eye (OEM) released the total number of units to Commercial Technology Group (one of Open Eye's authorized distributors). Commercial Technology Group has held the full contract inventory in stock to fulfill the Coast Guard's option requirements as required.</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.</p>
<p>The original requirement was posted on GSA e-buy and FEDBIZ OPS as a unrestricted combined synopsis solicitation. This subsequent requirement will be posted to FEDBIZ OPS including verbiage that any Offeror that feels that they can provide Items that meet this requirement as stated may provide a quotation, and all offers will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. <br />This equipment is a COTS off the shelf item that is at the end of life production. The cost to purchase the remaining units from Commercial Technology Group should not exceed the original negotiated amount. The anticipated cost will be the same the General Public would pay for the same items.</p>
<p>(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. <br />Market research was conducted under the base contract HSCG2307PTED232 and prior to the exercise of each option.</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: <br />This purchase of the balance of 15 DVR recorders shall be used to maintain the equipment currently deployed on the cutters. Without the spares, the Coast Guard is left with equipment that cannot be repaired and cannot be replaced by the manufacturer. The spares will allow the Coast Guard to maintain the equipment for the full life cycle.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. None</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. <br />At this time, there is no anticipation of replacement of the DVR systems currently deployed. Once the equipment reaches the point where technology refresh is required, all equipment will require replacement, requiring a new Contract. This replacement is not anticipated for several years.</p>
<p>(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. <br />(a) This is a valid requirement to purchase the balance of the spares from the expired contract. The spares will enable the project to maintain the DVR already deployed.<br />(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel. <br />At the time the last option on the contract was exercised, it was not known by the government that the Open Eye Video Recorder Model OE3-HR36012 was no longer being manufactured by Open Eye and that the upgraded model is not backward compatible with Model OE3-HR36012. Purchasing the last 15 units will afford the Coast Guard the ability to replace any broken DVRs currently in use.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), MLCA Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor, the PBPL Availability Project Manager, and the NESU. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-11-Q-P45000 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 332999.<br /><br /><br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address:<br /><br /><br />Commandant (CG-9131), <br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, <br />Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, <br />1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, <br />Washington, DC. 20593, <br />Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.<br />

Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text<BR>available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the<BR>offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror<BR>may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or<BR>offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at these addresses:<BR>http://farsite.hill.af.mil/; http://www.arnet.gov/far/; http://akss.dau.mil/jsp/default.jsp;<BR>52.0000-4002 SHIPPING/DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS AND INFORMATION (FEB 2004)<BR>1. THE COMPLETE 13-DIGIT PURCHASE ORDER, DELIVERY ORDER, OR CONTRACT NUMBER (The<BR>Number that starts with W52P1J----) MUST BE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIPPING CONTAINER. This<BR>number must also appear on all packing slips, invoices, bills, or any communications regarding this order.<BR>2. A Packing List must be included with each shipment.<BR>3.

If actual acceptance occurs within the<BR>constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date<BR>of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept<BR>supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their<BR>responsibilities.<BR>52.0000-4003 DISCLOSURE OF UNIT PRICE INFORMATION (JUN 2005)<BR>This constitutes notification pursuant to Executive Order 12600, Pre-Disclosure Notification Procedures for<BR>Confidential Commercial Information (June 23,1987), of our intention to release unit prices of the awardee in<BR>response to any request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552.

<CONTACT>Tanisha Contee, Contract Specialist, Phone  , Email tanisha.l.contee@census.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau intends to procure services (maintenance renewal) needed for Tandberg and Gold TMS maintenance agreement. The maintenance and support will be for a period of October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011. Please see the services listed below. All responsible sources that can provide the services and meet the detailed requirements, may respond to this solicitation by submitting a quote to <a href="mailto:Tanisha.L.Contee@Census.gov">Tanisha.L.Contee@Census.gov</a>. Phone calls will not be honored. &nbsp;Award will be made by Government Purchase Order. Written responses should be received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis. Closing date and time for receipt of quotes will be on February 19, 2011, 9:00 am Eastern time. <br /><br />***QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS***<br /><br />
<p>1. Is the requirement just for the renewal purchase of these Tandberg<br />contracts? In other words, will no other service and support be required<br />from the vendor such as phone support, level 1 response to issues, onsite<br />visits etc.<br /><br />Answer - No we are the engineer on-site and handle ALL issues. This is just so we have coverage on the Endpoints for upgrades, and RMA's if something fails.<br />Something we are currently running without on a few CORE components to our<br />VTC infrastructure.</p>
<p>2. The quantity of 1000 MXP units is listed as 5 yet there are only 4<br />serial numbers listed. Is this a mistake in the count or is a serial number<br />missing? <br /><br />Answer - 13A30820</p>
<p>3. I've reached out to Cisco/Tandberg and my contact in their service renewal team mentioned that due to the expiration date of the existing contracts on these units, you cannot backdate the maintenance to 10/1/10. Instead, you will need to pay the recertification fee the goes direct to Cisco/Tandberg to get these units back under maintenance.<br /><br />Answer&nbsp;-&nbsp;If a point of contact has advised this information, please do so at your discretion.&nbsp; It is the contractor's responsibility to quote accordingly.</p>
<p>4. Per Tandberg, there are 2 serial numbers that are not in their system and they asked us to confirm with the customer on these SN#s. The SN's that are not in Tandberg's system are: 30A6522 +&nbsp;SM002ED.</p>
<p>5. Can you provide the correct serial 33's for the 770 MXP and MCU 4520 below?&nbsp; Both appear to be missing a single digit or letter.</p>

<DESC>Question 5:<BR>Is discipline-specific, risk-based experience a required qualification for the Level 2 and Level 3 personnel that are included in the proposal?  If yes, please be advised that finding qualified personnel with this type of risk experience at these levels in each discipline will be very difficult. <BR>Answer 5:<BR>In response to Question 5, the synopsis has been revised.  Please see the attached revision dated 17 February 2011 for changes.  Because the revision alters requirements that were originally included in the announcement, additional response time will be allowed.  The response date is hereby changed from 11:00 a.m. Central Time on 1 March 2011 to 11:00 a.m. Central Time on 24 March 2011.   <BR><BR>Please note: any firm with questions regarding the revised synopsis or any other aspect of this action are encouraged to submit the questions in writing as soon as possible in order to allow sufficient time for the questions to be answered and for firms to incorporate the answers as necessary into their submissions in sufficient time to comply with the response due date of 24 March 2011.<BR><BR>Question 6:<BR>Item 4 - Submission Requirements of the Solicitation states that the submittal should be 8.5 x 11 pages and minimum font size of 10.  May we use 11X17 for various tables?  If yes, will it count as one or two pages?  May we utilize a font smaller than 10 for our graphics and tables? <BR>Answer 6:<BR>Firms may use 11"x17" pages for tables and other graphics for which a larger page size is necessary.  Each 11"x17" page will be counted as two pages for the purposes of the maximum allowable page limit.  Graphics, tables, and charts may use a font size smaller than 10 as long as the text is readable.<BR><BR>Question 7:<BR>Item 3, Selection Criteria, B - states that "projects submitted must have been completed within the past three years from the date qualifications submittals are due".  We assume that this may include projects which are substantially complete or approximately 75% complete.  Is our assumption correct? <BR>Answer 7:<BR>Yes.<BR><BR>Question 8:<BR>Primary Criteria B, Specialized Experience -  The RFP seeks experience of the firm in providing experts for dam and levee safety projects for Levels 1, 2 and 3, each with specific criteria and years of experience.  It further states, that in order to be Level 3, the expert must meet the criteria for Level 1 and 2.  Therefore, based on these criteria, for a Structural Engineer to be Level 3 eligible they would have to have direct experience with hydraulic modeling for dam break analysis, seepage and stability analysis, etc.  These technical experiences would not be typical in industry of a Structural Engineer.  So, would it be appropriate to assume that this could mean general or managerial experience of each criteria in a project managed or participated in by the Level 3 expert?   Or is the intent that the Level 3 classification could be achieved by fulfilling the criteria for Level 1 and 2 only in the areas of your discipline expertise? <BR>Answer 8:<BR>The intent is that the level 3 classification could be achieved by fulfilling the criteria for Level 1 and 2 only in the area of the discipline expertise.   Carefully review the revised synopsis dated 17 February 2011 for more clarification regarding criteria.<BR><BR>All questions should be submitted in writing ONLY to the Contract Specialist Ms. Lee Ann White at lee.ann.white@usace.army.mil.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Senior Regional Advisors (SRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. SRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The SRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the SRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) in San Jose, Costa Rica.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs. The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Additional questions and answers received as of 16 February 2011:<br /><br />Q: We request your consideration for DFAR clause 252.225-7012 Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities) to be removed from the solicitation's terms and conditions. Many of the items requested are brand-specific and do not satisfy the Berry Amendment. This same equipment was previously supplied without the DFAR clause in effect.<br />A: DFARS 225.7002-3(a) prescribes the use of 252.225-7012, Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities, in solicitations and contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold unless an exception applies. One of the exceptions, under 252.225-7012(c)(5), states this clause does not apply "To chemical warfare protective clothing produced in a qualifying country". The qualifying countries are provided in para 225.7012(a)(3); therefore, while the clause is required in the solicitation, the quote submitted will be in compliance with the clause as long as the equipment is produced in the U.S. or a qualifying country. During the draft solicitation phase, all of the brand name specific items were analyzed and changed in the final solicitation manufactured in the U.S.
<p><br />Q: If the Berry Amendment is not removed, please be aware of the following non-compliance issues:<br />a. CLINS 001 and 0002 - The DuPont Responder suit specified does not satisfy DFAR 252.225-7012. <br />b. CLINS 004 and 0005 - The DuPont training suit specified does not satisfy DFAR 252.225-7012. The rear entry option, if selected, is Berry compliant.<br />c. CLINS 0016 and 0017 - The DuPont suit specified does not satisfy DFAR 252.225-7012. <br />d. CLINS 0020-0022 - The North butyl gloves are made in the USA but are not compliant with Berry. <br />e. CLINS 0023-0025 - The Best nitrile gloves are made in the USA but are not compliant with Berry.<br />A: Per DFAR clause 252.225-7012, paragraph (c)(5), the clause does not apply to chemical warfare protective clothing produced in a qualifying country. <br />a., b., and c. The DuPont suits are made in the USA with components from qualifying countries and therefore the garments are in compliance with the clause.<br />d. and e. Because the gloves are made in the USA they comply with paragraph (b) of DFARS 252.225-7012.</p>
<p><br />Q: Buy America Act and Balance of Payments Program - The DuPont items that do not satisfy DFAR 252.225-7012 do not satisfy DFAR 252.225-7001 in the event DFARS 252.225-7012 is removed.<br />A: Per FAR 12.505(a)(1), the component test of the Buy American Act does not apply to the acquisition of commercial off the shelf items. It also states the same in FAR 52.225-1(b) and DFARS 252.225-7001(b). So as long as the gloves are manufactured in the USA it does not matter where the components originate from.</p>

<DESC>16a. Description:
<p>The Defense Weather Systems Directorate (DWSD) Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) program office, on behalf of the United States Air Force, is seeking information from companies who could provide a production capability of seven (7) space-based Radio Frequency (RF) beacons flight articles and one (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) for remote sensing of ionospheric scintillation and line-of-sight Total Electron Content (TEC), and the associated payload to space vehicle integration and test support, and an option for commercially priced controlled storage facilities needed for the program. The RF beacon flight article is defined as a standard RF beacon. The addition of the language "flight article" should not imply that we are requesting anything other than the standard RF beacon.</p>
<p>Measurements of signals transmitted by a RF beacon flight article can be used to measure ionospheric properties such as the TEC along the signal propagation path, amplitude and phase scintillation indices at the transmitted frequencies. The TEC observations can be ingested into global assimilative models to improve ionospheric specification, and the scintillation observations can be used to estimate ionosphere-induced degradation of communication/navigation signals across the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>16b. Purpose:</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes. The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on existing technologies, or existing technologies with possible minor modifications that can be used to meet the sensing capabilities described in paragraph 16d, incorporating the listed Government assumptions. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in estimated cost and schedule information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 16d.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI# SMC-11-41 is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. We are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer from any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

<p>16d. Sensing Capability Information Sought:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information that provides an approach/information concerning the design and manufacturing of the RF beacon flight articles that would enable transmissions in the following frequency bands:</p>
<p>&bull; Coherent continuous wave UHF (e.g., 400 MHz) signal<br />&bull; Coherent continuous wave L-band (e.g., 1067 MHz) signal<br />&bull; Coherent continuous wave S-band (&gt;2 GHz) signal</p>
<p>The Government is also interested in responses containing approaches/ideas/designs that might provide additional value that could include modulation of the continuous wave signals.</p>
<p>To mitigate interference issues with a potentially co-manifested radio occultation sensor, the L-band frequency should be selected to avoid the Global Navigation Satellite Signal (GNSS) bands (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS) and particular care should be taken in the instrument design to ensure that no spurious emissions in the GNSS bands exist. While this RFI is focused on a space-based transmitter, the Government understands that the capabilities of potential ground receivers are a factor in the RF beacon flight article design. Responses to this RFI should include a discussion of the assumptions made relative to the ground-based component of the transmitter-receiver system. Furthermore, the implications of any proposed waveforms on the complexity of the ground-based receiver systems required to exploit the transmitted signals should be discussed.</p>
<p>The Government is requesting responses from respondents with established manufacturing processes and equipment for producing the desired RF beacon flight articles. The Government is seeking responses that demonstrate technology and design maturity along with the associated manufacturing readiness. The respondent should provide Level II cost and delivery schedule estimates by fiscal year as well as their assumptions associated with providing:</p>
<p>&bull; Seven (7) RF beacon flight articles<br />&bull; One (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU)<br />&bull; One (1) power and data interface simulator<br />&bull; Ground Support Equipment (GSE)<br />&bull; Space vehicle integration and test support<br />&bull; Controlled environment storage option - Priced by month<br />&bull; Packaging and shipping containers <br />&bull; Launch and early operations anomaly support</p>
<p>The required funding profile across the fiscal years involved to meet the program schedule should be provided.</p>
<p>The following Government assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation:</p>
<p>1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level and responders may also include figures from various confidence levels, with appropriate justification;<br />2. Solutions will be low risk by using high TRL components (i.e. minimum of TRL 6), the Government is willing to assess lower TRL with appropriate justification;<br />3. No Government facilities or property will be provided;<br />4. Anticipated contract award during 4th quarter Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2012;<br />5. Sensor delivery dates: (a) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) 4th quarter GFY 2013; (b) First RF beacon flight article 1st quarter GFY 2014; (c) Remaining 6 RF beacon flight articles 2nd quarter GFY 2014;<br />6. Spacecraft integration/pre-launch support: through launch in 4th quarter GFY 2015;<br />7. Estimate storage option based on a monthly rate;<br />8. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level possible;<br />9. Program level costs will include Systems Engineering, Program Management, Design, Manufacturing, Integration, Assembly and Test support, etc;<br />10. For contract type recommendations see Section 5.</p>
<p>Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the Government is only seeking information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>In your approach/responses please include the following, as well:</p>
<p>&bull; Discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations<br />&bull; Information pertaining to utilization of small business subcontractor/s, if applicable.</p>
<p>16e. Desired Technical Goals:</p>
<p>The RF beacon flight article should have a reliability of 95% probability of success (Ps) for the 5-year mission life. The altitude of the spacecraft carrying the RF beacon flight article will be 840 km or less. The command interface to the host spacecraft will be RS422. Measurement goals for TEC and scintillation measurements are provided in the following bullets. Scintillation measurement goals apply at each of the RF beacon flight article frequencies.</p>
<p>&bull; Measurement: Slant Path TEC; Measurement Range: 0-1000 TEC; Measurement Accuracy: 0.01/3.0 TEC (relative/absolute); Absolute TEC measurements are to be considered an objective requirement.<br />&bull; Measurement: Scintillation Indices; Measurement Range: S4: 0-1.5 and &sigma;&phi;: 0-1 radians; Measurement Accuracy: S4: 0.05 and &sigma;&phi;: 0.05 radians</p>
<p>The Government is interested in limiting the size, weight and power (SWaP) of the RF beacon flight article as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; &lt;5.0 kg (electronics and antenna included)<br />&bull; &lt;14 W<br />&bull; Electronics volume &lt;15&times;8&times;6 cm</p>
<p>Responses that suggest excursions outside of the SWaP limits, or which do not fully meet the measurements goals, are still of interest, but should include discussions of the rationale and relevant technical trades involved.</p>
<p>16f. Sample Response Outline:</p>
<p>The following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and to structure the responses for ease of analysis by the Government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Technological Alternatives</p>
<p>Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives (3-5 pages per alternative).</p>
<p>Section 2 - Feasibility Assessment</p>
<p>Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks (1 page per alternative).</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost and Schedule Estimates</p>
<p>Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk. Responders may also include figures from various confidence levels, with appropriate justification (2-3 pages).<br />The assumptions in paragraph 16d may be used for cost and schedule estimation.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Corporate Expertise</p>
<p>Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and any other information you deem relevant. Responses from small and small disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.</p>
<p>Please describe current and relevant experience that relates to the purpose of this RFI, including management and operations approach, and any lessons learned (3-5 page count).</p>
<p>Section 5 - Additional Materials</p>
<p>Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussions you deem appropriate. Include any recommended structure of the requirements in the event the Government plans to issue an RFP. Also, current department policy requires the use of Fixed Price (FP) contracts to the maximum extent possible. Please include in your response how your company could accomplish this effort under a FFP contract and assess the challenges, constraints, and risks that could arise from this contract type.</p>

The cartridge is completely inert and simulates a loaded round of 40mm HE ammunition in size, shape, and weight. This fixed round is a one piece solid aluminum round. There is no separate cartridge case. Four grooves allow easy repositioning of M16A2 link after being cycled through the weapon. There is a hole in the base to prevent damage to the firing pin. The entire round is gold in color.  Each MK19 is allowed one 10-round belt (DODAC B472), which is packed in an M2A1 metal box.<BR><BR>Response date of February 25, 2011 remains unchanged.

NOTE: For responses which include "CLASSIFIED" information, contact the Government via laurence.toomey@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION:<BR><BR>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<BR><BR>4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS".<BR><BR>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.

<DESC>1. INTRODUCTION <br />The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5) is soliciting technical/cost proposals for research and development support in technologies that are applicable to Communications Relay, Electro-Optical (EO), Radio Frequency (RF), Acoustic Sensors, Manned and Unmanned Airborne Payloads, Persistent Surveillance Technologies, Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS), and Special Sensor Systems for Navy Aircraft and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). Technologies proposed should emphasize rapid development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E), and technology insertion to the warfighter.
<p>2. BACKGROUND <br />The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5) develops advanced sensors (Acoustics, EO, Radar, Magnetics, and other special sensors) and systems. The purpose of these sensors and surveillance systems is to support a variety of Aviation missions including Air-Under-Sea-Warfare (USW), Airborne Strike, Air Warfare, Counter-Air, Close Air Support and Interdiction, Defense Suppression, Electronic Attack, Naval Warfare and Amphibious Strike, and Anti-Surface Warfare. Most of the sensors will be air deployed (via manned or unmanned aircraft), but ground, surface and undersea deployable sensors will also be included when mission driven.<br /><br />This BAA not only includes the sensors, sensor data processing and sensors systems, but mathematical modeling of the sensor, communication techniques between the sensors and/or platforms, interfaces, the fusion and exploitation of multi-sensor data, and any other technique to develop advanced capabilities and to reduce the cost of transitioning sensors technologies into the fleet. Furthermore, the BAA shall cover development and/or analysis of related sensors air, sea and land clutter detection models using relevant sensor data.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SHOULD REVIEW THE ATTACHED BAA DOCUMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION.<br /><br />The BAA document can also be found on the NAVAIR Doing Business Website:&nbsp; http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=OpenSolicitations<br /><br />The original document package posted is in Microsoft Word 2007 format.&nbsp; A second file has been posted in Microsoft Word 2003 format.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an unrestricted basis a requirement for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services in support of the Forces Surveillance Support Center (FSSC) Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) System.  The ROTHR System is a radar system that detects and tracks drug trafficking activities in Northern South American and Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico basins.  It is used by the Navy, North American Defense (NORAD), Customs, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and other national security agencies.  ROTHR Systems are located in Virginia, Texas, and Puerto Rico.  The Contractor shall operate, maintain, and support the ROTHR Systems 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
  Additionally, the effort includes systems engineering, engineering change proposal preparation and analysis, failure analysis, configuration management, preparation, installation and testing of field change kits, logistics support, training, and repair and refurbishment services.  This requirement presents several challenges to the Contractor including having to work with a mature system, dealing with parts obsolescence, and the Government does not possess the Level III technical data associated with this unique legacy system.  See Numbered Note 26.

A DRAFT of the possible Request for Proposals (RFP) is hereby attached for information/planning purposes only.  This is only a DRAFT solicitation and is subject to change.
  Please submit any and all questions/comments regarding this DRAFT RFP through email to caitlin.sontowski@navy.mil.

<DESC>CHANGE: NAICS CODE IS 236220, SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD IS $33,500,000.00<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors for the design and construction of a new parking garage (minimum 400 spaces) for the VABHS facility in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts next to the existing parking garage in what is now a surface parking lot. The existing precast concrete parking garage was constructed to the north of the proposed site in 1996 and contains 3 sloped levels with approximately 90 parking spaces per level. The work of this project also includes modifications to the existing parking garage, associated exterior site improvements, and security enhancements for access to the parking garage. The work is located at an active VA hospital with both in-patient and out-patient functions. Impact to hospital operations must be kept to a minimum and carefully coordinated with the Contracting Officer and hospital staff.<BR><BR>The existing parking garage is located within a known area of release of oil and hazardous material that is subject to the regulations of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP). During construction of the existing parking garage in 1996, chemical analysis identified polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), and other compounds in excess of MCP reportable concentrations. Ultimately, a Notice of Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) was recorded with the Suffolk County Registry of Deeds on July 23, 2007. To meet the AUL obligations, the DB Contractor must complete a Soil Management Plan and applicable MCP requirements under the direction of a qualified Licensed Site Professional (LSP) in the design and construction of this new parking garage.<BR><BR>The solicitation will be available on or about February 25, 2011 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (go to http:/fbo.gov and register under Vendor/Citizen). Amendments, if any, to his solicitation will be made available at the http:/www.fbo.gov website. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List.<BR><BR>This procurement is set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms. The estimated cost of the contract is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The applicable NAICS code is 236220 with a Small Business Size Standard of $33,500,000. Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a proposal to be considered by the New England District. <BR>

<DESC><p>UPDATE 18 (17 February 2011)<br /><br />The purpose this update is to provide Amendment 6 and three amended RFP attachments.&nbsp; These documents are located&nbsp;in the lower-right hand side of this page.<br /><br />As described in Amendment 6, the three attachments have been amended as follows: <br /><br />1.) Attachment 3B - A formula error has been fixed.<br /><br />The version of Attachment 3B attached to this amendment shall be used by offerors submitting Domain 2 proposals.<br /><br />2.) Attachment 4 - Typographical errors have been fixed.<br /><br />3.) Attachment 10 - References have been corrected.<br /><br />The RFP and all other RFP attachments are unchanged.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE 17 (11 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the TABSS Q+A Addendum Matrix. It is located in the lower-right hand side of this page.</p>
<p>The Q+A Addendum Matrix has two parts. The first part consists of questions that were received before the TABSS question due date but were accidentally left off of the original TABSS Q+A Matrix. The second part consists of clarifications regarding certain questions from the original TABSS Q+A Matrix.</p>
<p>The government will accept no further questions. Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix will be updated in the future. In the event of a discrepancy between either matrix and the amended RFP, the amended RFP governs.</p>
<p>Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix are included in any of the TABSS amendments. They are provided as guidance to offerors.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.</p>
<p>UPDATE 16 (10 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the amended RFP and RFP attachments. Of particular note is the amended Attachment 10, "Labor Category Descriptions and Qualifications Matrix," along with the new Attachment 11, "Annual Small Business Subcontracting Compliance Report."</p>
<p>Two copies of the RFP are being provided, an "informational" copy with highlighting and a "conformed" copy without highlighting. In the informational copy, all new changes to the RFP have been highlighted in turquoise. Changes made via Amendment 4 are highlighted in yellow. The content of the two RFPs (both informational and conformed) is identical. Please use the conformed copy in the future.</p>
<p>Attachments that have been changed since Amendment 4 are updated per the descriptions on the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5. Any attachment not mentioned in the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5 is unchanged. However, all attachments are included with this update for offerors' reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the amended RFP, to reiterate:</p>
<p>(1) Paper copies of proposals are required. Please see Sections L-5 and L-6 of the amended RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(2) Labor category descriptions are provided in the amended Attachment 10. Offerors should meet those stated requirements</p>
<p>(3) For offerors' acknowledgement of amendments, please see Section L-8 of the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluation Factor 3, "Socio-economic Considerations," has been significantly amended. Please see Sections L and M of the RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(5) For the $250 contractual minimum, this amount will be obligated to each contract at the time of award. It will not be provided as consideration for the contractor's requirement to attend the post-award conference. Travel expenses for post-award conferences are the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>(6) The proposal due date is extended until 3 PM Eastern Standard Time on 03/02/2011.</p>

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

Reno, NV - Upgrade of Building 1 Seismic, Life Safety, Utility Corrections and Expand Clinical Services, Project Number 654-083.
POC Selection Process:  Katherine Volpe, Contracting Officer, 707-562-8399; 
POC Scope: William Ulibarri, Project Manager, 707-562-8414.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking interested firms that are classified under one or more of the following small business programs: (1) Section 8(a), (2) HUB Zone, (3) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), (4) Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), (5) Service-Disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and/or (6) Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB). The interested firms shall be architects or architect/engineer firms with experience in the planning and design of renovating hospitals, large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, or similar complex healthcare projects and capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, and geotechnical investigation and surveying.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 541310.

Scope:
This project will correct potentially hazardous seismic, life safety and infrastructure deficiencies, as well as consolidate outpatient programs and clinical research into a state of the art treatment facility located at the VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System's Reno campus.  The proposed project will accomplish renovation of approximately 90% of Building 1, with the exclusion of the major utility and life safety improvements which were completed within the last 3 years.  The proposed project would provide the following upgrades in Building 1 which is approximately 138,007 square feet.

1.  Seismic upgrades to reduce/eliminate the possibility of catastrophic failure of the 60+ year old building should a significant seismic event occur.
2.  Correct life safety and infrastructure deficiencies.
3.  Substantially improve building energy efficiencies.

In addition, this project will construct a 30,000 square foot clinical expansion to correct space deficiencies identified through the Capitol Asset Inventory and Strategic Capitol Investment Plan.  The Research Program would be increased by approximately 5,000 square feet as part of this project.  The following programs will be impacted and will benefit from the proposed project: Mental Health, Dental, Compensation and Pension,  Audiology, Patient Admissions and Testing, Surgical Service, Quality Management, Veterans Service Offices, Warehouse, Voluntary Services, Veterans Eligibility Center, Geriatrics and Extended Care, Dietetics, In-patient Kitchen, Morgue, Laboratory and Pathology Services, Research, Surgical Service, Medical Service, Ambulatory Care (Patient Centered Medical Home), OEF/OIF, and Women's Health Clinic.  The addition has been tentatively located at the east side of Building 12.  The exact location will be determined after all access and adjacencies have been analyzed by an Architect to determine the ideal location.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities.  The space will be in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.

The campus is residentially landlocked with a limited footprint.
 
At this time it is anticipated that the seismic upgrade and expansion of Building 1, will follow the design-bid-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method.

The contract may include options for: design development documents, construction documents, construction period services, site visits, and other professional services.

The completed project will be required to be LEED Silver certified.  Renewable energy systems will be required as part of this project.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on cost and scope management capabilities and previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the proposed Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures.   In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  All VA design guides and requirements can be found online at:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/. 

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.

Applicants must have an established working office within 150 miles of Reno, Nevada and be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of Nevada.  Preference will be given to firms with working offices capable of performing all design work within 150 miles of the VA Sierra Nevada Healthcare System, 1000 Locust Street, Reno, Nevada 89502.

<DESC>As commercial market forces are driving Integrated Circuit (IC) foundries offshore, the U.S. government is increasingly becoming concerned with the integrity of electronics procured from such offshore, uncontrolled facilities. Similarly, the government is intensely interested in the useful lifespan of these components. DARPA's Microelectronics Technology Office is investigating methods of validating the functionality and reliability of ICs under the Integrity and Reliability in Integrated Circuits (IRIS) program to address this issue. The Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California (USC/ISI) proposes to aid the government in performing research in this area by supplying benchmark Test Articles (TAs) to better focus and drive the results of the IRIS program. <br />Over the course of two Phases, the ITAG (IRIS Test Article Generation) project will deliver test articles for Technical Areas 1, 3, and 4a of the IRIS program. These test articles may be comprised of ASIC hardware devices, ASIC design files, or FPGA design files, as mandated by the targeted Technical Area. At the government's direction, the test articles will be delivered to the IRIS contractor community. <br />

Justification and approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 18, Northern Arizona VA Health Care System, Prescott Vet Center.

2.	 Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a temporary PO to cover Readjustment Counseling services until a long term contract can be put in place.

3.	Description of Supplies and Services:  This service is to provide readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans and their families located in Coconino County. 

Temporary PO to cover services from February 1, 2011 through July 31, 2011; with a 6-month option to further extend through NLT January 31, 2012.

4.	 Statutory Authority:

(  ) a.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements;
(X) b.  Unusual and compelling urgency;
(  ) c.  Industrial mobilization, engineering, developmental or research capability, or expert services;
(  ) d.  International agreement;
(  ) e.  Authorized or required by statute;
(  ) f.  National security; or
(  ) g.  Public interest

5.	 Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  These services are necessary to continue veteran care.  Many veterans that utilize this service are in the middle of very sensitive counseling and an interruption in that service could be detrimental to the progress already made, having a profound effect on their already fragile mental status.

6.	 Actions to Promote Competition:  A long term contract is being pursued at this time.  

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The estimated and anticipated price to the Government is $6,500.00 for this six month period.  The costs per hour for individual and Family visits will be $80.00/hr for Ph.D.s, $70.00/hr for LCSW, $70.00/hr for unlicensed (supervised) Social Workers.  The cost for group therapy will be $40.00/hr per client for Ph.D.s, $35.00 per/hr per client for LCSW, and $35.00/hr for (supervised) Unlicensed Social Workers.  According to Market Research performed the medium salary for PhDs is $90.00/hr.

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  completed and submitted 11/15/2010.

9.	Other Considerations:  The incumbent for this contract has done an outstanding job dealing with the needs of our veterans and their families for over 10 years.

10.	 Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:  A new, competitive contract is being performed for a long term solution.

11.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

_//Signed//________	____01/27/2011____
Catherine Brinnon 					

12.	 Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304

a.	 Contracting Officers Certification:  I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

_//Signed//________	____01/27/2011____
Sheila Kiker

b.	 Acquisition Managers Review and Approval:  I have reviewed the foregoing justification and find it to be complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and recommend approval for other than full and open competition.
