<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge have a requirement for Russian Olive Eradication, NAICS 541320, Small Business Size Standard $5,000,000 Contractor will treat Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia L.) through the use of foliar and injection application techniques (see Application Methods section) on approximately 1,200 acres.  Infestations are widespread and sporadic throughout the treatment area.  Tree sizes vary from seedlings to mature trees.  This project will be very labor intensive, requiring hand treatment of individual plants. Russian olive is a fast growing tree of moderate size.  Originally introduced as an ornamental shade tree, it provides excellent habitat cover but becomes a serious weed problem in low-lying pastures, meadows, and waterways.  Russian olive spread onto refuge lands from neighboring meadows following the flooding of Malheur Lake in the 1980s.  It is a prolific seed producer and has spread at an alarming rate in the last 10 years. Solicitation closes 9/6/2007 at 4:00 pm.

DS has selected Dell servers as the standard server platform for the entire Bureau of Diplomatic Security IT enterprise. Please note that these are NOT personal computers, these are major infrastructure appliances used throughout the Bureau’s enterprise and located at different buildings across the United States.  The use of name brand is essential to the Government’s requirements for Department of State DS server consolidation and standardization.    This selection was approved by the DS ITCCB as required by 5 FAM 862.1(b).  By standardizing on Dell servers, DS has realized approximately a 20% savings in the form of Dell Systems Management (central management of enterprise Dell servers and storage devices), component commonality (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), maintenance and warranty costs, support personnel skill sets requirements and investment protection.  NOTE:  Any hardware vendor chosen other than Dell would require additional server monitoring software and hardware as DS currently only has the means to monitor and administer (from a lights out perspective) is the Dell DRAC enabled hardware; additional maintenance agreements; additional skill sets (personnel) and additional spare parts.   The Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the Department of State has a requirement for additional Dell 2950 and 1950 servers to further consolidate and standardize the enterprise.  The Dell servers are all being purchased with the same baseline configuration.  This configuration will support all known and foreseen needs in the enterprise, including web, Oracle, Exchange, Terminal, Print, and Blackberry servers.  These additional servers will be in addition to the servers that have already been purchased for the existing enterprise.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.DS identified multiple vendors for the Dell 2950 and 1950 Servers to seek best value pricing. Dell manufacturing provides compatibility and availability of the units, essential to meet the Agency’s requirements.  It is important to note that any vendor who sells Dell servers can provide these products.<BR><BR>

(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>This justification and approval is for a name brand justification for Brocade switches.  The use of name brand is essential to the Government’s requirements for Department of State DS to extend its fiber channel storage connectivity. DS currently has these devices and needs to ensure the new devices can be intermixed with the existing via ISL.  This device was approved by the DS ITCCB as required by 5 FAM 862.1(b). The Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the Department of State has a requirement to extend the communication abilities of its fiber channel network. Other vendors due produce fiber channel switches and would be fine if not being connected or chained together. These devices must be capable of directly connecting and sharing resource allocations.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Business Management Division intends to add a one-year option period, in the amount of $30,017.00, to Purchase Order DE-AF01-05IM00122 with Reuters America LLC, of Norristown, Pennsylvania. This action is for upgraded software access entitled, â€œReuters Trader for Commodities (RTC C&E) Servicesâ€ for the period October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008.  The initial award date was July 21, 2005. The extension will increase the current Purchase Order Amount from $75,890.00 to $105,907.00. The services being acquired will allow DOE authorized users to access real-time and historical data on energy via international news sources, detailed real-time and historical pricing from commodities and energy futures exchanges world-wide, backed up by real-time and historical data on cash prices.  In addition, the subscription service will allow DOE users access to global/regional energy company equity prices and details, along with Metals and agri-markets data. This one-year option period is necessary because these services are available only from Reuterâ€™s America LLC and no other type for services are known to be available that will meet the needs of the DOE who needs to be informed and have an accurate and current/real-time overview of the national and international energy situation. This existing knowledge and experience capability is critical to the mission of the Office of Deputy Secretary for International Energy Policy and Energy Information Administration.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  NRL will negotiate with Qwest Govrnment Services, Inc, for dark fiber access. This network will interconnect a number of Department of Defense R&D agencies and other network research activities over a dedicated (exclusive use) dark fiber infrastructure across approximately 200 miles.  The infrastructure requires TruWave/AllWave (or equal) cable with no connectorization except at the end locations (and selected way points).  Specific locations include the Naval Research Laboratory (Washington, DC), Laboratory for Telecommunications Sciences (College Park, MD), Laboratory for Physical Sciences (College Park, MD), Army Research Laboratory (Adelphi, MD), Fort George Meade (MD), Defense Information Systems Agency (Bailey?s Crossroads, VA), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arlington, VA), University of Maryland (College Park, MD), George Washington University (Washington, DC), Eckington POP (Washington, DC) and Tysons Corner POP (Tysons Corner, VA). The resulting contract will include options that may extend the period of performance up to twenty years.  This network must become operational by 30 September 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis with L3 Communications, Essco for the purchase of a Circularly Poarized Antenna Feed, retrofitted for the DATRON 20 foot antenna located at NRL?s Blossum Point Field Site in Welcome Maryland.. This effort provides the existing Datron 20 foot antenna with an additional feed assembly to increase the frequency range to include the Universal S-band frequencies.  The Daltron 20 foot antenna currently in place was built and installed by L3 Communications Essco, therefore they have all the relevant system and subsystem experts to make informed decisions quickly and without causing extensive modification or damaging existing software.  To meet the compatibility requirement it is necessary for the contractor to be familiar with the design and operation of the existing Datron Antenna System. Because L3 Communications Essco designed and built the Datron System, they are the sole contractor with the knowledge necessary to fulfill this requirement.  If another contractor were to provide the hardware this would require extensive training on the system which would have a dramatic increase on the price and leadtime of the effort. Responses to this notice of intent to negotiate L3 Communications should be submitted no later than 15 days from the date of the synopsis.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure  Precipitation Static Test Sets with the capability of pinpointing airframe bonding issues on the P-3, E-6, and EA-6B aircraft platforms. The current P-STAT Test Sets are used by the Navy for pin-pointing the areas prone to P-Static problems such as:  Fin Caps, Tail Cones, Structural Plates, Antenna Mounting, Inspection Panels, Bonding Straps, Radomes, etc.

The objectives for this procurement are to provide the Navy with portable, ruggedized, lightweight P-STAT Test Sets while satisfying aircraft maintenance needs with a modified commercial variant of the current P-STAT Test Set. The new P-STAT Test Set shall be a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified COTS item.

The P-STAT Test Set shall be capable of inducing a localized, high voltage static charge onto the outer skin of the aircraft to simulate actual atmospheric precipitation conditions that occur during aircraft flight. The Test Set shall also be capable of inducing three types of electrical discharge generated by problem areas on the aircraft: Metal-to-Metal Arcing/Sparking, Corona Discharge, and Streamering Effects. The Test Set shall be capable of charging windshields, radomes, and other non-metal surfaces, as well as charging isolated metal sections. Based on the high voltage produced by the P-STAT Test Set, risk of shock or electrocution is a primary concern. The procurement of a common piece of support equipment will allow for configuration control and common operation practices, as well as logistics support.  

The Government intends to procure up to a maximum of (50) P-STAT Test Sets over the life of the contract. The first (3) P-STAT Test Sets shall be pilot production units procured under the first delivery order under an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract along with associated technical and logistics data and training. Delivery of the (3) pilot production units and associated technical and logistics data and training will take place within 330 days after date of delivery order award. The pilot production units shall be used for pilot production testing and supportability evaluation/approval testing. Upon completion of contractor pilot production testing and Government suitability/supportability evaluation, up to a maximum of (47) production units may be procured under one or more delivery orders. Delivery of the production units and associated technical and logistics data will take place within 6 months after date of delivery order award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm-fixed price effort.

The contractor shall organize, coordinate, and control all program activities to ensure compliance with the contract requirements and timely delivery of the required products and services. The contractor shall provide necessary system engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the SOW and the Performance Specification.

The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website located at http://www.navair.navy.mil on or about 28 FEBRUARY 2007. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The point of contact is: James W. Maxwell, phone: (732) 323-4589, FAX: (732) 323-2359, email: james.w.maxwell@navy.mil.

<DESC>**********PLEASE CONTACT MARY BRINKLEY ONLY FOR TECHNICAL OR QUOTE ISSUES.  MARY BRINKLEY CONTACT INFORMATION IS IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITAITON********** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for LMS S/W Software Maintenance 2/1/2008 2008 through 1/31/2009.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the software maintenance from LMS North America. NASA/MSFC has a requirement for LMS S/W Software Maintenance from 2/1/2008 through 1/31/2009.   Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  Because of proprietary copyright held LMS North America, the software maintenance requested is not available from any other source.  Review of current technical literature substantiates that only LMS retains the unique ability to make source code changes for program updates and maintenance corrections for the existing JP4.2 Software. 2.  It would be impractical to go to full and open competition for replacement software since it would duplicate an initial cost rate to the Government. Recent cost studies of alternate sources estimated that first year cost average more than 5 times the cost of a follow-up maintenance contract. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Mary.M.Brinkley@nasa.gov, or fax to 256 544-4401 no later 4:30 p.m. local time on September 5, 2007.

<DESC>NAICS Code:  541110.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ).  The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Duane Morris, LLP, for continuation of legal services currently being provided under an existing contract (Contract OFHEO2005-07C) and incorporation of changes to the scope of work.  Duane Morris, LLP, is currently providing legal support services in connection with the ongoing investigation, examination, and administrative enforcement actions and judicial proceedings of a Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE)--the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae).  The anticipated change is to provide funding in support of the services provided in connection with Fannie Mae and to increase the scope to include these same services in support of the other GSE--the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).  This synopsis is required because the anticipated changes are outside the scope of the existing contract based on including work associated with Freddie Mac under the contract as well as the current dollar value of the contract.  Duane Morris, LLP, is the only contractor with the expertise to provide these services based on their unique knowledge and experience in the factual and legal background in these cases as well as OFHEO's data systems and business processes, which are necessary in order to perform the legal work required by OFHEO and to meet the trial schedules and discovery and prehearing deadlines in these cases.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying OFHEO's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses must be submitted in writing to Ms. Janice L. Uthe, Contracting Officer, at janice.uthe@ofheo.gov.  A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Bacteriology and Mycology Branch (BMB) of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by Focus Technologies, Inc. under NIAID Contract N01-AI-95359.  This procedure is being competed using full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about February 16, 2007, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 1.35 FTEs.  The current NARSA contract established a repository of staphylococcal strains important to public health and research.  This repository of staphylococcal isolates with associated historical case information is available to researchers to use to the fullest potential to increase knowledge and affect prudent clinical management approaches for minimizing antimicrobial resistance.  NARSA also includes a website www.narsa.net and communication capacity to link basic scientists, epidemiologists, clinical microbiologists, and clinicians working in the area of staphylococcal diseases and antibiotic resistance, thereby encouraging collaborative research across disciplines of science, public health and medicine.  Other NARSA activities include strain characterization; establishment and maintenance of a registry of S. aureus case information; the evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods; establishment of a NARSA Scientific Working Group to provide guidance and oversight of NARSA activities; and coordination of annual investigator meetings which is open to any interested party. The NARSA network of investigators currently consists of 190 NARSA Affiliate Members (researchers approved to order NARSA strains) and 71 NARSA Core Members (researchers receiving NIAID grant/contract support to study S. aureus). At present, the NARSA repository maintains 216 strains, and ships approximately 100 samples monthly, with one-third shipped abroad.  Oracle databases store the information for the NARSA Strain Repository, the NARSA Case-History Registry, and NARSA membership information. At the time of the first contract, there was no systematic collection and distribution system for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. NARSA has filled this gap and it is important to maintain and update this resource for the research community.  Researchers will continue to need ready and reliable access to well characterized isolates as well as an ability to easily communicate and interact with other researchers.  The original NARSA repository collected isolates of interest for S. aureus fully resistant to vancomycin (VRSA); however, in the contract to be awarded under this RFP, the repository will collect and distribute isolates of clinical, public health and research importance to antibiotic resistance in S. aureus.  The repository will also acquire and distribute other reagents which the Scientific Working Group deem helpful to the research community in advancing research on antibiotic resistant S. aureus. This RFP will be available electronically on/about February 7, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<SUBJECT>A -- KC-10 Aircraft Modernization Program (AMP)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FA862507KC10AMP
<CONTACT>James Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, Phone 937-255-2025, Fax 937-255-3466, Email james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center?s (ASC) 653d Aeronautical Systems Squadron (653 AESS), 516th Aeronautical Systems Wing (516 AESW), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is submitting a Pre-solicitation Notice for the KC-10 Aircraft Modernization Program (AMP).

FOR PLANNING PURPOSES

The purpose of this notice is to provide industry with information about the status of the KC-10 Aircraft Modernization Program (AMP).  The government awarded five Concept Refinement Study (CRS) contracts in 2006 to gain a better understanding of the marketplace for the modernization requirements for the KC-10.  Analysis of the CRS findings, combined with other research, indicated acquisition of the full suite of KC-10 modernization requirements contemplated by the AMP was beyond the reach of available funding.


The Air Force is now pursuing a reduced-scope program focusing on the most urgent modernization need of the KC-10 fleet ? upgrading its Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) capability.  The re-scoped program will be renamed the KC-10 Aircraft Extension Program (AEP).

The Air Force anticipates the AEP program will be designated Acquisition Category (ACAT) level I.  Given the additional review/approval requirements of this ACAT level, the Air Force projects the following contract milestones. The milestones may be advanced if internal reviews/approvals are able to be accelerated.
Draft Request for Proposal release - 2Q CY 2009
Final Request for Proposal release ? 4Q CY 2009
Proposal submissions ? 1Q CY 2010
Contract Award ? 1Q CY 2011

REQUIREMENT          

The Air Force presently operates 59 KC-10 aerial refueling tanker aircraft.  These aircraft are approaching 25 years of age and require significant modernization to keep them viable through FY45.  The KC-10 AEP is the first major step in this modernization process.  The AEP will upgrade the KC-10 fleet to Federal Aviation Administration and International Civil Aviation Organization standards enabling full access to worldwide civil and military airspace.  This capability is generically described as CNS/ATM.

In order to enable future modernizations, the AEP will replace the analog flight deck with a digital one that features modular open-system approaches (MOSA).  All areas of the flight deck affected by the AEP upgrades must also address Force Protection requirements (meaning the ability of crewmembers to operate the KC-10 systems while using Air Force-issued chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protective gear).  The KC-10 AEP will also include a requirement for the development and delivery of a high-fidelity system integration laboratory.  This laboratory will be utilized by the successful AEP contractor to facilitate software integration issues.

It is contemplated that any solicitation for the KC-10 AEP will be structured to allow potential offerors to highlight the modular, open-system aspects of their proposals that will allow future KC-10 modernization such as: critical obsolescence mitigation; real-time information in the cockpit; night-vision imaging system compatibility and survivability.

The KC-10 AEP will update the deployed KC-10 Aircrew Training System (hardware and courseware) to the AEP configuration.  The KC-10 AEP will also facilitate upgrade of existing KC-10 on-aircraft maintenance procedures.

ACQUISITION STRATEGY

The 653d AESS is developing an acquisition strategy for the KC-10 AEP that utilizes a single contract encompassing System Design and Development (SDD), Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP), and Full-Rate Production (FRP).  LRIP and Full-Rate Production will be accommodated via priced contract options.

GENERAL INFORMATION     

The government may issue Requests for Information on the FedBizOpps webpage (http://www.fbo.gov) for elements of the solicitation prior to releasing Draft and Final RFPs.  Potential foreign prime contractors are advised that no determination has yet been made on any restrictions pursuant to AFFARS 5305.204. 

This pre-solicitation announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation (Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP)).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice.  This notice is for information and planning purposes only.  The Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with any documentation or communication submitted in response to this notice.  Any submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  Therefore, any information that is deemed proprietary should not be submitted.  Questions or comments to this notice should be addressed to the Contracting Officer.

If a KC-10 AEP RFP is later released, a Notice of Contract Action will be published at least 15 days prior.  This announcement represents the 653d AESS? initial acquisition strategy for the KC-10 AEP.  The government reserves the right to change any or all of the assumptions outlined herein in the draft and final Request for Proposals.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) has a requirement for a telephonic smoking cessation program to decrease the rate of smoking for veterans, and  intends to issue a full and open competitive unrestricted solicitation. VAPHS serves approximately 55,000 veterans, and many veterans who use the system are unable to attend face-to-face smoking counseling because of travel distance or time constraints and therefore require an intense intervention delivered via telephone counseling. Although it is known that only a minority of smokers quit tobacco permanently after attempting to quit, VAPHS seeks a vendor who can provide strong evidence of high one-year quite rates from a smoking cessation intervention so as to maximize the value of the contract. Specific requirements of the contractor are as follows: 1. Ability to provide intense smoking cessation counseling via the telephone to a large population of smokers. 2. Ability to initiate the program throughout the healthcare system within 2 months of award of the contract. 3. Capable of assessing degree of nicotine dependence and making recommendation about pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. 4. Extensive experience in smoking cessation telephonic interventions that would indicate a high chance of success with patients, many of whom who have smoked for many years 5. Evidence of prior success showing smoking cessation one year quit rates that exceed 20%. Evidence of this success should include counting all smokers who enter counseling in the denominator and those who report being totally tobacco free 1 year later as the numerator (also known as intent to treat). Evidence of success should be available in scientific publications based on randomized controlled trials by authors who conducted investigations with the vendor, such that there is high confidence that the rate of tobacco cessation claimed is accurate and conclusions about the success of the program is valid. 6. Ability and track record of ability to work with a large complex geographically disperse organization 7. Counselors who have competency in providing counseling to economically disadvantaged populations and to a population with high prevalence of racial minorities. 8. A well developed approach and evidence of success in recruiting smokers to make a quit attempt with the assistance of telephonic counseling 9. Willingness to document smoking counseling in the VA electronic medical record system. 10. Ability to track quit rates on an ongoing basis and provides frequent data to the VAPHS regarding the number of enrolled patients and employees, and quit rates during the program, at the end of counseling, and after 1 year. Significant interactive discussion&quot; between the vendor's counselors and veterans are required. The contract period is expected to be December 1, 2007 with four (4) one-year option periods. The proposed contract will be a firm-fixed priced contract to the offeror whose quote provides the best value to the Government. The Contractor shall provide in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, laws, and ordinances, and in accordance with the specifications outlined in the solicitation, for smoking cessation services to perform the requirements of this contract. The solicitation will be made available on or about September 17, 2007, and the date for receipt of proposals is October 15, 2007. Offerors are advised that they are responsible for obtaining amendments. Requests for hard copy solicitation must be in writing to the Contracting Officer at the VAPHS and accompanied by a check for $5.00 made out to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce(DOC), National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, Environmental Conservation  Division located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with the University of Washington in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c)(1) only one responsible source. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
The University will provide support for a regional symposium on geoduck and shellfish, and support for development of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) and pathogen newsletter. Provide support to convene a meeting of Pacific Northwest stakeholders and constituents, and support for a student research fellow for aquaculture.  One goal of NOAA Fisheries and WSG is to restore and enhance natural and cultured stocks of fish and shellfish to support biodiversity and sustainable use. Recently, cultured seafood has become an emerging issue due, in part, to questions of quality (and safety) of imported seafood to U.S. markets. Recently, the National Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2007 is being considered by the Congress and would provide important tools to foster an environmentally and economically sustainable marine aquaculture industry in the United States if passed. In the Pacific Northwest, information gathering to learn the current perception of both industry and consumers on aquaculture is needed for future planning. A student research fellow is needed to coordinate this information gathering on aquaculture perception so that we are prepared to move forward on an emerging aquaculture issue.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is a simplified acquisition action with an estimated value of less than $100,000.00.     ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.     After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.     For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.     In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505. All contractors are also required to complete online Representations and Certifications at HTTP://ORCA.BPN.GOV.

<DESC>GSA National Capital Region SFO 07-029 - WAREHOUSE SPACE NEEDED - U.S. GOVERNMENT will seek to satisfy new and/or succeeding WAREHOUSE LEASE REQUIREMENTS through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program during the month of October.  The first offer submission ?Open Period? will be SEPTEMBER 1, 2007 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 14, 2007.  The September Open Period will be the first opportunity offerors will have to submit an offer to the Government for warehouse space using the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program.  The September Open Period and resulting inventory of offers will be treated as a "dry run", meaning no actual lease awards will be made during September.  However, the September dry run will function as an important opportunity for offerors to familiarize themselves with the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program for warehouse, as well as allowing the Government to complete final testing and verification of the software to ensure proper function.  The October Open Period (October 1-7) will result in a database of offers which is actually used for lease awards during that month, and the process will repeat itself on a monthly basis thereafter.   REQUIREMENTS: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) is a new web application enabling the electronic offering of building space for lease to the Federal Government.  This web application is located at the following internet address:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  In order to access this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the "Register to offer space" link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using the AAAP.  Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the open period will start on the 1st of the month and end on the 7th of the month, except months in which new SFOs are posted, in which case the last day of the open period will typically be the 14th of the month.  The official opening time and closing time for each offer period will be established on the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) website at aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  The U. S. Government is seeking to lease, in increments of up to 300,000 Square Feet, warehouse space to satisfy new requirements and compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.   OCCUPANCY: Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations in the fall of 2007.   DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-029 must be located in the National Capital Region, as clarified further in the SFO.  LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.   POINT OF CONTACT:  Matt Lynch; Phone: (202) 708-6066; E-Mail: matt.lynch@gsa.gov

DS has selected Dell servers as the standard server platform for the entire Bureau of Diplomatic Security IT enterprise. Please note that these are NOT personal computers, these are major infrastructure appliances used throughout the Bureau’s enterprise and located at different buildings across the United States.  The use of name brand is essential to the Government’s requirements for Department of State DS server consolidation and standardization.    This selection was approved by the DS ITCCB as required by 5 FAM 862.1(b).  By standardizing on Dell servers, DS has realized approximately a 20% savings in the form of Dell Systems Management (central management of enterprise Dell servers and storage devices), component commonality (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), maintenance and warranty costs, support personnel skill sets requirements and investment protection.  NOTE:  Any hardware vendor chosen other than Dell would require additional server monitoring software and hardware as DS currently only has the means to monitor and administer (from a lights out perspective) is the Dell DRAC enabled hardware; additional maintenance agreements; additional skill sets (personnel) and additional spare parts.   The Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the Department of State has a requirement for additional Dell 2950 and 1950 servers to further consolidate and standardize the enterprise.  The Dell servers are all being purchased with the same baseline configuration.  This configuration will support all known and foreseen needs in the enterprise, including web, Oracle, Exchange, Terminal, Print, and Blackberry servers.  These additional servers will be in addition to the servers that have already been purchased for the existing enterprise.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.DS identified multiple vendors for the Dell 2950 and 1950 Servers to seek best value pricing. Dell manufacturing provides compatibility and availability of the units, essential to meet the Agency’s requirements.  It is important to note that any vendor who sells Dell servers can provide these products.<BR><BR>

The United States Special Operations Command overall objective is to procure a highly reliable, effective, and lightwieght binocular helmet mounted fusion gogle, system that shall successfully operate in a variety of environments and weather conditions.  The contractor shall assume System Engineering Performance Responsibility (SEPR) and will produce and sustain Lightweight Improved Fusion-Helmet Mounted Goggle (LWF-HMG). The LWF-HMG shall be developed utilizing spiral development and produced in two (2) phases, Systems Integration, and System Demonstration.  The resultant product at each stage shall be capable of successfully operating and providing the operator with a reliable helmet mounted fusion goggle enabling him to detect and engage targets in both the Visible/Near Infrared (VIS/NIR) (Image Intensification (I2) channels) and the Long Wave Infrared (IR) channel wavelengths.  The System Integration LWF-HMG shall be a fully functional non-ruggedized version meeting form, fit and function as described in Section C.  The System Demonstration LWF-HMG shall be the ruggedized militarized version of the System Integration version meeting the Form, Fit and Function described in Section C and meeting environmental and MIL-STD requirements as indicated. 

2.0  PURPOSE:  This Statement of Objectives (SOO) expresses the top-level objectives of this acquisition and is provided in lieu of a Government-written Statement of Work.  This approach gives offerors the flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions with the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives that meet the objectives.  The offeror is also required to provide a detailed Statement of Work that is tied into the cost associated with how they will meet the government's objectives.

3.0  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:  A spiral acquisition strategy shall be utilized to design, develop, fabricate, construct, test, integrate, and field the LWF-HMG system meeting the requirements of this SOO and the LWF-HMG Requirements stated in Section C.  

4.0  CONTRACT OBJECTIVES:  A three phased contract to design, develop, fabricate, construct, test, integrate, and field the LWF-HMG.

5.0. TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES.

a.  The LWF-HMG systems must meet the threshold system performance characteristics and threshold other required system characteristics defined In Part I - The Schedule Section C ? Description/Specs./Work Statement.  In addition to the threshold characteristics defined in Section C, the LWF-HMG must be designed to meet the following overarching requirements; a system whose image intensification (I2) performance must meet or exceed the performance capabilities of the current PVS-23 night vision goggles, provide the operator with a rugged, reliable, and operational effective helmet mounted fusion goggle system which can be used during the conduct of the operator?s duties.  These duties may include target detection, recognition, and identification; nighttime ground mobility, and target engagement.   

b.  The LWF-HMG systems shall be designed to provide the operator the capability to see in low and no light conditions through the use of direct view image intensification tubes and uncooled Long Wave Infrared (IR) imagers.  These systems shall be designed with particular attention paid to lightweight system design to minimize the soldier's head borne weight.  In addition, the LWF-HMG shall be designed such that the functional controls of the system operate in an uncomplicated and intuitive manner so as to maximize the operational effectiveness of the systems.  All functional controls shall also be capable of one handed operation.  When worn by the operator, the LWF-HMG systems should be approximately the form and fit of the PVS-15A and PVS-23 or smaller.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Coast Guard will be issuing a solicitation to perform the open, inspection, report and overhaul of Philadelphia Gear Pumps, model numbers 46123R253, 46123R251RH and 46123R252LC.  This will be a requirements type contract with one (01) base year and four (04) option years.  The Philadelphia Gear Pumps are utilized on the 378? WHEC Cutters.  This requirement will also include:  (1) the overhaul/repair of model numbers 46123R253,46123R251RH and 46123R252LC.  This will be other than full and open competition using the Philadelphia Gear Company only.  The work shall be performed in accordance with Philadelphia Gear Company specifications, standards and recommended procedures for overhaul of the listed pumps.  All parts and facilities used during the overhaul shall be Philadelphia Gear Company facilities and parts.  Technical Data and/or drawings pertaining to Philadelphia Gear Company parts/services are proprietary to the OEM.  Accordingly it is believed that this non-availability of technical date precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center from obtaining competition as they are  available from this source.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

<DESC>30 August 2007 - This is an Amendment to combined synopsis/solicitation number N68335-07-T-0089.  The purpose of this Amendment is to:

1.	Extend the proposal due date to 2:00 PM EST, Wednesday 12 September 2007.
2.	Revise the description from "Powder Coating Spray Booth" to "Paint Spray Booth."  
3.	Provide the revised Specification to reflect the description change.  
4.	Provide the revised  Statement of Work to reflect the description change.  The SOW can be found on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select "Business", then "Doing Business With Us" and "Open Solicitations".  
5.	Include the following Questions and Answers regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation: 

The following questions are based on the following excerpt from the specifications.

Specification:  Filtration:     Filters shall have minimum 99.84% filtration efficiency; filters shall be cleanable via automatic pulsing using compressed air; filters shall contain no outer liner.  


1.  Please indicate the particle size the efficiency is based upon.  

 2.5 to 10 micron.

2.	Pulse cleaning of filters is utilized in cartridge type filtration which is conflicting with the filtration specified.  Please clarify or correct.  

Disregard pulse cleaning.  The Specification has been revised to reflect this.


The following questions are based on the following excerpt from the specifications.

Specification:  Minimum eighty (80) lineal feet of safety railing on booth ceiling.  Railing shall be OSHA approved.  Three (3) catwalks of 3' w x 15' long installed on booth ceiling in order to assist with operator servicing of light fixtures and exhaust fan system.  OSHA-approved ladder for ceiling access, to be mounted to the booth.


1.	If code approved inside access lights are used and extended lube lines for the fan is it still required to provide costly ladder, catwalks and handrails?  
 
Yes, that is a requirement.


Additional Question

1.	If the booth is returning the air back to the building after the 3 stage and HEPA filter, will you need Carbon Filtration for VOC's or will you exhaust to atmosphere?  If it is to atmosphere you could eliminate the HEPA and Carbon.  Is this your desire?

We have obtained permit approval to exhaust from the building.  The coatings utilized will not contain significant VOCs to require carbon filtration.  HEPA filtration is a requirement that we expect to see in the design.

If a proposal is considered complete, it will be considered for evaluation under Phase 2.   The government will then evaluate Best Value based upon the following factors; Technical, Past Performance, Past Experience, Price.

PROPOSAL COMPLETENESS (Phase 1)

The government will determine whether each Offeror's proposal is complete or incomplete. 

The government may consider the offer to be incomplete, and the Offeror will not be further evaluated or selected for contract award if:

	(a) The Offeror omits significant information required by Section L of this RFQ that is considered by the government to be necessary in order to understand the basic aspects of the item(s) proposed. Minor omissions and clarifications may be required of the offeror to still be considered to have submitted a complete proposal.

BEST VALUE EVALUATION FACTORS (Phase 2)

The following requirements/information will be requested from all firms submitting proposals and offers will be evaluated under FAR 13.106-2 

1. Technical description, including overall dimensions, power requirements, major component identification, performance qualities, terms and conditions of warranty, features of the equipment and logistics requirements.

2. Past Performance

3. Experience

4. Price 

The above factors are equal in weight. 

The following criteria will be used to identify the response providing the best value to Government: 


TECHNICAL:

Under the factor (1), "Technical Description", the following enhancing characteristics will be considered: a) Simplicity of Operation, b) Safety to Operating Personnel, c) Durability, d) Low Energy Usage, and e) Low Maintenance.

PAST PERFORMANCE:

The government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements. Offerors with no past performance will be rated neutrally (offeror receives no merit or demerit for the past performance factor). Past performance of limited relevance will be given less weight during evaluation.

The following guidelines apply, and are equal in importance: 
     
ELEMENT	RATING CONSIDERATION
Quality	Non-conforming supplies.  Contract terminated for default.  Warranty work had to be done. Quality awards won.

<SUBJECT>C--Modification of Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action for Facility Repair and Renewal Program Architect Engineer Acquisition - Unrestricted Competition
<SOLNBR>W912DY-07-R-0048
<RESPDATE>090607
<ARCHDATE>11052007
<CONTACT>sarah.annerton, 256-895-1167
<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:     This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program, A-E requirements.     The purpose of the FRR program is to support its vari ous customers throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, a nd maintenance requirements.     In order to accomplish this objective, the FRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders may be issued for the provision of stand-alone Architect-Engineer (A-E) services.     The contracts will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.     See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.       The North Ameri can Industrial Classification System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00.     The proposed contract ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.     The total requirements expected to be awarded under the  FRR A-E contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $15,000,000.     The Government will conduct two separate competitions for award of ID/IQ A-E contracts to support the FRR A-E requirements (one unrestricted and one restricted for competition among st 8(a) small businesses). This public announcement is for the unrestricted competition and is intended to result in multiple awards (approximately 2).     Of the total $15,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $10,000,000 is estimated for t he unrestricted MATOC pool which will be shared amongst the awardees in the MATOC pool.     The A-E Contractors and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an FRR construction (with design-build  capabilities) contract (see W912 DY-06-R-0029, W912DY-07-R-0032, and W912DY-07-R-0033).     The A-E Contractors and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an FRR construction (with design-buil d capabilities) award (see W912DY-06- R-0029, W912DY-07-R-0032, and W912DY-07-R-0033).     Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.     The highest ranked firm selected for negotiatio ns will be provided a Request for Price Proposal (RFPP).     If a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, a RFPP package will be provided to the firm ranked next on the approved selection report.     This procedure would continue until all mut ually satisfactory contract(s) have been negotiate d and awarded.     Placement of task orders will be consistent with FAR subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services and subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts.     The Government will provide each award ee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts.     The Government will consider award of the A-E task order to the 8(a) awardee prior to consideration of the unrestricted awardees.      If it is determined inappropriate to award the task order to the 8(a) awardee, the Government will then consider the unrestricted awardees for the task order award.     If the Government has information available to ensure that each awardee is provide d a fair opportunity to be considered for each order, the Government may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee.     When selecting an order awardee the Government will consider:     a.       Capabili ty to perform the level of complexity required for successful execution of t he task;     b.       Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, includ ing quality, timeliness and cost control; c.       Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor; and d.       Minimum order requirements.     Cost will not be an evaluation factor to be considered in selecting an order awardee.     Formal ev aluation plans and scoring of quotes or offers will not be required.     The Government will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,000 unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies . PROJECT INFORMATION:     The Facility Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required t o prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporting documents necessary for execution of the FRR projects issued by task order.     As par t of the design effort the contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate, and recommend solutions.     The level of detail and format of the design packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the FRR project.     A complete design , including a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and cost estimated, MCACES construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report , an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and maintenance manual shall be developed for each project.     In addition to project designs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, value engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of  parametric estimates, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services.     In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the A-E Contractor to perform any part or all  of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.     SELECTION CRITERIA:     The selection criteria for the basic ID/IQ contracts are listed below and are equal in importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterio n).     Criteria a-e are primary.     Criteria f-g are secondary and will only be used as  tie-breakers  among firms that are essentially technically equal.     a.     Specialized experience and technical competence in:     (1)     Design of new facilities  and design of renovations of facilities including but not limited to Barracks, Office/Administration facilities, Laboratories, Command Operations facilities, Warehouses, Morale Welfare Recreation/Non-Appropriated Funds facilities, and support functions of  facilities (generators, power, water, steam); (2)     Experience of the prime firm and significant subcontractors (i.e. any subcontract which equals 10% or more of the prime contract) in working together; (3) Experience in adapting standard design package s.     The adaptations should demonstrate space conversions (warehouses to offices for example), working with existing systems in renovating portions of facilities; (4) Rehabilitation of existing facilities of various types, sizes, and complexities;     (5 ) Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria;     (6) Design of projects on Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veteran Affairs, State Department, Department of Interior, Department of Energy, Department of Tr ansportation, and state and local government facilities; (7) Specific technical capabilities, such as construction cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering and materials testing.     The technical capabilities should demonstrate the type of equipment  or software used and the need for subcontractors to perform these tasks; (8) Knowledge of specific laws, regulations, building codes and criteria that are enco untered in the design of government and private facilities; (9)     Bentley Microstation CAD software, necessary equipment to run software, USACE A/E/C CADD standards, production of PDF files for advertisement and the ability to convert CAD production sour ce files into fully functional, error free files of AutoCAD and other required CAD products; (10) Design quality management approach.     Specifically, how will the contractor maintain the quality of the design and cost control. What system is in place to assure the design quality is maintained?     b.     Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services.     The Government will consider the qualifications, experience, and training of licensed, registered, and/or c ertified key personnel.     Resumes shall be provided in Section E for the following key personnel:     architect, structural engineer, civil engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, communications engineer, fire protection engineer, geotechnica l engineer, land surveyor, safety engineer, interior designer, cost engineer, project manager, and landscape architect.     Also provide the resume for a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Accredited Professional (LEED-AP), which can be one of t he personnel listed above.     c.  Past performance on recent (i.e. performed within the past three (3) years from the release of this announcement) DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance sche dules, as determined from Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and other sources.     PPIRS will be queried for all prime firms.   Performance evaluations for any key subcontractors will also be considered.   Any credible, information on p ast performance can be considered, but a board is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from PPIRS.   d.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.   The Government will consider the firms  ability to make available an adequate number of interdisciplinary teams to accomplish at least five (5) task orders simultaneously.     e.     Capability to perform work throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U .S. Territories and possessions.     Firms should demonstrate their capability to perform work in multiple geographic locations.     Greater consideration will be given to the A-E firms with the capability to perform work in diverse locations rather than o nly having experience in one geographic area.     f.     Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) in the proposed contract team , measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.   The greater the participation the greater the consideration. g.

<SUBJECT>C--Modification of Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action for Facility Repair and Renewal Program Architect Engineer Acquisition - 8(a) Restricted Competition
<SOLNBR>W912DY-07-R-0049
<RESPDATE>090607
<ARCHDATE>11052007
<CONTACT>sarah.annerton, 256-895-1167
<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:     This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program, A-E requirements.     The purpose of the FRR program is to support its vari ous customers throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, a nd maintenance requirements.     In order to accomplish this objective, the FRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders may be issued for the provision of stand-alone Architect-Engineer (A-E) services.     The contracts will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.     See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.       The North Ameri can Industrial Classification System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00.     The proposed contract ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.     The total requirements expected to be awarded under the  FRR A-E contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $15,000,000.     The Government will conduct two separate competitions for award of ID/IQ A-E contracts to support the FRR A-E requirements (one unrestricted and one restricted for competition among st 8(a) small businesses). This public announcement is for the 8(a) restricted competition which is intended to result in a single award.     Of the total $15,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $5,000,000 is estimated for the 8(a) award.     The A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an FRR construction (with design-build capabilities) award (see W912DY-06-R-0029, W912DY-07-R-0032, and W912DY-07-R-0033). Placement of task orders will be consistent with FAR subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services and subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts.     The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order exceeding $ 3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A -E contracts.     The Government will consider award of the A-E task order to the 8(a) awardee prior to consideration of the unrestricted awardees.     If it is determined inappropriate to award the task order to the  8(a) awardee, the Government will then consider the unrestricted awardees for the task order award.     If the Government has information available to ensure that each awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order, the Government may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee.     When selecting an order awardee the Government will consider:     a.       Capability to perform the level of complexity required for successful executi on of the task;     b.       Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control; c.       Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor; and d.       Minimum order requirements.     Cost will  not be an evaluation factor to be considered in selecting an order awardee.     Formal evaluation plans and scoring of quotes or offers will not be required.     The Government will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-ord er or task-order exceeding $3,000 unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. PROJECT INFORMATION:     The Facility Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required to prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporti ng documents necessary for execution of the FRR projects issued by task order.     As par t of the design effort the contractor may be required to survey the pr oblem areas, evaluate, and recommend solutions.     The level of detail and format of the design packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the FRR project.     A complete design, including a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction co ntractor submittal register, quantity and cost estimated, MCACES construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft o perations and maintenance manual shall be developed for each project.     In addition to project de signs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, p rogram management, conceptual designs, value engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of parametric estimates, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services.     In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the A-E Contractor to perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction cont ract.       SELECTION CRITERIA:     The selection criteria for the basic ID/IQ contracts are listed below and are equal in importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion).     Criteria a-e are primary.     Criteria f is secondary and w ill only be used as a      tie-breaker  among firms that are essentially technically equal.     a.     Specialized experience and technical competence in:     (1)     Design of new facilities and design of renovations of facilities including but not limite d to Barracks, Office/Administration facilities, Laboratories, Command Operations facilities, Warehouses, Morale Welfare Recreation/Non-Appropriated Funds facilities, and support functions of facilities (generators, power, water, steam); (2)     Experience  of the prime firm and significant subcontractors (i.e. any subcontract which equals 10% or more of the prime contract) in working together; (3) Experience in adapting standard design packages.     The adaptations should demonstrate space conversions (ware houses to offices for example), working wit h existing systems in renovating portions of facilities; (4) Rehabilitation of existing facilities of various types, sizes, and complexities;     (5) Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria;     ( 6) Design of projects on Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veteran Affairs, State Department, Department of Interior, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and state and local government facilities; (7) Spe cific technical capabilities, such as construction     cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering and materials testing.     The technical capabilities should demonstrate the type of equipment or software used and the need for subcontractors to perform  these tasks; (8) Knowledge of specific laws, regulations , building codes and criteria that are encountered in the design of government and private facilities; (9)     Bentley Microstation CAD software, necessary equipment to run software, USACE A/E/C CAD D standards, production of PDF files for advertisement and the ability to convert CAD production source files into fully functional, error free files of AutoCAD and other required CAD products; (10) Design quality management approach.     Specifically, how  will the contractor maintain the quality of the design and cost     control. What system is in place to assure the design quality is maintained?     b.     Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services.     Th e Government will consider the qualifications, experience, and training of li censed, registered, and/or certified key personnel.     Resumes shall be provided in Section E for the following key personnel:     architect, structural engineer, civil engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, communications engineer, fire protection engineer, geotechnical engineer, land surveyor, safety engineer, interior d esigner, cost engineer, project manager, and landscape architect.

PPIRS will be queried for all prime firms.     Performance evaluations for any key subcontractors will also be considered.     Any credible,     information on past performance can be considered, but  a board is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from PPIRS.     d.     Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.     The Government will consider the firm s ability to make available an adequate number of interdisciplinary teams to accomplish at least five (5) task orders simultaneously.     e.     Capability to perform work throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Haw aii, and U.S. Territories and possessio ns.     Firms should demonstrate their capability to perform work in multiple geographic locations.

<DESC>RFI Title: Tracking and Managing Extracts from Secure Systems. Sensitive Agency Information. Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
	
Action: It is requested that information relating to current solutions and future implementations of applications, tools, appliances, and associated procedures to address managing tracking, reporting, and erasure of Sensitive Agency Information, extracted from databases and other controlled systems and environments as directed by OMB M-06-16 be provided to GSA as result of issuance of this RFI. 

Disclaimer: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must comply with the SEC confidential treatment regulations at 17 C.F.R. 200.83.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.

GSA is providing this RFI on behalf of another Federal Agency.

Summary:
The tracking, managing, protecting, and erasure of Sensitive Agency Information, particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII), extracted from a controlled IT environment such as data stores and databases are of significant interest to the Federal Government.  Security breaches from several Federal Agencies over the past two years resulting in unauthorized release of PII have heightened the need for a focused solution.

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-06-16, Protection of Sensitive Agency Information (SAI), identifies four Action Items addressing defensive IT controls to assist in maintaining elevated security environments for Sensitive Agency Information.  Action Item #4 recommends all Federal Agencies Log all computer-readable data extracts from databases holding sensitive information and verify each extract including sensitive data has been erased within 90 days or its use is still required.  Addressing this Action Item within the variety of Federal Agency IT environments and unique organizational needs will require an integrated and intelligent solution from industry.  An effective, cost efficient, operational solution is the goal of this RFI.

Federal Agency data stores and information repositories include legacy and new technologies span the enterprise, and include mainframes, Storage Area Networks/Network Attached Storage (SAN /NAS), databases, file servers, email servers, etc. and potentially, web and application servers.  As technology evolves, so Federal IT diversity expands.  With government growth, so grows the need to share data in a controlled, secure manner.  Thus, authorized systems, applications, and scripts extract and share information from a multitude of Agency repositories with a plethora of stakeholders.  Agencies and their organizations must manage these information transfers, and endow both parties with the confidence that information is safe and maintained within understood bounds and paradigms.

However, problems arise as information moves farther from an Agency core and beyond its central control. Once out of managed, secure data repositories and traversing beyond the reach of established alerting and access controls, disparate protection methods no longer provide adequate insight or management.  How secure is Personally Identifiable Information once it has entered this unstructured environment? Where it moves, who accesses it, or what manipulations are done to it can no longer be established nor controlled. New tools are needed that extend Enterprise information oversight and protection into less structured environments. Technology is needed that can determine how this information is stored and dispersed, to manage data deletion compliance after it is no longer required; and thus secure information to the degree within, or on-par with, the original repository.

Further Contact Information:
Attn: Jon D. Faye
Contracting Officer

Based on OMB June 23, 2006 release of memorandum M-06-16, the GSA is requesting responses from industry corporations, scientists, researchers, and organizations that represent the Information Technology (IT) industry data leakage, tracking and management community, on how best to implement a solution to identify, track, manage, log, report, and erase Sensitive Agency Information (SAI), particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII), extracted from databases and other controlled environments, within Agency, and its sub-organization, IT architectures, as it traverses and settles across the Enterprise. 

The GSA requests descriptions of industry approaches, practices, and capabilities to provide the services requested in this RFI.  Responses shall address listed objectives, and not be used to provide marketing material. Vendors shall explain how their solution and/or products will meet the goal of achieving OMB M-06-16, Action Item #4. Vendors shall explain if their products meet this requirement out-of-the-box, if customization and integration is required, as well as in-whole or in-part. Vendors are also encouraged to propose alternative approaches that may be different than the generic solution outlined in this RFI. However, the various solution components and/or target points of data extraction and subsequent storage must be addressed.  

For purposes of this RFI, the term Personally Identifiable Information (PII), defined by OMB M-06-19, means any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual identity, such as their name, social security number, date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any other personal information which is linked or linkable to an individual.  

Based on the various IT environments implemented across Federal Agencies, and in coordination with Federal Enterprise Architecture requirements and recommendations, a solution that can integrate with existing Agency architectures is envisioned. Thus, the solution must be versatile, allowing placement of components or software in conjunction with a variety of IT environments. These environments include, but are not limited to mainframes, SAN/NAS, databases; file, email, web and application servers; etc., and the tape archival systems that support them. Additionally, environments will include workstations, portable devices such as laptops, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices, and media such as DVDs and CDs. Functions within the vendor solution shall monitor PII extractions and archive tracking data (date and time SAI was removed, entities performing the extract, and extracted data or its representation).  Any SAI or PII stored within solution components or sent between components shall be protected, possibly through encryption or some other mechanism, according to federal security standards. There shall be proactive solution processes implementing compliance of Federal recommendations for erasure/removal of SAI within 90 days from the date the information is no longer needed. The solution shall have a central management component/console which tracks, records, consolidates and correlates, and may initiate pre-determined actions on SAI. The management component therefore, shall provide reporting of all solution functions. 

A.	PII Monitoring and Managing Solution Objectives
The high level objectives of this RFI are summarized as follows.
1.	Data security controls shall be an integral process/function to the proposed solution addressing Federal confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements. 
2.	Ability to identify or tag, and log SAI data removed/extracted from secure IT data repositories.
3.	Ability to manage (log, track, monitor, and report) PII as it traverses across, and outside of, the Enterprise Architecture in various electronic forms.

8.	Ability to track and manage PII database extracts over time in accordance with Federal and Agency retention policies (erasure within 90 days (or some configurable period), or designated as still being required). Solutions should address user nodes ??? e.g. workstation, laptop, PDA, and other secondary repositories. 
9.	Ability to automate alerting of PII existence after 90 days (or some configurable period) if PII is no longer needed.
10.	Ability to automate the proactive erasure/relocation of PII in accordance with retention requirements and policy.
11.	Ability to consolidate monitoring and tracking results at a management component/console that maintains an intelligent, on-going record of data extracts, their location, users/nodes having these extracts, and storage duration.
12.	Ability to scan in coordination with, and report to, a central management component. 
13.	Ability to perform proactive scanning of network segments or specific nodes for PII creation, storage, and compliance with time-based erasure/relocation/archival requirements and policy.
14.	Ability to perform reactive scanning of network segments or specific nodes for known data extractions, data replications, and compliance with time-based erasure/relocation/archival requirements and policy.
15.	Ability to control access to PII data stored or transmitted by solution components providing confidentiality, integrity and proper availability.
16.	Ability to protect, possibly through encryption, SAI stored on solution components.
17.	Ability to protect, possibly through encryption, communications between solution components. 
18.	Ability to integrate with existing Identity Management Access Control methodologies (PKI Certificates, Tokens, etc.).
19.	Ability to track and report PII when written to portable storage and media.


B.	Supplemental Objectives
1.	Ability, once data has been identified or tagged, to protect it from unauthorized release or distribution.
2.	Ability to report and provide metrics on occurrences and quantities of SAI or PII data elements (Social Security Number (SS#), address, DOB, financial data, etc.).
3.	Ability to report and provide metrics of the most significant user, program, or other criteria; e.g. creator of PII material, or program with most extracted material, etc. 
4.	Ability to encrypt data written to portable storage.
5.	Ability to accommodate disconnected end-user devices within the solution, e.g. either by reporting disconnected devices containing SAI at last connection, or once reconnected rescanning devices for previous or new SAI content.
6.	Ability to manage (log, track, monitor, report and erase) remote extractions of SAI and PII from the Enterprise, or the sharing of SAI and PII between Agencies.

In addition to the typical descriptive reply, vendors shall respond by listing the objective above with their response to immediately follow, thus assisting assessors who evaluate the degree of objective achievement.

Pricing: Vendors shall provide pricing information (GSA pricing, if available) to allow the government to understand and forecast costs involved in implementing the vendor solution by individual hardware and software components. Example of vendor pricing model may include: 1) license cost per server/node, 2) cost per number of server/nodes, or database monitored, 3) cost per appliance. 

Vendor shall also provide volume discounts presenting expected pricing and implementation costs for various sized organizations. Organizations for this effort, addressing a corresponding amount of infrastructure, shall be very small (~50 users), small (~500 users), medium (~ 5000 users), and large organizations (~50,000 users). Vendors shall provide all assumptions.

Supplemental Information:

PII Monitoring and Managing Solution Concept

Federal Agencies have an extremely wide variety of operational environments across their various enterprises, and therefore require flexible, versatile solutions. The description below and Diagram 1, PII Monitoring and Management Solution Concept, provides visual perspective and insight into a possible solution to the described scenario. 
 
Insert Diagram 1, PII Monitoring and Management Solution Concept here???

Example Scenario
Agency mission information is located in various enterprise repositories, the largest being their mainframe. Data maintained and protected within various logical partitions contains PII data collected while achieving the agency, and its sub-organization, missions. A nightly script accesses several databases and extracts data, containing PII, for consolidation and future application processing. Days later, analysts within the Agency access this consolidated information from an application server through a thick client, transferring data with PII to their workstations. As the agency has vague rules prohibiting PII removal, an analyst exports several data sets, and copies them to a CD for transport to another office. 

In this scenario PII exists in four locations (the mainframe database, application server, workstation, and CD); and on potentially three devices that do not control access in accordance with permissions established on the original databases (workstation, CD, and depending on the permissions assigned, application server). The distribution (writing PII to CD) accommodates PII removal from the Agency physical as well as logical protections without accommodating for its management.

In order to comply with M-06-16 in the above scenario, a solution would need to address the following:
1.	Identify PII upon extraction from the mainframe and application server databases;
2.	Track and manage PII located on the analysts workstations;
3.	Track, manage, and protect PII distributed to portable media (CD);
4.	Manage PII establishing the ninety-day erasure period, and on the ninetieth-day announcing the need to erase (or performing erasure/relocation);
5.	Monitor/scan the workstation to determine if identified PII remains, was distributed, reconfigured or deleted/relocated;
6.	Securely report changes in PII to the scanning application or management component;
7.	Scan workstations periodically to determine if new PII exists, or was distributed; and,
8.	Collect and intelligently present status of PII located throughout the enterprise.

PII Monitoring and Managing Solution Concept Components

Vendor responses need not be limited by the architecture described herein.  Solutions that involve some of the components described, or seek to address the above objectives in a totally different manner, are welcome. Partial solutions are acceptable. Solutions allowing for options addressing this situation, such as component/service cafeteria-style selection, to meet various objectives and needs is acceptable. Descriptions of how the complete implementation of policy, products and services will be deployed in an Enterprise environment are encouraged.

The following are functional descriptions of solution concept components.  

1.	The PII Monitoring Appliance.
A PII Monitoring Appliance shall have the ability to be placed in front of, or in conjunction with, various data repositories throughout the Enterprise (mainframes, SAN/NAS, databases; file, email, web and application servers). As PII data is extracted from a repository it shall be identified; along with a date/time stamp, the credentialed individual who or authorized process that performed the extraction; and reported to the management component/console for subsequent management (log, track, monitor, report, and erasure). This component would allow integration across significantly varied architectures. Communications between components shall be secure.

2.	The PII Monitoring Application.     
A PII Monitoring Application shall perform similar functions as the Monitoring Appliance but do so on an end-node (workstation, laptop, server, PDA, etc.). It shall also confirm the existence of previously identified PII, and scrutinize the system for any PII reconfiguration activities such as copy/paste to other data formats (database extracts into Word documents, spreadsheets; images files, etc.), as well as PII creation and generation.
The Monitoring Application shall detect data replication to any portable storage (CD/DVD, USB, etc.), or supplemental enterprise storage such as a network drive. Additionally, the Monitoring Application would monitor for any pending distributions such as email, instant messaging, web posting, etc. of PII, and potentially prevent this distribution. PII distributions and attempts shall be reported to a management component/console. Communications between components shall be secure. This Component should allow the end user to group related PII and manage collectively to reduce administrative efforts.

3.	The PII Management Component/Console.     
A PII Management Component/Console shall provide the ability to set criteria for identification of PII.  This component shall consolidate, store and present in an intelligent and efficient manner the location and status of PII identified or tagged from extraction points, to secondary storage, to end user nodes.  This component shall have the ability to consolidate tracking of PII movement throughout the Enterprise, log PII data manipulation; and provide consolidated management views/reports of PII status per node, per user, per project, etc.
The PII management component/console must also be able to direct the scanning appliance to perform scans, and maintain these results. Scan results shall be coordinated with previous scan results to provide further information and insights. Information shall have the ability to be sorted, filtered, and analyzed thus providing an Enterprise perspective. The PII Management Console shall provide reporting, trending, and graphing capabilities. 
Communications between components shall be secure.

4.	The PII Scanning Appliance.     
A PII Scanning Appliance shall perform scans on specific network segments, devices, and nodes, as directed by the management component/console. All results would be presented to the management component/console for long-term storage, management, analysis, and reporting. Communications between components shall be secure.

<DESC>This is for market research, not a request for quotations.  The purpose of this announcement is to determine the number of potential qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Businesses, or other Small Businesses who can furnish the services listed below.

We are looking for the above type of companies to evaluate and assess The Bureau of the Public Debt?s (BPD) executive resources through a 360 Leadership Assessment.  BPD is proactively addressing its critical human capital resources as the projection of separations and retirements over the next few years indicates that there may be an ever-increasing gap in critical leadership.  In order to address and close the gap, BPD must assess its talent and map its aggregate bench strength, then develop both a short and long term strategy for succession planning that will support BPD?s strategic plan and effectively leverage our executive leadership resources, while continuing to maintain and strengthen our values-based culture.  These assessments will enable BPD to fill executive positions quickly, and with the best-qualified candidates, while ensuring stability in the executive levels of the organization.  It will also provide an opportunity for employees to not only indicate positions to which they aspire but also a means to identify the additional competencies required to succeed in those positions and an action plan for obtaining them.

Please provide a capability statement regarding this type of work, in addition to company names and contract number for whom you have performed in the past, your business size and type, and DUNS number.

As an initial task to accomplish evaluating and assessing Public Debt?s executive resources, the Contractor shall conduct a comprehensive assessment of senior executive?s potential strengths and developmental needs in order to determine baseline bench strength and existing competency gaps within the leadership cadre.  The comprehensive individual assessment of executives must be based on objective criteria and include person face-to-face behavior interviews with each executive.  Referencing interviews shall be conducted with their superiors, peers, subordinates, and where appropriate with external customers.  The assessment will be documented in a written competency profile report of the individual?s current strengths, future potential and developmental needs, and will include external benchmarking.  An oral briefing may also be requested.  Based on the overall comprehensive analysis, the Contractor shall provide recommendations for short- and lone-term strategies, and shall include corresponding action plans for implementation of the strategies that should include industry best practices and/or activities.

Based on the initial assessment and in consultation with Public Debt, the Contractor shall develop a unified cross-divisional strategy and supporting action plans for Succession Planning for key leadership positions.

<SUBJECT>A--Systems Test and Integration Laboratory (STIL)
<SOLNBR>STIL
<RESPDATE>091307
<ARCHDATE>11122007
<CONTACT>Sherry Alexander, 407-384-3586
<DESC>The US Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is seeking information on sources for a Systems Test and Integration Laboratory (STIL) planned as a set of capabilities for the test of Aviation platforms in  a Virtual Flight Environment.   The STIL is intended to allow the testing of integrated systems, to fully immerse and exercise the integrated systems (aircraft) in a safe and affordable manner.  By employing stimulation, emulation and simulation the STI L will accomplish repeatable and reusable ground tests prior to flight testing/certification flights.  The system integrator would deliver equipment and software, to be housed in a government facility and interact with existing Government Furnished Equipme nt (GFE) and information networks, enabling System-of-Systems (SoS) testing in a distributed, synergistic form.  Background.   Modern helicopter designs most often include interdependent systems and subsystems, connected by a central data bus, which rely on each other for information to function properly.  The interrelations of these systems can pose significant challenges when co nducting developmental systems integration testing.  Because of the complexity of the interacting systems, open-air flight has become the default test method; however the cost and potential safety hazards increase while repeatability and accuracy often dec rease.  STIL implementation is planned as an evolution from a threshold of stand-alone equipment with connectivity to an integrated objective with much of the functionality networked and under central control by FY11.  Maximum integration of COTS test equipment, a utomation, stimulators, models and simulations is anticipated to provide for modernization and technology insertion.  The current Army funding for this effort is between $12 Million and $15 Million.  STIL Design and Integration. Design and function commonality will be maintained as much as possible while developing capabilities across the various test categories; this is to enhance vertical and horizontal integration of test components and capabilities, and further provide the gre atest testing requirements flexibility. Unique testing procedures and equipment will be introduced only as test specificity demands.  To allow for test requirements flexibility, the STIL must have an open architecture so it can be integrated into existing government facilities and will utilize existing GFE at those facilities. The STIL architecture should be based on defined standards, interfaces, and protocols to meet the test and integration needs for Army aircraft including CH-47, OH-58, UH-60, AH-64, AR H, and their variants, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and other aircraft.	 The STIL will augment and enhance normal open-air flight and ground testing through predictive testing using validated models and simulations to identify critical data points to focus open-air flight testing on the most important areas of the test profile.   In addition, simulated and/or recorded test data evaluation in the virtual environment allows supplemental testing, and repetitive testing of failed tests or anomalies enhancing cause-and-effect investigation utilizing the test-fix-test methodology. STIL Capabilities Needed. The STIL should provide stimulation and power to aircraft systems for ground test under controllable and repeatable conditions.  The STIL should have a transportable, modular design with surplus capacity to support growth.  It should have built-in self-tes t capability, and should not require periodic maintenance or specialized tools. The STIL should include a Test Control Center (TCC) that can configure, execute, monitor, and troubleshoot test scenarios and provide overall central control for various tests.  The TCC can control aircraft stimulation in a precise, synchronous, and repeat able manner.  It provides centralized observation and coordination of a test event and displays test data in near- real time.  It should provide visualization and analysis tools, archive test data, and should support remote access by test engineers.  The TCC should interface with the Defense Research and Experimentation Network to participate in distributed activities.   Certain aircraft and/or tests may require the operation of STIL in a classified mode. The STIL should perform time-tagged collection and recording of data and audio-video information.  It should playback data at synchronous and higher speeds to reproduce aircraft stimuli created by human-in-the-loop testing.  It should support test rehearsa l, and checkout of aircraft telemetry prior to flight. STIL components could be used independently as aircraft subsystem test benches, or together to provide synchronized input to multiple aircraft systems to simulate flight.  STIL components should be capable of being controlled remotely.  They should store t est data locally and be capable of uploading it for analysis, reporting, and archiving.  STIL components should be capable of simulating faults of aircraft systems.  They should support both bused and non-bused aircraft.  STIL components should be upgradea ble through software.   The STIL should have a navigation system test capability.  The STIL navigation test equipment should stimulate and monitor aircraft navigation systems singly or together, including:   * Inertial Navigation System (INS)  EGI to be provided.   * Global Positioning System (GPS)  satellite signal jamming, spoofing, & multi-path effects   * Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range (VOR)   * Instrument Landing System (ILS)    * Automatic Direction Finder (ADF)   * Air Data Computer (ADC)   * Radar altimeter   * Doppler Velocity sensor   * Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN)  up to 4 TACAN ground stations   * Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)  Modes 1, 2, 3/A, 3/C, 4, 5, S level 3, and MCAS. The STIL test equipment for aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) should stimulate and monitor:   * Simulated threat systems   * Aircraft countermeasure systems. The STIL aircraft sensor test equipment should stimulate and monitor:   * IR sensors  acuity, minimum resolvable temperature, minimum detectable temperature,   and target projection including IR scene simulation.   * Fire control radar including radio frequency interferometers (RFI)   * Laser rangefinder and designator  variable range, characteristics, and codes. The STIL should test aircraft systems including:   * Pitot-static  Altitude, air speed, and rate of climb   * Outside air temperature   * Electrical systems including power fluctuations. The STIL should test aircraft digital communications including SATCOM.  It should also test voice communications for intelligibility, recording and playback, output power, antennas, and calibration.  It should provide an RF bridge to simulate a communicati ons environment. The STIL should test aircraft weapons and armament systems including:   * Simulating weapons  vehicle/weapon specific break-out panels, simulation plugs   * All stages of weapons operations including pre-launch, launch, and post-launch   * Correct signal detection report ratio (CSDRR)   * Threat prioritization   * Time to display threat type, change, and countermeasures   * Jamming identification and response   * Data link and target handover. The STIL should include a Human Factors Engineering environment with models of aircraft interiors and exteriors and a light controlled area to assess:   * Anthropomorphic data   * Field of view   * Workload analysis   * Instrumentation illumination. The STIL should include a Crew Station Interface (CSI) that is reconfigurable to provide tactical controls for the AH-64, CH-47, UH-60, and other aircraft.  Out-of-cockpit displays and cockpit instrumentation displays are coordinated with a high fidelity 6  DOF flight dynamics model to provide a virtual environment for human-in-the-loop testing.  It is sufficie ntly accurate to rehearse test missions prior to actual flight tests.  The CSI includes two (2) aircrew stations, which may be operated independently or integrated together for crew mission rehearsal.  The CSI should include an operator/engineering worksta tion and tools for development and testing of flight models. The STIL should include an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) workstation to assess UAS performance, which can be used to pilot the UAS in a virtual environment.  The CSI can also be used to control a UAS. The integrator will have both deep and broad experience in the design and support of Flight Test of aircraft on the ground, as well as an intimate knowledge of all Army Aircraft (rotorcraft, fixed wing and unmanned aircraft systems).

<SUBJECT>70 -- Nortel Network Products
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure the ?brand name? Nortel network hardware products to support the Patent File Wrapper System (PFW) project on the PTONet. 

USPTO has installed 220 Nortel Passport switches to support the PTONet infrastructure.  It allows us to connect servers and other switches to two different switches for high availability and load balancing.  The feature is proprietary to Nortel. The new server switches parts will be integrated into an existing Nortel switch infrastructure that is installed and in the ETC lab. Proper integration and compatibility with existing core network infrastructure is vital to the successful operation and support of mission critical solutions, such as (PFW).  

While it is possible to use switches other than Nortel on PTONet, it is not cost effective, nor practical for this procurement.  We are currently using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Sparse Mode.  Other switch manufacturers may or may not support that feature as each switch manufacturer has a propriety operating system and software to run the switch.  Integrating another vendor's network switches would require a redesign and extensive lab testing, updating Life Cycle Management documentation, establish and manage new maintenance contracts and conduct training for Network Operations staff.  In addition, introducing other switch vendor would complicate network troubleshooting which could result in longer network outages.  

This announcement is considered a ?brand name? justification. This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) among the existing USPTO Information Technology ID/IQ contractors.  No written solicitation will be issued as a result.   The point of contact for information regarding this notice is Connie Lum at (571) 272-4167, or via E-Mail at connie.lum@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>59 -- SOF C-130 AVIONICS SUSTAINMENT CAPABILITY RFI
<DESC>1. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is conducting a comprehensive Special Operations Forces (SOF) C-130 avionics study to meet growing obsolescence challenges and capability shortfalls by assessing potential modifications and upgrades for the Air Force Special Operations Command?s (AFSOC) C-130 aircraft inventory to 2025.  Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft included in this study are the AC-130H, AC-130U, MC-130E, MC-130H, MC-130P, and MC-130W.  A range of alternatives is desired, from near-term (fielding prior to 2015) through long-term (2015 to 2025).  The MC-130E/P aircraft will primarily be considered for near-term upgrades only, as they are programmed for recapitalization.  To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2010 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), USSOCOM requires current industry sources and capabilities information.
2.  The objectives of this RFI are to identify Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or commercially available solutions to SOF C-130 avionics challenges, assess technology and manufacturing readiness, and prepare budgetary planning estimates for possible programming initiatives.
3.  USSOCOM seeks information from responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed:
	a. systems integration requirements
	b. evolving Communications, Navigation, Surveillance (CNS), Air Traffic Management (ATM) and navigation safety mandates
	c. modification upgrade requirements
	d. sustainment concerns
Note.  An Additional Information Package is available once an interested respondent registers through Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS).  As the FedTeDS attachment is Export controlled, it can only be accessed by JCP approved parties.  A company may have a cage code indicating their security level, but it does not necessarily mean that you have export control status.  Interested Parties need to register their cage code with the JCP (DLIS) in order to acquire the export controlled status. 
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/default.asp <-- JCP link.
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/faq.asp <-- JCP Faqs with helpful information.
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/cageserv.asp <-- link explains what a cage code is.
4.  For the purpose of this RFI, the term ?proven? means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) ?6? or higher, preferably TRL ?7? or higher.  Adaptation of NDI or commercial solutions is encouraged.  Recommended solutions must meet current SOF C-130 capability, comply with CNS/ATM and Navigation Safety mandates, and provide a basis for future growth in capability.
5.  Interested parties should provide capabilities, qualification statements, and examples that demonstrate their ability to satisfy the required avionics challenges with low integration risk across the SOF C-130 inventory.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information on all or any subset of the areas listed.  No adverse evaluation will result from responses, which address only those specific areas applicable to one?s core business expertise.
6.  Respondents are to use a minimum number of pages to describe in detail the information requested.  Limit responses to no more than 50 pages, including attachments.  Responses are due 28 September 2007.
7.  This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the ?art of the possible? from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for possible uses of platforms within the military.  Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.  Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.  
Note:  Respondent?s attention is directed to the fact that contractor consultant/advisors to the Government will review and provide support during evaluation of submittals. When appropriate, non-government advisors may be used to objectively review a particular functional area and provide comments and recommendations to the Government. All advisors shall comply with procurement Integrity Laws and shall sign Non-Disclosure and Rules of Conduct/Conflict of Interest statements. The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data. Submission in response to this Request For Information constitutes approval to release the submittal to Government Support Contractors.
8.  U.S. and non-U.S. firms with appropriate Export Controll status are permitted to respond to this RFI.  Responses to questions from authorized interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company?s response.  Currently, one-on-one information gathering sessions with respondents are not contemplated.  If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are conducted, they will be offered to those responders that meet the requirements listed in the corresponding document on FedTeDS.  The purpose would be to clarify understanding of the submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss the form of agreement to cover any flight demonstrations.  Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after all qualitative assessments are completed.
9.  Per FAR) 52.215-3  Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997):
a. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request For Information Notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
b. Although ?proposal? and ?respondent? are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.
c. Any proposed solution must meet all Operational, Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) requirements mandated by the Department of Defense.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Brand Name for Cisco San Products
<DESC>The purpose of this memorandum is to provide a brand name justification, in accordance with FAR Part 11, to purchase CISCO MDS9000 SAN switches.  The USPTO has a large investment in storage, SAN switches and software products, along with a wise knowledge base of integrated storage, SAN switches and software.  The CISCO MDS9000 San Switches has been determined to provide this management capability with the most efficient means for mission critical storage infrastructure to be replicated to the USPTO's Boyers data bunker facility.  No other vendors' SAN Switch software products can be used due to incompatability.  The specific native mode protocols only available by the use of a single vendor's hardware and software, is the key freature of the SAN efficiencies that are required for a successful infrastructure spanning multiple data centers.  This is not a solicitation nor will one be issued to other than the holders of USPTO's existing ID/IQ contracts for IT Products.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Brand Name Rittal
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure brand name Rittal server racks to support existing Rittal hardware infrastructure that is installed in its data center facilities.  This announcement is considered a brand name justification.  This is not a solicitation.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The acquisition will be conducted utilizing existing USPTO?s Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quanity (ID/IQ) contracts for Information Technology products, a small business set-aside. No Request for Quotes will be released to any other firms.  Rittal server rack hardware is the USPTO's established standard based commercial product in accordance with the USPTO's Technical Reference Model (TRM), which defines a comprehensive set of information technology standards, services, interfaces, supporting data formats, and protocols.  It is essential that the USPTO acquire Rittal server racks for consistency and flexibility.  Currently, the USPTO has 170 installed Rittal server racks.  The Rittal racks are much more versatile because they will handle all manufacturer servers, including Dell, IBM, HP and SUN (x386 (Intel) as well as HP UNIX).  By using the Rittal racks, we are able to support all manufacturers and move servers within the data center as necessary to support operations without having to purchase manufacturer specific racks.  Rittal is the manufacturer for Dell, HP and some of the IBM racks but because these racks are built for a specific manufacturer, they are a higher cost.  Since Rittal is the supplier for the other server manufacturers as well as those mentioned above, we are actually able to purchase a better rack at a lower cost then buying manufacturer specific racks.  Rittal was selected for the first phase of the Enterprise Remote Access (ERA) purchase, and we need to continue their use for continuity and for efficient use of replacement parts and spare parts.  These racks are for phase 2 of the ERA project.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed by email to Sylvia Van Dyke at Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- Air Defense Communications Service Extension
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) at Scott Air Force Base, IL is working with the 1st Air Force (Air Forces Northern), Tyndall AFB to issue a sole source modification to General Dynamics Information Technology, INC., 77 A Street Needham MA 02494-2806.  The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of the work performed by General Dynamics under contract DCA200-01-D-5006, Air Defense Communications Services (ADCS), which was competitively awarded on 6 July 2001.  The ADCS contract provides management, maintenance and repair as well as logistics support of the existing highly sophisticated and critical communications system and subsystems used in support of NORAD/NORTHCOM, including system improvements, upgrades and modifications that require engineering knowledge and experience.  The Air Force standard for system availability is 99.999%.  Due to the critical nature of the NORAD/NORTHCOM air defense mission, the Government cannot take the risk of loss of service.  General Dynamics is uniquely suited to provide the services due to their in-depth knowledge of the communications equipment and unique communications systems they developed to support the communication portion of the air defense mission.  They have already responded to the aftermath of 9/11 by engineering and integrating the interior CONUS and NORTHCOM command, control, and communications infrastructure into modernized Air Defense Operations Center's (AOC) command and control (C2) systems and subsystems for the CONUS regions and applied these standardized and operationally accepted systems into the PACAF region.  Additionally, General Dynamics also provides troubleshooting supported by the Captive Off-Line Facility (COLF), redesign of unique communication systems, and software support.  General Dynamics has in place Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) sources to support the existing system hardware and software.   General Dynamics provides system management, engineering and maintenance personnel who are uniquely qualified through years of air defense systems engineering, development, and maintenance experience to ensure the necessary continuity and availability of the ADCS system.  This modification will: 1) extend the period of performance of the contract for the period of 01 October 2007 to 30 September 2008, and 2) increase the ceiling dollar amount by $8,329,137.43, from $107,556,793.81 to $115,895,931.24.  The purpose of the proposed modification is to facilitate the simultaneous efforts to prepare an acquisition package, accommodate the current and anticipated efforts associated with processing routine requirements, and complete the current sector transformation effort.  The increased ceiling amount will be utilized to ensure continuity of operations and to maintain standardization and interoperability throughout all of the United States. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposal.  See Numbered Note 22. All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Joyce King, Contracting Officer, at Joyce.King@disa.mil, or Adam Q. Hemken, Contract Specialist, Adam.Hemken@disa.mil.

The rule is effective October 1, 2007, without further action, unless SBA receives a significant adverse comment by September 28, 2007.  If SBA receives any significant adverse comments, the Agency will publish a timely withdrawal of this rule in the <i>Federal Register</i>.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure a technical expert that would work with Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) to develop programs and initiatives involving the use of systems thinking and strategic Partnerships as approaches to address health problems where scientists, practitioners, and decision makers can work together to accelerate the translation, implementation, dissemination, adoption, and maintenance of behavioral and social sciences research.  

This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 with a small business standard of $6.5 million.  The period of performance shall be for a period of one year with one additional option year.  

Background

The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.  

Based on its Strategic Prospectus, OBSSR?s vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR?s plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary ?team science? that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis ? from cells to society ? required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.

Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop programs and initiatives involving the use of systems thinking and strategic Partnerships as approaches to address health problems where scientists, practitioners, and decision makers can work together to accelerate the translation, implementation, dissemination, adoption, and maintenance of behavioral and social sciences research.

Systems thinking approaches and strategic Partnerships show promise for unlocking the secrets of complex, multi-dimensional health issues, and for transforming this knowledge into effective interventions that can fundamentally change population health.  OBSSR intends to harness systems thinking approaches to support very clear and specific objectives: 1) to better understand the complex biobehavioral bases of current population health issues; 2) to create a research culture that works to find and implement solutions to these health problems by understanding how to organize networks of stakeholders at multiple levels; 3) to develop more efficient systems that maximize existing resources; and 4) to effectively disseminate emergent knowledge.  

Scope of Work

The contractor shall participate as an expert consultant and researcher in the application of systems thinking approaches to address public health problems.  The contractor shall plan and advise OBSSR?s senior staff in developing research projects to implement the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving systems thinking approaches and the development of Strategic Partnerships. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following ten key OBSSR goals:

1.	Facilitate the identification of and the development and application of conceptual frameworks and tools needed for implementation of Systems Thinking approaches and use of Strategic Partnerships in the systematic study of health and its determinants.

2.	Promote and support the development of biometrics, and the maintenance and widespread use of databases containing longitudinal genomic, biomarker, social, and behavioral data related to health. 

3.	Contribute to the development of analytical frameworks, methods, and algorithms capable of integrating, analyzing, and interpreting highly diverse data with varying metrics from research on genomic sequences, molecules, behavior, and social systems.

4.	Collaborate in the development of curricula, modules, and materials required to train health scientists in the application of systems thinking and tools.

5.	Develop programs to encourage the application of systems organizing principles among stakeholder organizations in BSSR, and promote the development of systems organizing expertise among leaders, policymakers, and researchers.

6.	Provide recommendations and priorities for ways in which systems thinking and strategic partnerships can best be implemented and harnessed to address policy resistant public health problems.

Further, strong collaborative relationships between OBSSR and its internal and external partners are crucial to realizing its vision of science and public health.  Hence, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following goals:

7.	Develop programs to improve collaboration with internal NIH partners and to improve the investment in basic and applied research in behavioral and social sciences at specific ICs and throughout NIH.

8.	Develop programs to improve collaboration with external partners to build support among key stakeholders, decision makers, gatekeepers, and the general public for a stronger science of behavior.

OBSSR is planning to convene two meetings in FY2008: (1) A workshop to identify ?policy resistant problems? relevant to the OBSSR mission and prioritize them; and, (2) a two day meeting of leaders in the field to formulate new research questions, directions, perhaps a new grid or paradigms for the next generation of health disparities research.
The outcome of these meetings will inform planned Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) to be released in FY 2009 or 2010.  

The Contractor shall:

9.	Participate as a member (i.e., to bring to bear his/her expertise in systems thinking approaches and methods as they relate to public health problems) of the Working Group to manage and coordinate OBSSR?s activities in developing two Concept Maps with Concept Systems, Inc (CSI).  The first priority is Policy Resistant Public Health Problems.   The second focus of this scope of work is the topic of Health Disparities, and identifying the priorities related to behavioral and social science.  These projects will be led by an OBSSR and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) program official, as well as other OBSSR senior staff assigned to these projects.  It will also include two CSI senior staff and one project manager.  

10.	Participate in a November 15-16, 2007 Expert Panel Meeting as an expert researcher in the behavioral and social sciences with strong academic credentials in employing systems thinking approaches and models to address public health problems. Participants (i.e., 15 to 30 policy experts, academic researchers, government representatives and other officials as identified by OBSSR) will attend the November 15-16, 2007 meeting and will be charged with consideration of the results of the conceptual framework developed in a concept mapping process.  

11.	Participate in a Spring 2008 two day meeting (i.e., to bring to bear his/her expertise in systems thinking approaches and methods as they relate to public health problems) of leaders in the field to formulate new research questions, directions, perhaps a new grid or paradigms for the next generation of health disparities research. (To be held at Stanford Center for Advanced Studies). This will be a convening of key scientists/stakeholders, the purpose being to formulate research strategies/initiatives built upon the provided background materials. Specified scientists and key other stakeholders (in large part identified through the concept mapping process) will be asked to explore integrated, cross-discipline, cross systems ways of answering pressing health disparities research problems/questions. The product of this meeting will serve to guide the development of a Funding Opportunity Announcement to support health disparities research.

For each of the specific objectives developed to address the goals listed above, the Contractor shall develop performance measures that may be utilized to assess OBSSR?s performance in achieving these goals and objectives.  

The expected tasks to be completed during the period of performance are as follows:

1)	Participate in a series of face-to-face meetings with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff members to consider the eight goals listed above
2)	Using the information gathered in task 1, develop an implementation plan for refining and prioritizing the above goals 
3)	Develop a draft strategic implementation plan for the refined goals listed above
4)	Circulate the draft plan to stakeholders and NIH Behavioral and Social Sciences Coordinating Committee for review and comments
5)	Revise the plan based on the comments received
6)	Finalize the plan for publication and implementation

The Contractor shall develop indicators of progress and success.  The contractor shall ensure that ongoing progress assessments will be easy to conduct and supportive of the Office?s efforts. The assessment approach will yield simple reports of progress over time, and indicate where success is indicated.  The progress assessment will serve not only to enable the internal OBSSR group to track progress, but also will point to communications opportunities with Institutes and Centers, external research and program partners, and other key supporters.

HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [Jun 2006]   
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional cost that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Requirement:  Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor (HPV) generator system that operates at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.  The HPV generator shall be portable, self contained and weigh less than 160 pounds.  The generator shall have a control touch panel and a 40 character, dot matrix, ink on paper, impact type printer.  The HPV generator system should utilize a closed-loop process using conditioned air as a carrier to deliver HPV to the exposed surfaces inside a seal enclosure.  The cycle progression must include the following, but not limited to:  After the H2O2 reservoir is filled, the decontamination cycle proceeds through four phases:  Dehumidification, Condition, Decontamination, and Aeration. a.       Reservoir fill- hydrogen peroxide is pumped from the cartridge to a reservoir. b.       Dehumidification phase- dry, HEPA filtered air is circulated to reduce humidity to a predetermined level in the 10-60% relative humidity range (room applications will use 40-60%). This phase permits necessary H2O2 vapor concentrations to be maintained below saturation levels during Condition and Decontamination phases.  The time to reach the targeted humidity increases with the volume of the enclosure. c.       Condition phase- flow of dry, HEPA-filtered air continues while the H2O2 vapor is injected into the air stream just before it leaves the generator.  The injection rate is controllable in the 1 to 12 grams per minute range.  The Condition phase can facilitate reaching the desired decontamination concentration more quickly in some larger enclosures.  Condition time is affected by the sterilant injection rate and enclosure volume.  Condition phase is optional and can be selected for the purpose of reducing total cycle time, especially for some larger applications. d.       Decontamination phase- constant flow of H2O2 vapor/ HEPA-filtered air mixture is maintained at the selected injection rate, within the controllable range. e.       Aeration phase- H2O2 vapor injection is stopped, and the recirculating flow of dry, HEPA-filtered air continues to reduce the vapor concentration within the enclosure for a programmed amount of time. f.        External exhaust through HVAC can be used for aeration and is recommended for room applications to reduce aeration time.  The HPV system should meet the following specifications:  EPA registration #58779-4 (surface sterilant for all exposed porous and non-porous surfaces within industrial, institutional, and commercial settings), Humidity controlled process that utilizes a desiccant technology to allow for consistent non-condensing, gaseous hydrogen peroxide concentrations that can penetrate HEPA filters, Utilize a PLC control that can operate wirelessly from a remote handheld device or laptop computer via public domain software, All data can be stored on a USB stick and transferred to a computer and external desiccant is regenerated off-line.  The system shall be provided with one on-site calibration.  The system shall be provided with one reusable desiccant cartridge, one high capacity dryer unit, one desiccant regenerator and one dryer blanket. This announcement will close on Sept 14, 2007 at 1600 CST.  Please email sarah.c.schauf@aphis@usda.gov

Aircraft maintenance operations which include sanding or grinding of primed and/or painted surfaces create a health and safety concern because of the proliferation of airborne hazardous dust. Chemicals and metals contained in the coatings pose a serious threat to workers who are exposed to the dust generated during the coating removal process. The most effective way to minimize the exposure levels is to capture dust at the source through vacuum collection. Specialized tools and vacuums are required to effectively capture and safely contain the dust.

Sanders and tools should incorporate dust collection shrouds which effectively capture the dust without obscuring the user?s line of sight to the working edge of the tool. For maximum efficiency, porous abrasives with a screen-like composition should be employed. Heavily preforated backup pads should be used in conjunction with these abrasives to maximize the available airflow through the abrasive. Compressed air hoses and vacuum hoses should be joined as a single unit to reduce the number of required parts and to eliminate trip hazards. Vacuums should be ULPA rated to a capture efficiency for 99.999% of particles 0.12u (micron) or larger. Vacuums should incorporate a Safe Filter Change method for changing filters without risking re-exposure of workers or the environment to the hazardous dust. To reduce overall air consumption, vacuums should incorporate automatic on/off features so that the vacuum only operates when a pneumatic tool is being used. Vacuum operating noise level should not exceed 79dB. Vacuums should also incorporate a manometer ( pressure differential guage) to alert users when filters need to be changed. Vacuums should include a cyclonic pre-seperator to reduce the number of filter changes required. Pneumatic vacuums should include a cyclonic a compressed air manifold to enable a single air supply to power the vacuum and up to three tools. This single air supply will limit the number of hoses on the shop or hangar floor, and will simplify setup and use for the maintainers. Vacuum systems should include a lockable hose reel component to allow vacuum hoses to be neatly organized and stored  with the system to the limit potential for hose damage or loss.

Sole Source Justification
For Invicta 210 Receiver and Mounting Kits

Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited.  As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information:

(1).  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a ?Justification for other than full and open competition.?

USCG Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN).

(2).  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

Purchase (one hundred -100) Invicta 210  MF Beacon Monitor station kits part number 1170171056.  The kits include MBA-2 Antenna near field, Power, Date Ethernet cable, and Antenna Cable, Reference and quick start manuals. 

(3).  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency?s needs
 (including the estimated value).

The Invicta 210 is a marine grade DGPS that has a 9-12 inch pass-to-pass accuracy that utilizes WAAS Differential and/or US Coast Guard signal.  This receiver includes a front panel display, a water proof enclosure, 10 Hz, 10 Channel GPS, WAAS, 9 inch pass to pass accuracy with WAAS, < 1 meter Accuracy, dual serial RS232 ports, front panel display and control, configurable via serial port from the ECPINS? software, and the added capability of providing the NMEA proprietary strings PMVXG 021 and PMVXG 830 messages in addition to all other standard NMEA sentences.  The RAVEN? Invicta 210 is the only DGPS that will allow the receiver to be configurable via the ECPINS software and also provide the additional proprietary NMEA strings.  The entire cost of the RAVEN? receivers are $204408.  
Use of a different DGPS receiver would cause added cost in ECPINS? software development and testing in addition to any research and development cost of to any DGPS companies to provide the needed PMVXG NMEA strings.  This would dramatically add cost and delays to the project with no significant savings or improvements for the Coast Guard.

(4)  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other that full and open competition.

6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
(a) Authority.
2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in? 
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or 
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).) 

 (5).  A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

Only one responsible source.  No other vender can meet the Coast Guard's legacy integration requirements. RAVEN? Invicta 210 is currently fielded, tested and is installed on more than 30 Coast Guard Cutters.

 (6).  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and , if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

Conducted Market research via the internet, conventions and trade show.  Other Receivers are available but none satisfy the Coast Guards legacy integration requirements. 

(7).  A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

Evaluated two additional sources of comparable items.  These machines do not meet the Coast Guard needs but can be used to show fair and reasonable cost. 
 
(8).  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.

Market research was completed and two comparables machines were evaluated but are not compatible with currently install equipment. 

(9).  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:

(i).  Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  

Not applicable.

(ii).  When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.

Buying a different DGPS receiver would quadruple the cost of the project and delay the field deployment by 1 year or more. 

(iii).  When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.

Same as above.

(10).  A listing of the sources , if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

None.

(11).  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

Will reevaluate the hardware and software requirements at the end of it?s life cycle.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-A)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

INTRODUCTION   	In 2005/2006 an unauthorized ATV Trail system was created in Recapture Wash, east of Blanding, Utah on lands administered by the Utah Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Monticello Field Office (MFO).  During the trail construction and because of subsequent trail use, direct damage has occurred to 6 cultural resource sites all eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.  BLM is required to evaluate cultural resources that have been deliberately or inadvertently damaged under its jurisdiction.  These requirements are mandated by the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) as amended 16U.S.C. 470aa-mm and 43CFR7.  These mandates outline the procedures required for producing a report for evaluating the damages (damage assessment) and the costs for emergency repair and restoration for each cultural site.   2.	BACKGROUND 	Sometime between November of 2005 and January of 2006, un-authorized all-terrain vehicle (ATV) trails were constructed on 18.8 miles of routes in and near Recapture Wash, San Juan County, Utah.  These ATV trails go through and/or near 31 archaeological sites.  Damage to the sites continues as the ATV trails are used.  The access now provided by these ATV trails also indirectly provides opportunities to vandalize these sites.  An inventory report entitled "Recapture ATV Trails Archaeological Survey, U-06-RM-1652b" by Don Keller details and initially records these sites.    		The BLM is required to evaluate cultural resources that have been deliberately or inadvertently damaged under its jurisdiction.  These requirements are mandated by the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA), as amended 16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm and 43CFR7.   	This contract covers the following work; 	a.	This contract concerns cultural resource evaluation as specified in 43CFR7.14 on public land.  The evaluation will be conducted to determine the archaeological value of the damage and the cost of restoration and repair for each archaeological site specified. 	b.	All work shall be preformed in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's "Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation" (Federal Register, Volume 48, Number 190), Thursday, September 29, 1983, page 44716).   3.	OBJECTIVES 	a.	To provide the BLM with a cultural resource evaluation of the damage to archaeological sites by the ATV trails and associated access for the project to be completed under this contract. 		b.		To provide information on the value of the archaeological damage and the cost of restoration and repair of the archaeological sites identified in this statement of work.  4.	STATEMENT OF WORK  		a. 	General 		(1) 	Six cultural sites, all eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places have been identified for evaluation under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA).  Maps of the project area and site reports/maps are included.   		(2) 	Cultural resources fieldwork shall include the cost of emergency restoration and repair and archaeological value, as specified in 43CFR7.14:  			Phase I: a. Cost of emergency restoration and repair i.e. those costs projected to be necessary to complete restoration and repair, which may include, but need not be limited to, the costs of the following: 	1.  Reconstruction of the archaeological resource; 	2.  Stabilization of the archaeological resource; 	3.  Ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization; 	4.  Research necessary to carry out reconstruction or stabilization; 	5.  Physical barriers or other protective devices, necessitated by the disturbance of the archaeological resource, to protect it from further disturbance; 	6.  Examination and analysis of the archaeological resource including recording remaining archaeological information, where necessitated by disturbance, in order to salvage remaining values which cannot be otherwise conserved; 	7.  Reinterment of human remains in accordance with religious custom and State, local, or tribal law, where appropriate, as determined by the Federal land manager. 	8.  Preparation of reports relating to any of the above activities. 			Phase II:  b. Archaeological value, i.e. the value of the information associated with the archaeological resource.  This value shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the scientific information which would have been obtainable prior to the damage.  These costs may include, but are not limited to, the cost of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out laboratory analysis, and preparing reports that would be necessary to realize the information potential. 		(3) 	Upon the completion of fieldwork, a draft formal report for emergency restoration and repair for the six sites shall be generated and submitted for review to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at the BLM's Monticello Field Office (MFO).  Following review and incorporation of comments, hard copies of a final report for emergency restoration and repair for the six sites shall be produced in triplicate, including all site documentation, photographs, maps, etc.  Two copies are to be submitted to the COR, who will forward one to the SHPO and retain the other in the files of the MFO.   After this report is completed, a second report for the archaeological value for each of the six sites will be generated and submitted for review The reports, site documentation, photos, GIS data, etc. shall be produced in digital form on duplicate disks or CDs, one of which is to be submitted to the COR for the MFO files and, in part, for the SHPO.

<CONTACT>Susan Cowin Contracting Officer 8015394177     susan_cowin@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management, Salt Lake City, Utah has a requirement for a contractor to perform Land Records Verification.  Proposed contract to include research and maintenance for final filing for specifically identified sections within the State of Utah.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number for this notice is JSQ074108. DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) 1.         BACKGROUND The BLM Utah State Office provides policy, liaison, assistance, and operational support for the management of approximately 22 million acres of BLM lands in Utah by approximately 950 full time federal employees. The Utah BLM State Office Division of Land Records documents both ownership and use for all lands under the oversight and protection of the Federal government in Utah.  To accomplish its mission, BLM is currently undertaking a number of initiatives to improve public access and respond to public queries concerning the use and care of our public lands.  Significant effort is now required to evaluate land records, claims, patents and rights of way issues prior to digitizing the existing land record information.  In many cases there will be a need to quickly respond to queries, resolve complex claim and ownership issues and document decisions such as use and ownership now prominent as a result of FLPMA.  The deliverables under this contract will be provided to the Utah BLM State Office Division of Land and Minerals through the Branch Chief of Lands and Realty. 2.	       PURPOSE OF CONTRACT This contract is for land records research, maintenance and preparation for final filing, disposition and transfer as applicable for specifically identified Sections within the State of Utah.  Research, analysis and maintenance workload will be apportioned based on Meridian, Township, Range and Section.  Sections with the Township will define the specific work package, hereafter referred to as the Section Work Package.  Section Work Package will be provided to the contactor to review current issues, patents and claims using public land record information available using the LR-2000 System, and official records including Master Title Plats (MTP) and other plats, Historical Indices (HI) and Controlled Document Index (CDI).  Upon completion of the contractor's review, a final report outlining specific issue, findings and recommendations pertaining to the specific Section Work Package will be completed and provided to Utah BLM State Office Branch Chief of Lands and Realty.  In addition to the written report, the contractor must be prepared to respond to questions and brief on any findings or recommendations made. 3.	       SCOPE OF CONTRACT Section Work Packages will be limited to only those packages found within the State of Utah.  Additionally, it is recognized that issues associated with the work necessary to evaluate Section Work Packages will vary based on the quality of  the records, information provided by claimants, previous rights-of-way decision, easements stipulation, conditions precedents and information and evidence provided when researching these Section Work Packages.  Therefore, the Branch Chief of Lands and Realty will review all Section Work Packages to classify them into one of three categories.  These categories and the basis for their classification is outlined in the deliverables section of the this SOW. In all cases, the contractor will be given access to the Utah State Office Public Room, BLM records staff and the official documents required including the Master Title Plats (MTP) and other plats, Historical indices (HI), and Controlled Document Index (CDI) microfiche media.  All information available from other sources (State, local individuals, Geospatial Data, maps etc.) pertinent to the analysis and review of the Section Work Packages will be made available to the contractor.  Based on the complexity and due date for final report/deliverable, it may be necessary for the contractor to have close interaction with the BLM staff to analyze key data components available through official records and make recommendations for appropriate action and delineation.  As Section Work Packages research, maintenance and preparations are completed, they will be evaluated to completeness and quality.  Occasionally complete Section Work Packages will be audited against official land records, Controlled Document Indices (CDI's), Historical Indexes (HI's) and Master Title Plats (MTP) held as official records for completeness. 4.           TASKS The work to be completed involves the following: Record Maintenance - When preparing the Section Work Packages for final review, scanning and filing, the contractor may be required to perform manual drafting and automation work in the maintenance of Land Status Records which include notations of rights-of-ways, mining claims, lands actions, patents, withdrawals, surveys data and other public lands actions.  To prepare Section Work Packages for final assembly, the contractor is expected to communicate with the realty staff, Adjudication Branch, and Field Offices to ensure information is complete prior to submission to the Branch Chief of Lands and Realty.  Deliverables under the contract will adhere to current BLM standards for automation of Master Title Plats (MTP), Historical Index, Controlled Document Index (CDI) records, and survey plats and notes.  The contractor will not be required to research and will not be assigned Section Work Packages related to an Oil and Gas Sale or Lease. Informal Feedback - As required based on issues surfaced during review of Section Work Packages, it may be necessary for the contractor to work individually with State BLM employees to provide on-the-job training in the process required to evaluate Section Work Packages, records, including annotation and updates of BLM records, in a fashion which conforms to the process model directed as the initial deliverable under this tack.  In the preparation of the initial process model, the contractor will provide recommendations to assist in BLM's transition of Section Work Packages into the Land Record Modernization Improvement Program (LR-MIP) to supplement, maintain to replace plats and other records using automation. Quality Control - Ensures quality control of records products to ensure accurate records.  This includes 1) reviewing completed work for adherence to standards incorporating field office input on quality and accuracy of plat information; 2) identifying and setting priorities in work and ensuring completion; 3) providing support to internal and external customers. Monthly Reports - Monthly reports will be provided to the Chief Branch of lands and Realty to document any issues or delays associated with record research and updating. 5.	 DELIVERABLES: Analysis and research will be assigned based on the boundaries and limitations as described by Meridian, Township, Range, and Section.  Section with the township will be described as the Section Work Package.  All Section Work Packages to be evaluated, analyzed, package and digitized under the contract will be categorized using three levels of complexity.  Section Work Packages submitted in response to specific tasking under this contract will have demonstrated the sufficient land records research, maintenance and preparation for final filing, disposition and transfer that was accomplished.  Section Work Packages will be provide to the contractor to review current issues, patents and claims using public land records information available using LR-2000 System and official records including MTP and other plats, HI, and CDI.  Upon completion of the contractor's review, a final report outlining specific issues, findings and recommendations pertaining to the specific Section Work Package will be completed and provided to the Branch Chief of Lands and Realty.  In addition to the written report, the contractor must be prepared to respond to questions and brief any findings or recommendations made. Specific deliverables required under this contract are provided as follows: Item #1. Report-Process Model (1 each).  Prior to beginning any work on any Section Work Package, the contractor will provide a written report outlining the approach, process, and format of the final Section Work Package product for review by the Branch Chief of Lands and Realty.

The system shall be capable of exploiting novel genetically encoded optical switches and caged biologically active compounds and thus must be designed to allow flexible 2-photon based uncaging deep within tissue with exquisite and user defined precision e.g. at cellular and subcellular resolution.  The system must also be compatible with coordinated electrophysiological recordings from the preparation undergoing imaging.

The 2-photon microscope system required for these types of experimental projects, must meet the following criteria: (1) 2-photon microscopy of various biological preparations ranging from tissue slices to whole animals (mice and rats) using a broad range of spectral excitation frequencies.  (2) 2-photon uncaging using a similar range of spectral excitation frequencies as a built in option.  (3) Ability to illuminate samples with conventional fluorescent illumination and visible light and to carry out electrophysiological recordings from the preparation being used for microscopy. (4)  The system shall have the ability to perform precise user-specified 2-photon uncaging and should use different galvanometers for scanning and uncaging.  (5)  The software controlling the system shall be designed to directly incorporate electrophysiological recording in parallel to imaging and uncaging.  (6)  The company shall supply and build a complete custom system including optical table and lasers and to coordinate with NIDCR investigators and Project Officers for the delivery of the complete system. (7)  The imaging system must be capable of fitting within the available imaging room with a 10 foot 6 inch square floor-plan.

To meet these requirements and in addition to them, the system must include the following specifications:  

1.	Automatic switching between two scanning methods:
a.	Standard Scanning ? uses X & Y galvanometer driven mirrors
b.	High Speed Scanning Option? uses Y galvanometer and Acousto Optic Deflector (AOD) for X scanning
i.	512 x ~512 pixels at 25 fps
ii.	Zoom factors of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 times.
2.	Systems may be upgraded to the high speed scanning option if it is not purchased initially.
3.	Laser input optics for two simultaneous beams.  One for the imaging optics and the second for uncaging (photolysis) applications.  This option is designed for use with two Ti: Sapphire lasers for simultaneous two-photon imaging and two-photon uncaging.  May be used with a single laser in an alternating mode between imaging and uncaging.
4.	Synchronization of imaging line scans, uncaging, and electrical recording data in a single computer.
5.	A total of six external non-descanned fluorescence detectors may be used simultaneously:
a.	Two or four  detectors located above the specimen
b.	Two detectors located below the specimen
6.	Laser delivery optics utilize a Pockels cell for laser power attenuation and beam blanking in order to minimize laser pulse dispersion and the need to pre-chirp the laser in the standard galvanometer based system.
7.	Transmitted Dodt gradient contrast detector allows simultaneous viewing of gradient contrast image and fluorescent images overlaid in the same or individual image windows.
During acquisition of z series data, the laser power and or the PMT high voltage can be automatically adjusted as a function of depth into the specimen.

Part 1: Model Enhancement for CLV Tank Explosion Scenarios.  Work requirements: 1.	Simulations to support risk assessment of the catastrophic disintegration of the CLV tank and the ensuing explosion risk are currently in progress. The work in this part requires performing simulations based on enhanced phase change models that more accurately model the physical scenario and include phase change due to a combination of flashing and heat transfer. Part 2: Risk Assessment of Common Bulkhead Failure Scenarios.  Work Requirements:  The risk scenarios to be assessed result from the failure of the baffle separating the two sections of the tank and leading to mixing between the LH2, LOX and the Oxygen vapor and Helium gas that are used to pressurize the LOX and LH2 respectively. Simulations are needed to accurately model these phenomena at various points in the launch trajectory from lift-off (when the tank is stationary) and in the subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic regimes as the vehicle gains speed and altitude.  It is anticipated that a systematic study of the risk scenarios would involve simulations at various points in the vehicle trajectory that are characterized by very different vaporization and combustion characteristics. These should include the following:  1.	Modeling common bulkhead failure on the launch pad: Here the tank is stationary at ground level. Gravity is expected to play a significant role in the mixing between the fluids. The following simulations are required: (1) mixing, vaporization and pressure rise in the tank due to baffle failure, (2) the parametric study of venting from the tank due to cracks from over-pressurization, with ensuing combustion. This could be performed by specifying vent hole configurations at different locations and modeling of the flow through the vent holes. Additionally, studies of slow external leaks from the tank while atmospheric air is available for combustion are also desired.  2.	Modeling common bulkhead at different altitudes and vehicle speeds: simulations of baffle failure at different operating points must be performed. The speed of the tank as well as the ambient pressure will vary depending on the altitude. Another important change will be the volume of liquid in the tanks. After the upper stage engine fires, the volume of liquid propellant in the tank will deplete. Therefore, the interaction process will be very different and could also lead to sloshing of the liquid in the tank (as discussed in number 3 below).  3.	Evaluation of liquid sloshing due to vehicle acceleration: After the upper stage engine ignites at some point in the vehicle trajectory, the propellant in the tank will start to deplete. As the volume of liquid reduces, more space is available in the tank for the liquid to slosh and generate large dynamic loads on the baffle. A preliminary evaluation of sloshing can be conducted by providing a displacement to the liquid interface to generate an initial instability. The subsequent movement/ sloshing of the liquid interface can be tracked numerically. The preliminary evaluation could be conducted for one trajectory point where the risk of sloshing is expected to be high.  4.	Assessment of requirements for unsteady/transient simulations of CLV tank with acceleration: A study needs to be conducted to evaluate the importance of unsteady acceleration from a risk assessment perspective. This study should result in a good understanding of the physics of the phenomena that needs to be captured/modeled and the requirements and methodology for accurate simulations.

The National Park Service encourages the participation of small, disadvantaged, veteran, and women owned business enterprises.  The following is a description of the requirements for this acquisition. 1.	Introduction.  Occupational fatalities caused by falls are a serious problem. When a worker is at a height of four feet or more, the worker is at risk to encountering a fall and needs to be protected. Fall protection must be provided at four feet in general industry, five feet in maritime and six feet in construction. However, regardless of the fall distance, fall protection must be provided when working over dangerous equipment, machinery and natural environments. The National Park Service under 29 CFR 1960 is required to provide a safe and healthful work environment to all of its employees. As part of this requirement the NPS must adhere to Directors Order 50 B (Occupational Safety and Health Program). This policy requires managers to establish a safety and health program for its employees.   During the course of a normal working day, some NPS employees may conduct work at heights greater than the OSHA allowable limits, where there is a potential risk of falling. As a result, those NPS sites are required to implement an effective site specific written fall protection program for its employees. 1.1 	The objective of this contract is to develop a National Park Service specific fall protection program manual.  This manual will provide both direction and serve as the written fall protection program manual necessary for implementing a comprehensive fall protection program at all parks: that complies with: a. DO 50 B Occupational Safety and Health Program b. NPS RM 50 B 3.10 Construction Safety c General Industry (29 CFR 1910) "	1910 Subpart D, Walking-working surfaces  "	1910.23, Guarding floor and wall openings and holes  "	1910 Subpart F, Powered platforms, manlifts, and vehicle-mounted work platforms  "	1910.66, Powered platforms for building maintenance  "	Appendix A, Guidelines (Advisory)  "	Appendix C, Personal fall arrest system (section I - mandatory; sections II and III - non-mandatory)  "	1910.67, Vehicle-mounted elevating and rotating work platforms [Aerial lifts]  "	1910 Subpart I, Personal protective equipment  "	1910.132, General requirements  "	1910.269, Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution  d.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR PART 13.105 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS IS A SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. 

The Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental health Services Administration requires a contractor to provide creating trainig materials for consumers, family members, and providers on developing peer support approaches for persons with co-occurring mental health, substance abuse problems, and somatic/physical health ailments.

Background:

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was created in 1992 to work in partnership with States to improve prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals with mental illness and substance abuse disorders. SAMHSA?s Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) provides national leadership for mental health service delivery improvements. One of SAMHSA?s stated priorities is in the area of mental health transformation.

Mental health transformation responds to the recommendations put forth by the 2003 final report of the President?s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, "Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America." Specifically, the commission cited that people with co-occurring disorders are inadequately served.  Further the commission cited as a primary goal the need for mental health care to be consumer and family driven.

Peer support approaches to serve people with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse problems have been cited as a promising practice.  These approaches, such as Double Trouble in Recovery, Dual Recovery Anonymous, and Dual Disorders Anonymous, can provide valuable support and assistance in promoting recovery.  There is a clear need for information on how such approaches can be developed in counties and states.

In addition, there is a need for information on how peer support approaches could assist in the needs of persons with mental illness with co-occurring physical or somatic illnesses.  This is particularly crucial given the high rates of early mortality and co-morbidity for people with mental illnesses.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, (for procurements between $100,000 and $500,000) hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

JUSTIFICATION

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity.

Agency: 
Defense Information Systems Agency 
PO Box 4502
Arlington, VA  22204-4502

Contracting Activity:
DITCO Scott
2300 East Drive
Scott AFB, Illinois  62225-5406
Phone: 618-229-9100

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s).

The proposed action is to award a contract to buy two storage systems called Storage Area Networks (SANs), one of which will be used as the data storage component of the DISA SIPRNet Tier 2 Security Information Manager (SIM) and one of which will be used as a the storage component of a lab baseline system for the former.  The SIM is used by DISA?s Information Assurance (IA) analysts to monitor, analyze, and report, and respond to attacks against the Global Information Grid (GIG).  

The SIPRNet Tier 2 SIM is currently located in a temporary facility at DISA Field Security Organization (FSO) that lacks 24x7 system administration support and that lacks reliable network connectivity.  A DISA mandate requires that all operational systems, such as the SIM, be moved into Defense Enterprise Computing Centers ASAP.  The DECCs utilize and support the brands and models of hardware that are on the DISA Computing Services Division (CSD) contracts for the DECCs.  To ensure compatibility and support after the move to the DECC, it is necessary to deploy equipment consistent with that used at and supported by the DECC.  Also, DISA?s SIM engineering, Certification, and Accreditation team at FSO requires in their lab a ?carbon copy? of deployed systems that they can use for interoperability testing and certification/accreditation testing.  

It is necessary to purchase the SANs described below because (1) The existing SIM?s SAN is not the same type as those used and supported at the DECCs; and, (2) The existing SAN has reached end of life and is no longer vendor supported ? that is, it is out of warranty.  

Without this purchase, it will not be possible to move the SIPRNet Tier 2 SIM from the temporary facility that lacks 24x7 support and reliable network connectivity to a DECC that has such support and connectivity.  This will result in continued intermittent extended periods of SIM downtime, increasing the amount of time between when attacks against the GIG occur and when analysts are able to detect, diagnose, and react to such attacks.  This, in turn, reduces the security posture of this critical DoD computer resource.  

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.

With this proposed award, Hitachi Data Systems or one of its resellers will provide DISA with the following:

?	One Hitachi brand AMS500 model Storage Area Network system Base Unit and Controller, 4 DF700 Fiber Channel storage expansion units, an AMS500 Fiber Channel interface with 2 ports, 64 300GB 10K RPM fiber channel hard disks (60 operational and 4 spares), 4 2GB cache memory cards, the AMS500 Resource Manager Utility Package license, a 19? rack for the AMS500 and expansion units
?	Advanced Installation Service for the AMS500
?	3 years Premium Level (24*7*4) Warranty services for the above AMS500 system
?	One Hitachi brand AMS200 model Storage Area Network system Base Unit and Controller, an AMS200 Fiber Channel interface with 2 ports, 15 300GB 10K RPM fiber channel hard disks (14 operational and 1 spare), 2 2GB cache memory cards, the AMS200 Resource Manager Utility Package license
?	Advanced Installation Service for the AMS200
?	3 years Premium Level (24*7*4) Warranty services for the above AMS200 system

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.

The statutory authority that will be used for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). 

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.

DISA is requesting the purchase of a specific brand and model of product, not the use of a specific reseller.

To ensure that the Tier 2 SIPRNet SIM?s storage components will fully supported by the DECC, DISA requires the purchase of the specific configuration of Hitachi brand AMS500 SAN described in this procurement package.  To ensure that the SIM lab baseline?s storage components used for interoperability testing, certification, and accreditation of the deployed SIM are functionally identical to and utilize identical utility and controller software as the deployed SIM, it is necessary to purchase the specific configuration of Hitachi brand AMS200 SAN described in this procurement package.

 Estimated value is [REDACTED].

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.  Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Section 4202 (10 U.S.C. 2304). The NETAPPS equipment is peculiar to one manufacturer.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.  

a. This equipment is a life cycle replacement for the  current Network Appliance F760 storage system. The FAS270-C Network Appliance Storage Array is used to support European Security Operations Center (ESOC) mission activities that are not supported by the DCGS-A and HIGHCASTLE programs.  National Security Agency (NSA) provides the ESOC funding to procure systems and software not covered under the current Army Program of Record.  

     b. Continuing the ESOC data storage with NetApps allows the node to take advantage of the 66th MI Group's existing Disaster Recovery Program (DRP) solution which was installed last year and uses NetApp Snap Mirror and Snap Restore. Both of the software programs are proprietary to NetApp hardware.  

     c. The ESOC continues to be inline with 66th MI Group's storage architecture and gives their node access to a larger number of experienced storage administrators. The purchase will provide four times the current storage, provide for better data security and meet stricter systems accreditation standards.  

     d. Using a variety of different data storage devices, not meeting the criteria identified above, would cause the following support issues:

(1)  Funding would be required to purchase PLL and ASL, as the current stocks are oriented toward supporting NetApps equipment.  
(2)  Funding for training on multiple vendors equipment would have be obtained to provide training to 66th MI Group. 
(3)  Funding would be required to initiate new maintenance and support contracts on any additional equipment.  

     e. In summary, the purchase of specific brand-name products enables the ESOC to simplify support, maintain the Enterprise Infrastructure and meet the operational requirements of the defense intelligence community.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources.  The solicitation will be posted on FedBiz Opps.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable  Price.   The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement among resellers of Net App equipment on FedBiz Opps. All brand name Network Appliance resellers who submit offers will be considered for award on a lowest cost, technically acceptable basis. The price to the Government will be determined fair and reasonable prior to award based upon competition.

8.  Description of Market Research. The requesting activity used the Army Small Computer Program website to determine interest, as well as contacting other vendors known to be able to supply the required NetApp equipment.

9.  Any Other Supporting Facts.  None	

10.  Listing of Interested Sources.  Interested sources include:  Apptis, Inc.; Merlin International, Inc.; and FCN Technology Solutions.

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.  None at this time.  Use of other than NetApp equipment would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule.  30-45 days ARO.

13.  Reference to the Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)/Program Plan (PP).  N/A.  AP not required.

<DESC>Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number SB1341-07-RP-0071 is issued as a request for quotation. This solicitation is set aside exclusively for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541690. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for technical support services for the Solar Photovoltaic Project.   

A.	Background Information

NIST is in the process of characterizing a new solar flash simulator and then using it to evaluate different methods for testing and rating photovoltaic products.  A qualified contractor is sought with prior hands-on photovoltaic testing and rating experience.  The need for this project was identified as part of the NIST United States Measurement Services (USMS) investigation.  

B.	Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain the services of someone who has considerable hands-on experience and can immediately contribute to characterizing the NIST solar flash simulator and take the lead on conducting tests that explore the effect of using progressively different testing and rating procedures.  Within the contract period, the objectives are to explore the limits and quantify the spectral and total irradiance performance of the solar simulator for Standard Rating Conditions testing, qualifying reference modules based on infrared imaging, conducting a series of preliminary tests that lead to the development of a first-generation protocol for using a reference module to calibrate the simulator (limited to single-junction modules having silicon crystalline solar cells), and then applying that protocol on a group of test specimens.

C.	Tasks

1 ? Solar simulator spectral measurements:  Contractor shall assist with deploying a high-speed spectroradiometer to measure the spectral distribution of the NIST long-pulse solar simulator.   Contractor shall evaluate and document spectral characteristics of the NIST solar simulator:  from flash to flash, center of test plane versus edge of test plane, impact of two levels of the capacitive stored charge setting, impact of two interference gratings, impact of separation distance between lamp and test plane (center and edge), impact of the EADS Astrium adjustable filter when fully deployed and when halfway deployed, effect of masking the test sensor with a large-area module, and variation of spectrum for one set-up configuration over multiple weeks.  

2 ? Solar simulator total irradiance measurements: The Contractor shall evaluate and document the spatial variation of the total irradiance within the solar simulator test plane:   evaluate for two different separation distances between the lamp and the test plane, two different charge settings, with and with and without one of the interference gratings deployed.  For one configuration, the Contractor shall also evaluate the impact of the EADS Astrium filter when fully deployed.   

3 ? Deployment of module and monitor cell/reference cell temperature measurement system:  The Contractor shall assist with deployment of separate data acquisition system for measuring the backside temperatures of the photovoltaic module (reference or test specimen) and the simultaneously deployed monitor or reference cell.  The Contractor shall investigate the temperature distribution observed over the backside of two selected test modules using a minimum of 10 temperature sensors.  The Contractor shall consider both the single-flash case and a multi-flash case using 5 flashes.  The Contractor shall make recommendation for the maximum number of sensors needed and guidelines for the placement of those sensors on future test specimens.  The Contractor shall report the range of temperature rise observed.  Initially, the Contractor shall make recommendation based on applications to single-junction modules using crystalline silicon cells.  

4 ? Solar simulator test table enhancements:  The Contractor shall assist with modifications to the test table used to create the test plane.  Planned modifications include:  (1) add support elements to accommodate flexible photovoltaic panels, (2) create a test plane that is ?marked? using a LED/light pointer, (3) table ?feet? jacks to permit a mechanism for varying the height of the table top by as much as 5 inches so that test specimens of different thicknesses can be more readily positioned with their photovoltaic cells in the designated test plane, (4) stable mounting mechanism for the reference/monitor cell so that it can be positioned anywhere in the test plane, and (5) devising and implementing a mechanism for consistently positioning test specimens within the test plane.  

5 ? Develop a first generation test protocol when using a reference module for single-junction modules having silicon crystalline cells:  The Contractor shall assist with a design of experiment (something less than a full factorial design) and then conduct testing to help develop a protocol for testing PV modules using a reference module:  (1) number of flashes before repeatable lamp performance, (2) minimum time interval between successive flashes, (3) placement of reference module and test module, (4) trace IV curve from open circuit to short circuit or vice versa, (5) separation distance between lamp and test plane, (6) conducting the calibration step based on matching Isc or Pmpp, (7) amount of data points and number of sections of load curve, (8) maximum allowed deviation of total irradiance from target irradiance of 1000 W/m2 for a valid test, (9) maximum deviation of panel temperature from a target temperature of 25??C for a valid test, (10) start reference (based on a certain light intensity level or with initiation of flash) and the duration of the delay thereafter before initiation of IV curve trigger, and (11) duration of IV data collection interval.  For now, address items (4) to (11) based on testing single-junction modules using crystalline silicon cells and operating the solar simulator in a single flash mode and with the EADS Astrium filter fully retracted.  

6 ? Reference module baseline tests:  The Contractor shall conduct baseline IR imaging tests on three polycrystalline and one single-crystalline reference modules and document the results.  

7 ? Measure full range of in-house photovoltaic test specimens in accordance with IEC Standard 60904-6: In accordance with IEC Standard 60904-6 and otherwise using the test protocol develop in above Task #5, the Contractor shall conduct testing on a minimum of 40 test specimens to determine their rated performance at Standard Rating Conditions (1000 W/m2, Air Mass 1.5, 25??C panel temperature).  The Contractor shall conduct multiple flash tests on each specimen once installed in the solar simulator.  The Contractor shall repeat the entire testing process on the entire test specimen population a minimum of 4 times.  Time consuming elements will be the careful uncrating and re-crating of test specimens (some of which are very large and heavy) and the initial set-up of each test specimen.  

8 ? Progress reports: The Contractor shall prepare a progress report that summarizes the results from each of the above Tasks, 1-7, except Task 4. The Contractor shall submit each progress report in electronic format (MS Word and MS Excel) to the NIST Technical Information Contact (TIC) for review and approval.    

D.	Government Responsibilities
The Government shall furnish both the solar simulator and the diagnostic tools and hardware elements needed to conduct the above described tasks.  Except for the progress reports, all the work shall be conducted on the NIST Gaithersburg campus as the NIST solar simulator is a large apparatus that cannot be moved now that it has been integrated into a NIST laboratory.  The contractor may choose to work on the progress reports at his home office.

E.	Reporting Requirements and Deliverables
See the ?Tasks? section above.

F.	Program Management and Control Requirements
The contractor shall not be allowed out-of-hours access to the NIST campus.  All work on the NIST campus must be conducted during normal business hours:  7:00 am to 7:00 pm every weekday, excluding any site-wide closures due to holidays, weather-related closures, or other special circumstances.

G.	Inspection and Acceptance Criteria
The NIST Technical Information Contact (TIC) shall inspect and approve or disapprove all measurement test result submissions as well as each progress report to determine their acceptability and conformance to the contract requirements within two weeks after receipt of each deliverable.  Contractor invoices shall be approved for payment based upon the acceptance of said progress reports.

Any leak greater than one square inch will require replacement of filter at contractor expense.
*In Place HEPA Filter Testing. Field test and provide written certification of all HEPA filter units with Polyalphaolefin (PAO) after installation to verify that the filters do not contain pinhole leaks in the filter media, the bond between the filter media and the filter frame and the filter frame gasket to filter housing. Filter testing is intended to be completed in a similar manner to industry standards for certification of HEPA filters in Biological Safety Cabinets. Approved Testing Procedure:
        1)    Utilize an aerosol photometer with either a linear or a logarithmic scale and a threshold sensitivity of at least 1 x 10 -3 micrograms per liter for 0.3 micrometer diameter PAO particles and a capacity for measuring 80-120 micrograms per liter concentration. The air sampling rate shall be at least1 cfm. The photometer must be calibrated within the past calendar year. The PAO generator shall be the Laskin nozzle(s) type which generates an aerosol of PAO particles by flowing air through liquid PAO. The compressed air supply to the generator shall be adjusted to 20 psi, measured at the entrance to the nozzle and downstream of all restrictions. The nozzles shall be with liquid PAO to a depth not to exceed 1 inch.   2)    Adjust the air flow to approximately 10 percent of the design air flow rate of the filter. Place the PAO generator to uniformly introduce PAO aerosol upstream of the HEPA filter. Measure and record the upstream PAO concentration approximately in the center of the filter face.  For linear readout photometers (graduated 0_100), adjust the instrument to read 100 percent while using at least one Laskin type nozzle per 500 cfm airflow, or increments thereof. For logarithmic readout photometers, adjust the upstream concentration to 1 x 10-4 above the concentration necessary for one scale division (using the instrument calibration curve). 3)     With the nozzle of the photometer probe not more than 1 inch from the surface, scan the downstream side of the HEPA filters by passing the probe over the entire filter surface in slightly overlapping strokes. Scan the entire periphery of the filter, and the junctions between the filter media and the filter frame, and the filter frame and the housing. Scanning shall be done at a transverse rate of not more than 2 inches per second. 4)    Identify and repair all points of leakage which exceed 0.01 percent of PAO penetration at any point, measured by a linear or logarithmic photometer for acceptance.Initial performance verification testing of three BSL3 laboratoriesReview electronic readout of each BSL3 space and calculate air changes per hour.Confirm directional airflow at each door using smoke.
Compare each magnehelic gauge reading at each door against a calibrated differential pressure monitor.  Adjust magnehelic gauge as needed.
Compare each electronic pressure monitoring device against a calibrated differential pressure monitor.  Calibrate device as needed.
Test exhaust fan redundancy by disabling single exhaust fan.  System should maintain normal operations (pressure differentials).
Test supply/exhaust interlock by disabling all exhaust fans.

Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  Requirement:  Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour (HPV) generator should be manufactured with a ?dual? circuit technology and operate with a ?wet? vapour process under low concentration.  The technology utilises the free radicals generated from hydrogen peroxide vapour to bio-deactivate micro-organisms ? and once the bio-deactivation process has finished the hydrogen peroxide vapour is catalytically converted to water and oxygen.  The HPV generator should also offer a self-weight of less than 50 lbs and no dryer or catalyst recharge to be required. This combined with an ?in-room? bio-decontamination solution allowing the design and integration of a hydrogen peroxide vapour system with or without fixed wall ports offering significant operator flexibility.  The Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor Generator shall be used to provide residue-free bio-decontamination in enclosures such as bio-safety cabinets and incubators. The Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor Generator shall be able to decontaminate an enclosure up to 350 cubic ft. in size.  At a minimum, the Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor Generator shall be portable, self-contained and have a dual loop closed circuit for vaporization and catalytic decomposition.  It shall have the ability to decontaminate a room up to 350 cubic feet in size, not weigh over 50 lbs, and not have the need to have a catalyst or dryer or recharge required.   The Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor Generator shall produce hydrogen peroxide vapor by flash evaporating an aqueous non proprietary hydrogen peroxide solution (30-35% wet/weight) on a hot plate into a warm air stream. The cycle progression must include the following, but not limited to: Conditioning ? The decontamination will warm itself up to approximately 110-130 C for proper vaporization of H202 Gassing ? The H2O2 gas shall be introduced into the enclosure until the desired level is obtained, then it and the water vapor concentration shall be maintained at a constant level. Aeration ? The remaining H2O2 gas shall be catalytically decomposed into its degradation components of water and oxygen and the enclosure is ventilated.  The Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor Generator must be able to be placed internally inside the enclosure to be bio-decontaminated, thus not requiring alterations to the building.  An operator interface screen shall be positioned externally to the enclosure in this configuration to allow operation of the Generator without exposure of the operator to the hydrogen peroxide vapor. The Generator shall distribute hydrogen peroxide vapor through a rotating fan directing the hydrogen peroxide vapor throughout the enclosure. In addition H202 will be pulled from the enclosure back out through any filters, allowing the chamber to be decontaminated at a negative pressure. The room shall be aerated at the conclusion of the bio-decontamination cycle by use of two small portable catalytic converters that are hooked up to the gas generator or the building HVAC. The ?internal? catalyst is located within the equipment to be bio-decontaminated and, is automatically activated. The ?external? catalyst is located outside the equipment and helps maintain negative pressure inside the enclosure while removing H202 during aeration. A handheld low level hydrogen peroxide gas detector shall be needed to perform regular instantaneous low level leak checks.  The detector shall contain an internal sample pump and a flexible sampling wand to allow pinpoint location of the source of hydrogen peroxide leakage. The character display on the detector shall be large with a backlight for ease of use.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 04 - THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE RESPONSES TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY OFFEROR

Question:  In considering a decision to bid on this work, I would like to know whether it is open to the actual vendor of the design, Westinghouse, or whether they are precluded because of a conflict of interest. In this regard, I would appreciate any related clarification of Conflict of Interest requirements for this solicitation.


NRCs Response:  This is a full and open competition which restricts no firm from proposing on the training requirement for AP 1000.  The course material is publicly available information and is not proprietary technology.  

Please refer to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR) Subpart 2009.5 on Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI).  

The clause below is hereby incorporated into the terms and conditions of this combined synopsis/solicitation:

2052.209-72 CONTRACTOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
(JAN 1993)
 
   (a)  Purpose.  The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that the contractor:
 
     (1)  Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to the work under this contract; and
 
     (2)  Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.
 
   (b)  Scope.  The restrictions described apply to performance or participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the activities covered by this clause.
 
   (c)  Work for others.
 
     (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to forego entering into consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract.  The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by the provision of this clause.  If the contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such contractual arrangement.
 
     (2)  The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the services within the scope of this contract (or task order as appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.
 
     (3)  When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task order contract).
 
     (4)  When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,
 
       (i)  The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate.
 
       (ii)  The contractor may not perform work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.
 
       (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical bias or unfair competitive advantage.
 
   (d)  Disclosure after award.
 
     (1)  The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2.
 
     (2)  The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer.  This statement must include a description of the action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.  The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if termination is in the best interest of the Government.
 
     (3)  It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities.  Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the underlying contract.  Further, if this contract involves work at a licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant site.  This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer.  The disclosure must include the statement of work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated utility or other regulated entity.  NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section.
 
   (e)  Access to and use of information.
 
     (1)  If in the performance of this contract, the contractor obtains access to information, such as NRC plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), the contractor agrees not to:
 
       (i)  Use this information for any private purpose until the information has been released to the public;
 
       (ii)  Compete for work for the Commission based on the information for a period of six months after either the completion of this contract or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to: 1) change the "evaluation" statement, and 2) answer questions.

*Contractor must acknowledge receipt of all amendments in quotation.


1. EVALUATION: Contractor must be familiar with the scientific, medical device review and regulatory environment to effectively and efficiently facilitate post market transformation related discussions. Offers are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose quotation provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as quotations become more equal based on the other factors.

2.) Questions and Answers:

QUESTION:
Is the intent of Amendment 3 to delete the original intention of this project being a ?woman-owned?, small business set aside and instead open it to all small businesses?

ANSWER:
Yes, the requirement is a Total Small Business Set aside.


QUESTION:
Amendment 2 restated the SOW and seemed to incorporate several pieces of the original Synopsis.  Is the original ?evaluation? clause contained in the Synopsis deleted?

ANSWER:
No. The only thing that changed in amendment 2 was the Statement of Work, everything else remained the same.


QUESTION:
If the Evaluation clause is not deleted from the SOW, what is the intention of having the contractor be familiar with the scientific, medical device review and regulatory environment, including post market transformation effort? 

ANSWER:
The implementation of the matrix organization structure will result in a need to facilitate greater information sharing and richer collaboration across the Center which will overlay ?horizontal,? product-focused Networks on existing ?vertical? functional Offices calling for establishment of product-based Networks that will include all of the products the Center regulates, plus several over-arching groups covering cross-cutting science and regulatory issues.  The retreat, as a result of this structure, will require OCER managers to focus on how the Office, and the products it produces, will fit into the networks of the new matrix organization.  In order to effectively and efficiently facilitate discussion to determine the knowledge, skills and abilities required of OCER within the networks, the number of network liaisons OCER will require based on the work to be performed, as well as to determine which functions should be a part of the new matrix it is necessary to have a facilitator that is able to offer a familiarity with the medical device review process, as well as with the culture and/or nomenclature of the device review and regulatory community. 

Familiarity with the matrix effort is not a requirement.  The reference was intended to indicate that the contractor needed to be familiar with the scientific medical device review and regulatory environment to effectively facilitate the post market transformation discussions. 


QUESETION:
Is there a page limitation to what we can send?

ANSWER:
20 pages

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions.

*Contractor must acknowledge receipt of all amendments in quotation.

1.)  Is this an RFQ or an RFP?

ANSWER:
RFQ


2.)  May these tasks be subcontracted out?  If so does the subcontractor also need to be a SBE and WBE? How much of the coaching and facilitation is to be done by telephone and how much in person?

ANSWER:
1. No these tasks may not be subcontracted out. 
2. Yes the company must be a small business.
3. All coaching/facilitation is to be done in person.


3.) Must the firm who receives this opportunity be based in Rockville, MD?  

ANSWER:
No, but the vendor must be available to conduct the coaching in person and the tasks may not be subcontracted.


4.) Is the 150 total project hours expected to be on-site?  

ANSWER:
Yes


5.) How much of the 150 hours be dedicated to 1/1 exec coaching?

ANSWER:
The entire 150 hours will be dedicated to 1/1 coaching.


6.)  Realizing that the facilitation needs to be done on site, do you need all coaching done on-site or by the more traditional means of telephonic and e-mail coaching?  

ANSWER:
The expectation is that all coaching is to be done in person


7.)  The solicitation states 2.5 hours per month but 150 hours per year is 12.5 monthly.  Is this a typographical error?  

ANSWER:
No, there are 5 executive staff members.
2.5 hours per month, 5 people for 12 months = 150 hours (2.5*5-12.5 * 12 = 150)


8.) We serve several vertical markets including medical & science, but the term familiar is vague, how familiar, how in-depth?  Any additional specifics you can provide before we take the time to submit our proposal would be much appreciated.

ANSWER:
We are seeking knowledge of or familiarity with the medical device review process, the culture and, or nomenclature of the device review and regulatory community. 


9.) The Synopsis/Solicitation states: "Coaching and Facilitation = 2.5 hours a month for 12 months (150 hours total)." I think that is a typo, maybe it should read 12.5 hours per month.

ANSWER:
There are 5 executive staff members to receive coaching.  At 2.5 hours per month, 5 people for 12 months = 150 hours (2.5*5-12.5 * 12 = 150)


10.)  If so, does that mean that 12.5 hours per month will be in two consecutive days per month or spread out (2 hours one week, 1 hour another, etc.)?

ANSWER:
The schedule will be decided between the coach and recipient, but it is anticipated that the days per month will not always/likely be consecutive.


11.) Will any of these hours be via phone consultation?   

ANSWER:
No, the expectation is that all coaching is to be done in person


12.) Can you give any further qualifications on what *familiar* means as where the solicitation states *familiar with the scientific, medical device review and regulatory environment*? Can you give us a sense of what level of familiarity is sought and also how heavily this factor will be weighted upon review? 

ANSWER:
We are seeking knowledge of/familiarity with the medical device review process, the culture and/or nomenclature of the device review and regulatory community. Because of the positions and levels of the professionals being coached it is a significant requirement and factor.


13.) Are you able to say if all coaching work will be done in-person or if any phone coaching is anticipated? 

ANSWER:
No, the expectation is that all coaching is to be done in person


14.) We infer from the hours projected that 5 people will be involved in this coaching. Are the one person and their team? Or are the all at the same level, colleagues within OCER? 

ANSWER:

There are 5 professionals to be coached.  They are at differing levels (Director, Deputy, Special Assistant, etc..).


15.) Do you have any preference for format or information provided in the responses? 

ANSWER:

PDF or Word.


16.) How many people will be involved, this is needed for the price of testing (Myers-Briggs and 
360 degree). 

ANSWER:
There are 5 professionals to be coached.  It is understood that all have had the MBTI and all but possibly one have had the 360 degree.


17.) The second is: can the 12.5 hours be scheduled a month in advance through out the year?

ANSWER:
The schedule will be decided between the coach and recipient, based on respective calendars. Based on the level and potential needs it may be reasonable to anticipate that not all of the coaching can be scheduled in that manner.  


18.) Please confirm the due date is Tuesday, Sept4th and not Thursday, Sept. 7th.  The posting shows Thursday, Sept. 4th.

ANSWER:
Correct, the due date for quotations to be returned is no later than 2:00pm EST, Tuesday, September 4, 2007


19.)  Your announcement says "2.5 hours a month for 12 months (150 hours total)."  I can't make the math work out, even if you meant 2.5 hours a week.  Is there additional information to help explain the total number of hours?

ANSWER:
There are 5 executive staff members to receive coaching.  At 2.5 hours per month, 5 people for 12 months = 150 hours (2.5*5-12.5 * 12 = 150)


20.)  Leadership Assessment 360 Survey--Is this the Leadership Effectiveness Analysis Survey?  Or is it possibly the OPM Leadership 360?

ANSWER:

Leadership Effectiveness Analysis Survey


21.)  Why is this needed now?

ANSWER:
It is indicated that the contractor must be familiar with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator testing, and the Leadership Assessment 360 Degree Survey.  It is understood MBTI and 360 degree surveys have been done on most if not al.  The intent is that the coaching can include effective dialogue and support that may involve the results of the tests.


22.)  Why seek an outside consultant vs. someone internal?  

ANSWER:

An outside expert is better apt to help get to the root cause and to make fundamental changes


23.)  Have services such as these been tried before with these groups?  With what results?

ANSWER:
Such services have been utilized with very effective results.  


24.)  What will success look like after 12 months?

ANSWER:
Engagement that creates a trusting and open space for the recipient and/or their team to do their best and most important work.  Opening the recipient to looking at new perspectives, possibilities, choices and solutions


25.)  How will success be evaluated?  What metrics are available now to track right away?  Will the absence of certain conflict behaviors be perceived as success?

ANSWER:
That will have to be determined/defined between the coach and the recipient.


26.)  Are individuals from Human Resources involved in this project?  If so, in what role?

ANSWER:
No


27.)  What job levels and titles are involved?  

ANSWER:
Director, Office of Communication, Education and Radiation Programs.  As well as their Deputy Directors, Special Assistant and Program Management Officer.


28.)  What performance appraisal criteria are linked with the desired behaviors?  

ANSWER:
That will differ per person and will have to be determined/defined between the coach and the recipient.


29.)  How will individuals be rewarded for using new behaviors, other than excellent performance ratings?

ANSWER:
That will differ per person and will have to be determined/defined between the coach and the recipient.


30.)  Do individuals already give and receive 360-degree feedback?  Has there been any improvement in team behaviors since this feedback has been provided?

ANSWER:

There are 5 professionals to be coached.  It is understood that all have had the MBTI and all but possibly one have had the 360 degree.  Improvement and feedback as a result would differ per person and would have to be discussed between the coach and the recipient.


31.)  Has an outside vendor provided services similar to this in the last two years?  If so, will that vendor receive first consideration for this new work?

ANSWER:
There has been an outside vendor that has provided these services in the last two years.  This requirement is open for competition among small businesses; all potential offerors will receive the same consideration for the quotation submitted.


32.)  What is the range of budgeted dollars for this project?

ANSWER:
The government estimate is not for release, the contractor should ensure that their proposal is their best offeror. 


33.) The combined synopsis/solicitation states: "This is a total small, woman-owned business set-aside." Does it mean "small" and/or "women" owned or only women owned? 

ANSWER:
The solicitation has been amended to remove the *woman owned* set-aside. The requirement is a total small business set-aside.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  All persons responding must reference solicitation number H92239-07-T-0054 which is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-19.  It is the contractor?s responsibility to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions.  Full text clauses are available at farsite.hill.af.mil.  

This requirement is a total 100% small business set aside.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334220 and the size standard 750 employees.

I.  REQUIREMENT:

The Contractor shall provide the following items as specified as the requirement is Brand Name only.  The 112th Signal Battalion requires purchasing four (4) each L-band fiber optic transceiver systems (shelter) model number AC1209L, four each L-band fiber optic transceiver systems (remote) AC1209L-R and eight each fiber optic jumper cables J-Im4-TFOCA2-FC/APC.  The fiber modems are used to extend the RF capability in order to support Phoenix satellite terminals and baseband communications equipment for the Battalion. Currently the 112th are using two sets of these models for fiber modems to provide services in the CENTCOM AOR.  Four (4) more of these sets are needed and it is needed as well that they are compatible with the set presently in use in order for the Phoenix systems can be operated  remotely and TDMA signals sent without changing any protocols or dropping the shot.  This will also cause less down time to troubleshoot a component that is not compatible with our existing architecture.  The modems required must also meet the following specifications:

?	The RF path must have transmit and receive isolation on the link
?	The modem must have an Ethernet interface using a single fiber strand.
?	The modem set will need to be furnished with a 1000M 4 channel single mode fiber reel with TFOCA II ends.  This will also require a 2 ea TFOCA II fan-out per modem set (2 meters long) with FC ends on the fan-out ends.
?	The modem must have LED status indicators for both the optics side of the links as well as the RF and Ethernet side of the links.
?	The modem must have an LED status indicator for power state.
?	The modem must be matched to 75 Ohm impedance.
?	RF Link gain must be between -2dBm to +2dBm
?	Modem optical interfaces must be SM FC/APC
?	Modem RF interfaces must be N type
?	Ethernet interface must be 8x8 Rj45
?	Link will be modeled for 1--- meters
?	The input to the optical transmitter must be capable of withstanding signal levels of -40 to 0dBm(+10dBm as absolute maximum) (RF Uplink)
?	RF Downlink maximum RF input to fiber optic transmitter is less than 0dBm.
?	Modems must operate in temperatures of -30 Degrees C to 75 Degrees C.
?	Modems will be designed to fit in standard 19 inch rack mounts, with front and rear supports.

Along with the material support of acquiring the modems the 112th requires technical support in order to ensure that this equipment is compatible with our Phoenix Satellite Communications Systems:

Pre-Engineering Support:  Vendor will be required to visit the installation location, 112th Signal Battalion, Fort Bragg, NC and meet with the 112th engineers to determine specific engineering and functionality requirements of the Fiber to RF modems.   Tasks would include pre-engineering design discussions and assessment of required RF component interfaces.  This work should be accomplished in 24 work hours.

Post-Engineering Support:  Vendor will be required to visit the same installation site and assist with the initial installation of equipment.  Tasks would include fault discovery and troubleshooting, product acceptance testing and delivery acceptance testing, initial item training and familiarization, and engineering recommendations for product improvement.  This will be considered complete when the 112th engineers are able to remote the modems from the terminal and see no degradation of RF performance.  This work shall as well be accomplished in 24 work hours.  The installation, testing and training shall take place at the 112th Signal Battalion motor pool area (Building E-4166).  The hours of operation will be during the regular duty hours of 0900 ? 1700.

Site Visit: A coordinated site visit will be scheduled for all interested vendors wishing to submit a proposal.  Vendors are encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity.  No individual site visits will be scheduled. All vendors desiring a site visit shall notify Ms. Valaida Bradford via e-mail at bradforv@soc.mil  not later than 4:00 P.M. EST 28 August 2007.

<CONTACT>Susan Cowin Contracting Officer 8015394177     susan_cowin@blm.gov;
<DESC>Solicitation is hereby amended to add the following: Contractor Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements  Performance of this contract requires contractor personnel to have a Federal government-issued personal identification card before being allowed unsupervised access to a DOI facility and/or information system. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will be the sponsoring official, and will make the arrangements for personal identify verification and card issuance.  At least two weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor will identify all contractor and subcontractor personnel who will require physical and/or logical access for performance of work under this contract. The Contractor must make their personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR in order to initiate screening and background investigations. The following forms, or their equivalent, will be used to initiate the credentialing process: o OPM Standard Form 85 or 85P o OF 306  o Fingerprint card (local procedures may require the fingerprinting to done at a police station; in this case, any charges are to be borne by the contractor) o Release to Obtain Credit Information o PIV card application (web-based) Contractor employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. Government personnel may contact the contractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for such contact.  Alternatively, if an individual has already been credentialed by another agency through OPM, and that credential has not yet expired, further investigation may not be necessary. Provide the COR with documentation that supports the individual's status.  During performance of the contract, the Contractor will keep the COR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes. Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 24 hours. Replacement will be at the contractor's expense. If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it will be coordinated through the COR.  At the end of contract performance, or when a contractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the Contractor will ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COR.  Before starting work under this contract, a National Agency Check (NAC) will be conducted to verify the identity of the individual applying for clearance. Upon successful completion of the NAC process, an identification card will be issued and access granted.  Simultaneously, a NAC with Inquiries (NACI) will be initiated to determine the individual's suitability for the position. If the NACI adjudication is favorable, nothing more needs to be done. If the adjudication is unfavorable, the credentials will be revoked. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of an individual to perform work under this contract, DOI shall have the right of final determination.  This requirement must be incorporated into any subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have regular and routine unsupervised access to a Federally controlled facility for more than 180 calendar days or any unsupervised access to a Federally controlled Level 3 or 4 information system.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance of work will be based upon the review of the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  All deliverables and reports shall be inspected and approved by the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  Project completion will culminate upon receipt and approval of all deliverables and the project briefing to the Diabetes Branch Chief, David M. Harlan, M.D., Captain, U.S. Public Health Service, Building 10, CRC Room 5-5940, Bethesda, MD  20892.

The Government will evaluate the quality of the vendor?s past performance based on the information obtained from references provided by the vendor, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the vendor concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.

Technical Evaluation Criteria for Proposal

Please refer to the table at the end of this section for the scoring scheme that will be used to evaluate all proposals.  

A.	Security (17 points)

Provide a secure environment for patients to enter/download data and for patient-clinician communication.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the vendors experience in constructing secure websites for handling confidential data. 

B.	Blood Glucose Meter Data Download (17 points)

The vendor will be judged on experience with downloading data from multiple BG meters.  

C.	Website Design (17 points)

Provide clear and usable graphical interfaces for data entry by patients. Data includes numeric measurements and textual communication.  Proposals will be evaluated on general web programming experience and clarity in previous projects. Preference will be given to proposals demonstrating experience in diabetes-related clinical trial data.

D.	Data Extraction (17 points)

The vendor must demonstrate appropriate programming capability to enable the download of accumulated data to clinicians (fellows, nurse practitioners, and their supervisors) and investigators in appropriate formats.

Special reports will be required to monitor the performance of individual care providers, display scientific data using particular search criteria, etc.  For example, we may need to know: (1) How often does doctor X correspond with his/her diabetic patients?  (2) How do patients followed by clinical team 1 do compared to patients followed by clinical team 2?  (3)  How many patients are being managed by each care provider?  These and other questions can be formulated only after we have experience with the system.  Therefore, the proposals will be evaluated based on the ability to develop and incorporate new reports.  The use of a standard report writer is preferred.

Past Performance

The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror?s past performance based on information obtained from the references provided by the offeror, as well as other sources known to the Government.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on all standards of acceptable performance.  
The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.

Past performance will not be scored, but the Government?s conclusions about overall quality of the offeror?s past performance will be influential in determining the merits of the offeror?s proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the Government.

By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s record of forecasting and controlling costs; the offeror?s adherence to contract behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offer?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer, the offeror?s performance in clinically-related areas,

The Government will consider the number of severity of an offer?s problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the offeror?s overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information.

The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror. 

Past Performance Information:  Vendors must submit a listing of the most recent contracts/awards (minimum of 3) which demonstrate similar work in nature to this  Statement of Work.  Contracts/awards may include those entered with the Federal Government, state and local governments and commercial concerns. Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to cover the fact that a site visit was held today as stated in the solicitation. The site visit lasted from 0940 to 1040 hrs. We went around the room clarifying the customers requirement. Few measurements were taken. All requirements and specifications are in accordance with the product descriptions. The additional following information was stated. Some things were not discussed but are left in this memorandum for consolidation purposes. End user shall be responsible for disconnecting existing PA system. Requested wall plates are regular typical wall plates. End user did not specify specific manufacturer or part numbers for these items. There are 3 projectors, 2 stationary, 1 mobile. When all 3 are to be used simultaneously end user prefers all 3 to display same images. Within this central dinning area there are 4 zones that can be separated by manual removable walls. There is a crawl space between the ceiling and roof. Post award, installation times will have to be coordinated with end user. Installation will have to be done outside of normal business hours. Club is closed on Mondays, so this will be a possible day for installation efforts. A certified electrician may be necessary, but is not a part of this requirement. The contractor will be held responsible for any errors or miscalculations in their offer. A site visit took place 30 August 2007, 0940 hrs PST; no further site visits are scheduled. In no event shall failure to attend the site visit constitute grounds for a claim after contract award. Contractors must ensure they completely understand the customers requirement prior to submitting their offer.

Question
Within the description of the room environment for the Commander's Conference Room there is no detail on the floor construction.

When considering the preferred usage of table top microphones for more direct pickup as well as control panel and notebook interface and all the required wiring what is the provision or thought for modifying the room to allow for the cable runs to the table?  Is there the availability to core
drill up from a lower floor level?  Is the room being totally renovated and would allow for channeling out of the floor from the table to the wall location?  We typically prefer not to use an excess of "trip strip" cable covering because of the liability, durability and aesthetic reasons.

Utilizing cable umbilical loops to run notebook and control panel locations also has the same drawbacks as using the "trip strips".

Answer
The floor is a raised concrete slab, about 3-4 feet above ground. There is a crawl space in between, so core drilling can be done. The Commander's conference room is not being renovated, but the training room is (primarily new carpet and paint). We do not plan to replace the carpet in the Commander's conference room, so we don't know if channeling out the floor is a good possibility. 

Question
With regards to the "Optional" (2x) 42" Flat Panels requested for the Training Room:
Are these to display the same image as the Projector for wider viewing availability or will they be required to display individual images separate from the Projector?

The reason is that if they are to be independent it necessitates a shift in the capabilities of the signal switcher to a more advanced unit to accomplish these goals versus just displaying the same image on (3) displays.

Answer
They are to display the same information as the projector.

DAY, NIGHT USING AVAILABLE STREET LIGHTING.  WILL GET CLARIFICATION FOR THIS. jj.	We will need complete site drawings to determine the location and number of cameras, trenching distance, cable requirements, etc.  A COMPLETE SITE DRAWING IS NOT AVAILABLE.  WE HAVE AN OVERVIEW, PLEASE EMAIL stephanie.murphree@conus.army.mil TO REQUEST  A COPY. kk.	 DLP is not a technology for cameras.  Do you mean DSP?  If so, why DSP?  There are newer processing CPUs that deliver even greater processing power for powering full behavioral video analytics.  YES, DSP WAS INTENDED.  EQUIVALENT PROCESSORS WILL BE CO NSIDERED. ll.	We understand your desire to locate the analytics in the camera to provide greater accuracy and reduced bandwidth.  We have a few questions about these requirements.  The requirements of higher accuracy (due to analysis on uncompressed video) and lower  bandwidth consumption can be met by devices that sit next to or near the camera, as opposed to inside the camera.  Can the government explain the basis of the requirement for being inside the camera, when the functional requirements can be met by an edge device/appliance located at or near the camera?  LESS MAINTENANCE, REDUCED POSSIBILITY OF REPLACEMENTS IN FUTURE.  MOVEMENT OF PICTURE OUTSIDE OF CAMERA IS ASSUMED TO BE DONE VIA COMPRESSION OR ANALOG, LOWERING QUALITY. mm.	The amendment specifies distances at which a human and vehicle must be detected.  We assume that the requirement is that the analytics system detect and classify the object as a human (or vehicle as the case may be) at the distance specified, in the ex clusion of other objects.  In other words, the system must be able to distinguish between a human, vehicle, noise or object of non-interest.  Once the object is classified, it should be indicated by an appropriate display for the object type, such as H f or human, V for vehicle, etc.    In most cases, distinguishing objects, not just detecting, is vitally important so the system doesnt generate false alarms on non-interesting objects. CONCUR. nn.	What is meant by Detect suspicious behaviors?  Can you be more specific?  LOITERING, CLIMBING OVER FENCES, AND APPROACHING FACILITY FROM WOOD LINE. oo.	What are the specific requirements for object left behind and object placed in view?  TO ALERT THOSE MONITORING SYSTEM AND TO RECORD ACTIVITY. pp.	Are the cameras that will be used to detect those behaviors the same ones that are used for perimeter dectection?  IDEALLY. qq.	Is it desired to have near-camera analytics on these cameras.  DESIRE IS ON CAMERA. rr.	What size objects and at what distance must be detected?  I HAVE SEEN BACKPACK DETECTED AT 250 METERS, THIS IS WHAT IS DESIRED. ss.	There are potentially conflicting requirements relating to the need to operate in high winds and maintain accuracy at long distances.  The bid requires detection at distances of over a mile, requiring a pole of some height.  High wind conditions can ca use significant camera shake on such a camera, degrading the video quality.  Please address this issue, so we can dete rmine if camera stabilizers will be required.  Camera stabilization should not be required.  Though camera capabilities request capability to detect a Vehicle sized target at 2000 meters, the actual conditions are less than 900. tt.	We will need to know how many cameras are needed to properly size the storage devices.  We also need to know the desired video resolution for storage.  REQUESTING CONTRACTOR TO DETERMINE  THE NUMBER OF QUESTION, BASED ON OVERVIEW OF SITE.  SEE BELOW FO R RESOLUTION. uu.	Can the Government please explain the requirement for full time recording of all the cameras at 15 fps?  This requirement seem contradictory to the requirement for reduced bandwidth consumption mentioned.  If the network must be sized for a high bandwi dth condition (all cameras at 15 fps), then why is bandwidth conservation required at the camera?  15 FPS WAS MENTIONED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A GUIDELINE, INDUSTRY STANDARD ALLOWS FOR 30+ FPS DOWN TO 8 AND BELOW FPS.  WE REQUEST CAPABILITY AS USER TO DETERMI NE AND ADJUST THIS AS OUR SPECIFIC NEEDS CHANGE. vv.	The requirement for full bandwidth capacity also seems at odds with the need to run the analytics near the camera.  If the video must be transmitted to a central facility for recording purposes, what is the basis for the need to run the analytics near the camera?  IN ORDER TO PROCESS UNCOMPRESSED VIDEO. ww.	It the digital video for each camera must be recorded, that means that there is no reason to perform analytics at the camera, since the video will be available on a network in a computer compatible location where a computer running video analytics woul d also be located.  ANALYTICS ON CAMERA WILL GIVE THE CAMERA THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. xx.	Is the vendor required to provide workstation computers for the personnel for these locations?  YES. yy.	Please specify workstation requirements.  19 in MONITORS, MOUNTED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO MINIMIZE DESKTOP FOOTPRINT. zz.	If not, what are the specifications of those existing workstation computers?  WOULD COME AS PART OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS NEWEST INDUSTRY STANDARD. aaa.	Please provide the number of doors and gates.  ONE PEDISTRIAN GATE AND ONE VEHICLE GATE.   bbb.	The size and location of each.  ALLOW FOR SINGLE PERSON AND SINGLE VEHICLE. ccc.	Whether the gates are existing or need to be provided. EXISTING SWINGING GATE WILL HAVE TO BE REMOVED AND NEW GATE PUT IN ITS PLACE. ddd.	If power or connectivity is available or needs to be provided.  AVAILABLE. NEARBY. eee.	The distances between the gates and available power and other facilities.  25 METERS. fff.	Does the system need to be compatible with existing card access technology already in place.  NO. ggg.	Please provide distances between all devices or facilities that need to be connected with the fiber network.  PLEASE REQUEST HANDOUT FROM stephanie.murphree@conus.army.mil.  WE ARE HOPING THIS WILL SATISFY THIS QUESTION. hhh.	Please provide detailed plans/drawings for area around the motor pool office and the HQ Staff Duty.  THESE ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE.  YOU MAY BE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS. iii.	Do the cameras mentioned above need to be connected to the fiber optic network?  YES jjj.	Is this true for all cameras? YES. (iv)	Submission of quotes shall be forwarded by Wednesday, September 12, 2007, 1:00 local time using either facsimile at (910) 396-7872, or email at stephanie.murphree@conus.army.mil.
