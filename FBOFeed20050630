<DESC>Title:  Improving Follow-Up to Newborn Hearing Screening by Working  Through The Medical Home.
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intend to negotiate on a sole sources basis with the National Initiative for Children Healthcare Quality, 20 University Road, 7th Floor, and Cambridge, MA   02138.  The National Initiative for Children Healthcare Quality shall use a quality improvement process to enhance the capacity of State Title V Programs and health delivery organizations to better meet the needs of infants suspected or known to have a hearing loss by improving follow up to newborn hearing screening by working with the Medical Home. The NAICS Code is s 541618.  Approximately four million infants are screened each year for a variety of genetic and metabolic disorders that have the potential to affect their health and development .  Early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of these disorders can ameliorate serious illness, disability, even death.  For example, three out of every 1,000 infants are born with significant hearing loss.  Recent efforts towards universal newborn hearing screening before hospital discharge have led to a substantial reduction in the age at which children with congenital permanent hearing loss are diagnosed. Clear evidence links this early identification and intensive early intervention with significant improvements in school-related measures such as reading, vocabulary, social adjustment and behavior compared to children who did not receive this early intervention. Despite clear evidence of improved physical and developmental outcomes, significant gaps remain, particularly in the areas of appropriate and timely diagnosis and intervention.  In some states, only 1 in 5 children provided a referral to a sub specialist ever receive a confirmed diagnosis.  Furthermore, the quality and consistency of linkages between initial screening, diagnosis, and intervention are variable.  Hospital records frequently do not correctly identify the medical home for the infant; the medical home is not always supportive of the need for rapid follow-up testing for infants who do not pass pre-discharge hearing screening.  Publicly funded infant and child health programs such as prenatal screening; Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; high-risk infant follow up; and early intervention programs often operate independently of one another.  The resulting duplication can lead to increased burdens on families and health professionals and higher costs. Improved coordination and integration will require collaboration among public health professionals, primary care providers, specialists, early intervention program leaders, and families.   This contract will be conducted through two concurrent and interwoven components:  first, strengthening State (Title V) capacity to support implementation and spread of the Medical Home; and second leading a Medical Home collaborative for primary care practices.  Since 1994, the Center for Medical Home Improvement (CMHI) has helped to establish and support networks of parent/professional teams that work to improve the quality of primary care through medical homes for children and youth with special health care needs and their families.  The CMHI has developed and validated a self-assessment and classification tool at their own expense designed to translate the broad indicators defining the medical home (accessible, family-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, etc.) into observable, tangible behaviors and processes of care within any office setting. It is a way of measuring and quantifying the “medical homeness" of a primary care practice. The Medial Home Index (MHI) is based on the premise that "medical home" is an evolutionary process rather than a fully realized status for most practice settings. The MHI measures a practice's progress in this process.  Due to their extensive involvement in the development and validation of the required tool, the Center for Medical Home Improvement has the following unique qualifications: (1) The development and extensive use of  the medical home index with practices and families, over the past 10yrs (2) Databases of individual practices who have successfully utilized the Medical Home Index (3) Copyrights to the medical home index, both the provider and family indices and (4) Expertise to evaluate the impact of  having a medical home on utilization and satisfaction outcomes utilizing the MHI.  These unique qualifications enable the vendor to efficiently and effectively evaluate the medical home index. No other vendor can meet this requirement of such limited duration without substantial duplication of effort. The National Initiative For Children’s Healthcare Quality is the only organization that provides these services. .  Any other organization that attempts to retrieve this type of privileged information would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.    This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition, therefore, the National Initiative for Children’s Healthcare Quality , is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 (c), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is on file.  Special Notice # 22

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Tekran Inc., to purchase three (Mercury/Hg) Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS).

Based on the EPA’s knowledge of the CEMS , there are features covered in the specifications that may have unique capabilities to particular vendors.  Specifically, each Hg CEMS must: 

	- be capable of performing automated, total Hg and speciated Hg measurements from a variety of combustion processes at pollution control inlet and outlet locations
	- be capable of periodic, user defined, automated quality assurance/quality control checks that assess zero/span instrument drift and system bias;  using self-contained, automated Hg0 and HgCl2 gaseous standard calibration/calibration check source(s).
	- be capable of periodic, user defined, and automated dynamic probe spiking of Hg using self-contained, automated Hg0 and HgCl2 gaseous standard calibration/calibration check source(s).
	- be equipped with inertial probe sample interface systems for sampling in high PM environments
	- inertial probe/Hg CEMS must be capable of measuring the sample flow rate.  If a venturi is used for flow sensing, the absolute inlet pressure, pressure differential, and gas temperature must all be measured continuously and used to accurately calculate the volumetric flow rates.
	- inertial probe/Hg CEMS must be capable of maintaining sample flow at constant flow rates ranging from 5-50 lpm (± 0.5 lpm)
	- inertial probe/Hg CEMS must be capable of measuring and monitoring sample flow rate accurately and precisely (±3% of sample flow)
	-   inertial probe/Hg CEMS must be capable of automatically introducing Hg0 and/or HgCl2 calibration gases at multiple concentrations at several probe locations including as a minimum the probe tip and downstream of the inertial filter
	-   inertial probe/Hg CEMS must allow manual introduction of audit Hg0 and HgCl2 calibration gases at multiple probe locations including as a minimum the probe tip, immediately upstream of the inertial filter, and downstream of the inertial filter. 
	- the Hg0 and HgCl2 gas standards must be capable of delivering gaseous concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 250 µg/m3 at flow rates ranging from &#8804;2 lpm to &#8805;30 lpm
	- be equipped with heated (360F), 50ft, PFA sample lines
	- utilize the atomic fluorescence detection principle
	- utilize gold preconcentration to eliminate quenching of fluorescence caused by molecular species
	- be able to quantify Hg emissions levels less than 0.1 ug/m3.
	- have a computer-based process control for system automation and control, including data acquisition and data reduction/reporting software
	- have remote control facilities to allow remote access, troubleshooting and control of all analyzer functions
	- be able to control and automate measurement frequency from each sampling location, including independent control of the frequency of total and speciated Hg measurements
	- have demonstrated ability to operate unattended for extended periods.  References for multiple installations required.
 	- have demonstrated ability to operate reliably in high particulate loading environments 

Delivery Schedule:  The equipment shall be delivered no later than 2 months after issuance or purchase order

Warranty Requirements:  Standard warranty clause for acquiring equipment using simplified acquisition procedures is acceptable.

Installation Requirements:  The Contractor shall provide all labor resources necessary to install and demonstrate performance at EPA’s Multi Pollutant Combustion Research Facility, Durham, NC 27709.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation No. DTRS57-05-Q-80144 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.  The NAICS Code is 488190 and the Small Business size standard is $6.0M. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION, COMPETITIVE QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND AN ADDITOINAL WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Proposals shall include pricing for the following  contract line items (CLINS): CLIN 0001, Mobile all terrain Telescoping 100ft tower with trailer, 1 EA $____; CLIN 0002, Tower wind Load Stress Review Engineering Analysis $____.  The Statement of Work is as follows: Background: The Volpe National Transportation Systems (Volpe Center) supports the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) Joint Wake Turbulence and Wake Studies Program.  Wake turbulence is a major contributor to terminal delays, especially when visual operations are not permitted.  Wake turbulence reduces terminal capacity during reduced visibility conditions in a number of ways: (1) Increases the in-trail separation between aircraft and (2) Restricts the use of closely spaced parallel runways (CSPRs) to an equivalent sin gle runway operation.  A variety of procedures and technologies appear to be promising at regaining some of this lost capacity, and are being pursued by the FAA, NASA and the Volpe Center. The behavior of wake vortices is affected by atmospheric turbulence.  Of the various ways to characterize atmospheric turbulence for wake vortex studies, the most reliable technique is use of an instrumented tower.  The Volpe Center is initiating the purchase of a tower suitable for collecting the necessary meteorological data to support an investigation of wake vortex behavior at Denver International Airport.  Description of Supplies/Services - Since many of Volpe Center's wake vortex investigations are in an operational airport environment, the tower shall have the following requirements:  1. The tower  shall be mobile and all terrain meeting ANSI/TIA/EIA 222-F (Exposure “C”). A heavy-duty all-terrain trailer shall be included that is designed to carry the tower, its standard equipment and accessories, and the Volpe center’s supplied equipment. It shall meet or exceed the applicable United Stated Federal Vehicle Safety Standard and Regulations. Full size spare tire designed for the heavy-duty all-terrain trailer shall be provided. 2.  The supporting trailer shall have a minimum safety factor of 2 with 4 in critical load areas. 3.  The tower shall be secure (since the tower is to support weather data collection and will have sensors mounted on it, it shall have the structural rigidity needed to ensure data quality is not compromised by tower movement). 4.  Complete tower lock, redundant c abling, heavy-duty telescopic outrigger stabilizing system, and all weather wiring and LED lighting packages shall be provided.  5.  The tower shall be able to withstand wind loads typical of the airport operational conditions.  The tower needs to be able to sustain 40 knots winds. 6.  The tower shall be self-supporting. Also, the tower shall have the capability for further stabilization with the use of multi-level guy cables and ground anchor system.  7. The tower needs to be able to hold up to the weight of 3 high-speed sonic anemometers, 3 three-axes propeller anemometers, a warning light as well as associated cables.   (The estimated sensor load is approximately 300 lbs).  The tower shall tilt and telescope with the minimum lift capacity of 450 lbs.  The tower top plate and mount shall  be designed according to the Volpe Center’s requirements.  8.  The tower shall be a telescoping type to allow the flexibility of deploying it at an airport location while satisfying the obstruction rule.  A min. height shall be 45-50 ft. and the maximum height shall be in the 100-110 ft. range.  9.  The tower shall be a lightweight truss type (instead of a mast type) to provide minimum influence from the interaction between tower structure and wind fields on the data. 10. The tower shall have the capability of adding an all weather rated powered cranking mechanism in addition to the manual scheme to allow lowering of the tower. The power supply shall be of 110V/20A/60Hz requirement.  11. The tower shall have lightening protection. Grounding kits include: aerial, copper, ground bar and con nectors.  12.  The tower shall have tower top aviation obstruction light with UV protected cable.  13.  Hard and soft copies of the training, operating and maintenance manual shall be provided.  14.  Tower controls shall be protected with an exterior access locking box enclosure. A deck mounted storage box shall be provided.  Structural Safety Engineering Analysis - An independent stress analysis and grounding counterpoise system analysis review by an independent licensed professional engineer shall be performed to determine the appropriateness of the self-supporting tower in conformance to the all-terrain ANSI/TIA/EIA 222-F (Exposure “C”) requirements for a Volpe Center’s specific load configuration and wind loading. .A written report showing the maximum tower analysis results of each of  loading requirement and a PASS/FAIL notice for the Tower configuration shall be done. If a FAIL condition occurs, the vendor shall supply, without additional cost to the government, an appropriate mobile, telescoping, self-supporting Tower substitute. An independent professional engineer shall do the re-analysis of the Tower. The Engineer shall perform a stress analysis and grounding counterpoise system analysis review to confirm the structural integrity and appropriateness of the Tower substitute, according to Volpe Center’s minimum load requirements cited above, at no additional cost to the government.  Solicitation provision FAR 52.212-1, Instruction of Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2005) is hereby incorporated by reference; the offer must include a copy of the standard commercial warr anty per FAR Clause 52.212-1(b)(5), Terms of any Express Warranty.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) with a Specification for the development and production of Self Contained (SC) light emitting diode (LED), buoy lanterns.  These omni-directional lanterns using light emitting diodes (LED) will be evaluated to determine their potential use as replacements for existing signaling hardware.  The lanterns will be used on aids to navigation in the coastal waters of the United States.  The family of self-contained LED lanterns will include lanterns that produce either a red or green light using LEDs as a light source, and lanterns with different solar power systems.  It is anticipated that the buoy lanterns will consist of one or more rings of LEDs, electronic power/timer circuitry, solar power generation and energy storage devices (i.e. solar panels and batteries), and a housing which incorporates the necessary light lensing.  A DRAFT COPY of the Specification 502 Change 1 Self-Contained, Light Emitting Diode (LED) Buoy Lantern can be found at: http://www.uscg.mil/systems/gse/gse2/Specifications.htm.  This is a DRAFT COPY of the specification and is to be used for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  It should not be used for any other purpose or construed as an official FINAL Specification.  The final specification will be included in the solicitation.  The USCG intends to make multiple awards and each award shall be for procurement of no less than 30 red and 30 green production lanterns.  Larger quantities may be ordered depending on the unit price and the actual number of awards made.  The awards will be Firm-Fixed price contracts.  First Article quantities will be required to conform to all contract requirements for acceptance.  This is an unrestricted (full and open) procurement.  The NAICS code is 335129 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The USCG anticipates posting the RFP on the Federal Business Opportunities Website within the month of July.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB) plans to procure an FEI Nova 200 Nanolab UHR FEG-SEM/FIB microscope and Dual Beam software on a sole source basis with FEI CO., 5350 N.E. Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, Oregon 97124. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The Nova 200 Nanolab and dual beam system will provide a powerful tool for automated, site-specific tissue imaging at resolutions necessary to visualize the subcellular architecture of cells and cell-cell contacts.  The availability of this instrument will significantly enhance the potential of the other governmentowned FEI electron microscopes already present at NCI for; (i) visualization of the architecture of normal vs. tumor cells, (ii) generation of tissue sections at room temperature and cryogenic temperatures using electronic rather than manual sectioning and (iii) three-dimensional visualization of cells and tissues at resolutions about ten times better than optical microscopy.  Very few high resolution electron based imaging facilities exist in the world and NCI offers the environment necessary to support such an effort, including expertise in structural and cell biology, cancer research, nanoscience, computational and systems biology.  The following unique specifications are required for  in order to meet the NCI requirements:  1) Hybrid instrument with two energetic beam systems [focused ion beam (FIB) and Schottky type field emission electron beam (FEG SEM)] integrated into one tool; 2) The FEG SEM must be a UHF immersion lens type FEG and an ion column with both low and high current milling; 3) The system must also have proven experience with interfacing with other sample enhancing and sample data generation devices such as sample freezing, x-ray analysis, crystallography, and in-situ gas chemistries; 4) System must be able to provide automation software that allows the user to preprogram milling routines, preposition and deliver operator selected gases, milling and imaging, milling/imaging/x-ray analysis, and milling/imaging/crystallography and; 5) The system must be capable of being fully integrated with a cryotransfer system for operation at specimen temperatures as low as –160 C.  FEI, Co., is the only source known to the NCI that is the sole manufacturer of the Nova200 Nanolab microscope and dual beam software that can meet these specifications and perform the analyses that NCI needs to carry out.  The Nova 200 Nanolab instrument is also unique because of its compatibility with electron microscopes already installed at NCI.  The FEI Nova 200 Nanolab UHR FEG-SEM/FIB microscope holds several U.S. Patents:  Gas injector needle mechanics, Patent number 5,435,850; H2O injection, Selective Carbon Mill (SCM) U. S. Patents 5,958,799 & 6,140,655; Delineation etch U.S. Patent 6,268,608; Selective Metal Etch (Iodine) U.S. Patent 5,188,705; CoppeRx U.S. Patent 6322672. These parts and accessories are vital components that make up the Nova 200 Nanolab.  Without them, the microscope will not be useful for our proposed research. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST, on July 11, 2005.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, via fax at 301-402-4513 or via electronic mail holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please reference NCI-50077-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Video Extensometer. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Instron Corporation, Norwood, MA, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for acquisition of supplies or servcies when the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	Instron Corporation developed MSFC’s tensile test machines with which the video extensometer will interface as well as the operating application software currently being used on these test machines.  The items requested are required to provide enhanced measurement capability for use with the existing Instron tensile test machines currently in use in the Materials and Processes Lab. The hardware and software interfaces are proprietary to Instron and thus any design specifications cannot be released to other companies. 2.	The proposed subsystem must be compatible with the existing operating software and hardware, extend the system capability to perform the elongation measurement in various configurations, and be compatible for use with existing Instron systems already in use at this location.  Market research reveals that Instron is the only source that can meet these requirements. If a similar type system were to be acquired from another vendor, a significant amount of software interface development, integration and verification time would be incurred, as well as operational downtime that would impact test schedules  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 11, 2005.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation to procure the services of a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program (Ticket Program) Operations Support Manager (OSM) contractor to meet the objectives set forth in the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (TWWIIA), Public Law 106-170 and in the Social Security Act, Section 1148.  Specifically, the Ticket Program OSM will oversee and support processes necessary to sustain ongoing Ticket Program operations and facilitate access of Ticket-eligible beneficiaries to Employment Networks (EN) by:  (1) establishing and maintaining a toll-free telephone call center and electronic mail response capability to answer beneficiary questions and making referrals, as appropriate (2) administering and supporting the Ticket assignment process; and (3) administering and supporting the EN payment process.

On Sep 29, 2000, SSA awarded a 5-year contract to a single Program Manager (PM) to assist in administering the Ticket Program by providing a wide variety of services in 3 main areas: EN recruitment, operations support, and systems access and support.  To meet Ticket Program support requirements following expiration of the current PM contract on Sep 28, 2005, SSA will award 2 Ticket Program contracts:  OSM and Program Manager for Recruitment and Outreach (PMRO).  SSA anticipates contract award on Aug 1, 2005.  The OSM contractor must be fully operational and be prepared to assume all the duties and responsibilities required by this solicitation by Sep 29, 2005.  (NOTE:  SSA will provide the necessary system access and support directly and/or through a systems support contractor.)  The services to be procured affiliated with this Presolicitation Notice and anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) Number SSA-RFP-05-1047 are for the services of a Ticket Program OSM.  Anticipated services to be procured for the Ticket Program PMRO are affiliated with RFP Number SSA-RFP-06-1006.  

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  On Dec 17, 1999, the President signed the TWWIIA establishing the Ticket Program (see http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10061.html for additional information).  This legislation establishes in the SSA the Ticket Program to provide Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities more choices for receiving employment services and increases provider incentives to serve beneficiaries with disabilities who want to work.  Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits are designed to provide a basic level of support for individuals with disabilities whose earning abilities are restricted due to their impairments.  TWWIIA Public Law 106-170 addresses a number of barriers that advocates believe disability beneficiaries encounter in obtaining jobs and continuing to work by expanding the availability of health care services and coverage, eliminating certain work disincentives, providing for enhanced benefits planning and assistance from other public and private sources and creating the Ticket Program. 

Under the Ticket program, SSA is directed to provide disability beneficiaries with a Ticket they may use to obtain Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services, employment services, and/or other support services from an EN of their choice and to establish agreements with ENs to provide such services.  The Ticket Program was implemented nationally in 3 phases beginning Feb 2002 through Sep 2004 and Tickets were mailed to more than 10 million eligible beneficiaries with disabilities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.  In addition, Tickets are mailed to between 80,000 and 85,000 new beneficiaries each month upon entering the disability rolls. 

SSA anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursement type contract with a 5-year period of performance.  The estimated date for the issuance of the RFP on www.fedbizopps.com  is Jun 3, 2005 with proposal responses due 30 calendar days thereafter (est. Jul 3, 2005).  The solicitation and any amendments will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov for all interested parties.  Paper copies of the RFP and affiliate documents will not be mailed.  No telephone requests will be honored. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

We anticipate that may take another two weeks.  In  the interim, we plan to post an updated draft in the next few days to pass on  the incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. As you are aware, we have been on a very aggressive schedule.  The delays we  are experiencing put our contract award schedule at risk.  We are requesting  your cooperation in helping us make up some schedule time by reducing the  number of days required for proposal preparation.  If you plan to bid this  program, request you provide the PCO feedback on the acceptability of reducing  the number of days for proposal submission from 45 days to a lesser number,  and identify the minimum time you believe is required.  Request your response  by 1 April 2005.  When a go-ahead is received from SAF/AQ and OSD, the AEASS  will determine the proposal due date and adjust the expected contract award  date accordingly.  UPDATE 22 March 2005:  A new attachment with the title of Questions and  Answers has been added to the document library below. UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.  Offerors are requested  to notify the PCO when the Past Performance volume is anticipated to be  submitted. UPDATE 9 March 2005 (Second update for this date):  RFP release is delayed  pending completion of the Government+s review/approval process.  Tentative  date for release is now 25 March 2005, in which case proposals will be due by  10 May 2005. However, the Past Performance Volume will be due by 15 Apr 2005.   The Government still plans to award the contract by the end of July 2005. Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors is modified by  making the following change to Table 3.1 Proposal Organization in Paragraph  3.1.5.2, Organization, Number of Copies, and Page Limits.  The maximum page  limit for Vol III, Past Performance, is now 60 pages.  Within those 60 pages,  there should be no more than 5 pages per each past contract.

It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<SOLNBR>W909MY-05-R-0007
<RESPDATE>080905
<ARCHDATE>10082005
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>It is the intent of the CECOM Acquisition Center Washington to issue a competitive Request for Proposal for the 60,000 BTU/HR Improved Environmental Control Unit (60K IECU) program.  The 60K IECU program is a joint Army and Air Force effort to replac e heavy and inefficient field environmental control units that utilize ozone-depleting refrigerants.  The proposed full and open competitive acquisition will result in a single contract award.  The single acquisition will be executed in three phases:  1) a n 18-month Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, 2) a 6-month Firm-Fixed-Price option for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Phase, and 3) 5 one-year Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity options for the Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase.  During the SDD phase, the selected contractor will be required to design and fabricate 8 prototype 60K IECUs to support Production Qualification Testing, Logistics Demonstration and a field user evaluation . If the LRIP option is exercised, the contractor will be required to deliver 60 LRIP units for First Article Testing.  If exercised, the FRP phase will occur over a 5 one year periods and it is anticipated that a maximum of 5,747 IECUs will be acquired du ring this phase.  The 60K IECU will be a replacement for the existing Army 54,000-Btu/hr ECU and the Air Force developed 66,000-Btu/hr Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU).  The 60K IECU will be much lighter in weight than these existing mil itary standard ECUs which are currently used to provide environmental control capability to Force Provider, Deployable Medical Systems, Tactical Operations Centers, and other joint services including the Air Force.  The need for the lightweight 60K IECU is  shared by all services especially the Army and Air Force who are striving to reduce the logistics footprint and increase system deployability.  Present and emerging command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissanc e (C4ISR) systems require environmental control to moderate the environmental temperatures in which these systems operate.  The key performance driver and constraint for military systems today and in the future is system weight.  Additionally, the primary shortcoming is that refrigerants for existing military standard (MIL-STD) ECUs use ozone depleting hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), namely HCFC-22.   This ozone depleting chemical has been regulated according to a specific schedule that prohibits its manu facture after 1 January 2010, and bans its use altogether by 1 January 2020 for servicing of existing equipment.  These phase-out dates occur much earlier in some allied nations where the U.S. Army must continue to operate.  Additionally, existing MIL-STD ECUs are becoming increasingly unreliable due to lifecycle expiration and/or are no longer supportable by Army logistics and training systems.  MIL-STD ECUs and their associated components were designed to operate with ozone depleting refrigerants and cann ot be economically modified to accept environmentally friendly alternatives.  These ECUs in all sizes and configurations will not meet stated domestic legal requirements or international agreements and shall be used until no longer repairable and then repl aced with the Family of IECUs.  A recent revalidation to the IECU ORD was approved that identified new requirements for 60K Btu/hr and 120K Btu/hr capacity IECU systems. Performance parameters set forth in the ORD include reduced power consumption, reduced  weight/logistics footprint, increased reliability, compatible with current military shelter systems as 'drop-in' replacement for MIL-SD ECUs including FDECU, elimination of ozone depleting refrigerants and designed to field and sustainment level maintenan ce.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil on or about 5 July  20 05.  No hard copies or copies via email will be available.  Responses shall also be submitted via the IBOP.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to identify sources that can provide an adaptive optics (AO) subsystem for use in free space optical communications.  The Optics Division (AFRL/DES) has engaged in research and development to achieve a higher technical maturity level for curvature based wavefront sensing adaptive optic (AO) systems. The objectives of this effort are to develop, fabricate, and demonstrate an adaptive optics (AO) subsystem for use in free space optical communications. This AO subsystem would provide a significant improvement in laser communications link availability between ground-to-ground terminals; ground-to-and from-airborne mobile terminals; and eventually between airborne mobile terminals. Previous efforts had the specific goal of increasing system bandwidths to greater than 6Khz with a technical path for increasing system bandwidths to 10Khz. The goal of this current effort will be to produce a system capable of achieving system bandwidths exceeding 10Khz.  Respondents must have previously demonstrated Adaptive Optics system performance at closed loop bandwidths exceeding 2.5khz, and have demonstrated such adaptive optics systems in integrated bi-directional FSO links.

Respondents are required to provide a statement of capability containing pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas: 1. Experience: An outline of projects previously performed relevant to the subject areas. 2. Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in the areas of subject effort. 3. Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration. Responses are limited to 15 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Any responses not addressing all requirements will be rejected. Submit responses to Linda Buix, AFRL/PKDL, 2251 Maxwell Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773 no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of this announcement by 3:00 p.m., Mountain Daylight Time (MDT). This is an unrestricted announcement under NAICS code 541710. However, firms should indicate whether they are or not a small business, woman-owned, qualifying 8(a) businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, or historically black colleges, universities, and minority institutions (HBCU/MI). In order to receive a DoD contract, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program. For more information and on-line registration with CCR, see http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil. It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws. Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers. Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave., North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/CCAL/ for further information on certification and the approval process. The offeror is required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with its proposal or to the Contracting Officer if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal.

<CONTACT>BETTY L HEWITT PURCHASING AGENT 3032369316     blnelson@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including telephone number for a point of contact) to the procurement office above within 15 days from the data of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, CICT Team, Denver, CO has a requirement for three portable magnetometers. Because of challenges inherent to conducting a large-scale magnetic survey in Afghanistan, base magnetometers must be able to operate remotely for several weeks at a time. Therefore they must meet the following specifications: Extremely Low Power Consumption:  The magnetometer must be capable of collecting field readings (sensor polarization and data storage) in a slow-cycling rate with a power consumption of approximately lOOmA. This specification is necessary in order to ensure that the system will be able to continuously operate (remotely) for several weeks, powered only by a small photovoltaic and power storage system. Integrated GPS ti/ne-stamp:  In order to provide diurnal correction for aerial magnetic data the magnetometer must stamp field readings with extremely accurate time. Although many magnetometers accommodate an external GPS time/location stamp, they commonly revert back to a battery-powered clock (non-GPS) for time if the system restarts due to a power shortage. The magnetometer must be able to reconfigure to GPS time upon restart. An integrated GPS satisfies this requirement. Memory:  Due to the remote location of the magnetometers they may only be downloaded periodically. Therefore, the magnetometer must be capable of storing field-readings for up to 30 days. At the desired sampling rate this would require storage of several hundred thousand data points in internal memory. A minimum of 4 MB internal memory would be required. Programmable:  The magnetometers will be operating in remote settings with a limited power supply. A programmable schedule will allow the magnetometer to start up and shut down independently. This specification will save power and limit the collection of unnecessary data. Remote Control:  Due to the difficulties and security risks associated with transportation in Afghanistan, the magnetometers must be able to operate under remote control. The magnetometer must be able to accommodate external control of cycling, scheduling, and data transfer. The government considers the producr specified as a sole source from Gem Systems, Inc.and plans to negotiate a purchase order with this firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation documents exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five offerors, design-build firms or teams, based on design-build factors.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.

The work will also include demo of the interior of the existing vault including asbestos abatement and disposal of existing equipment.  The airfield will remain in operation during construction, which will require extensive coordination with airfield operations personnel. The Contractor will be required to complete work quickly, often during nights and weekends, shifting construction work location from one area to another to accommodate airfield operations. The Contractor will be required to leave major systems in operation at the end of every workday.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $4,383,000 and $5,357,000.

Reference to these services is not meant to be all-inclusive, but only meant to convey a reasonable idea of the types of services that will be included in the proposed public-private A-76 competition.  The Government is considering a firm-fixed price contract type with some Indefinite Delivery – Indefinite Quantity contract line items.  A previous version of the draft solicitation (Draft TIRNO-05-R-00001) was released on December 16, 2004.  The Performance Work Statement (PWS) has been revised and the updated document has been posted to the IRS Procurement website:  http://www.irs.gov/opportunities/procurement/index.html. The IRS has prepared a Request for Proposals (RFP) and release of the final RFP is eminent.  A separate notice to formally announce this acquisition will be issued in the FedBizOpps.  The objective of this sources sought announcement is to provide advance notice of the changes to the PWS from the previous draft RFP, to solicit comments from interested parties regarding site visits for the proposed solicitation, and to obtain additional technical capability statements from interested parties capable of performing the above referenced functions by providing information on key staff experience, a description of corporate experience and a description of primary services provided to either the government or commercial customers, as well as the NAICS code(s) for the supplies/services.  Specifically describe your firm’s ability to meet the scope of the requirement, managing peak workload volumes, special handling and management of secure documents, experience in inventory management (e.g., tracking, logging, and reporting), and other related logistic support services.  With regards to comments pertaining to the site visits, please provide this office with your comments regarding the number of sites visits that will best facilitate the development of a response to the proposed requirement as well as any other related concerns regarding this matter (e.g., locations).  Further, all interested parties are hereby invited to submit a technical capability statement of no more than fifteen pages to illustrate technical capabilities.  In addition to information provided by your technical capability statements, provide a total of five present and past performance references of similar contracts that have been completed in the past five years.

<SUBJECT>D -- Federal Asset Sales - Personal Property E-gov initiative
<DESC>PERSONAL PROPERTY - Request for Proposal FAS-PP-03-004, Posted on August 25, 2003, is hereby Canceled, and No Further Action will be Taken With Respect to this Solicitation.   After careful review, GSA has determined that FAS-PP-03-0004 no longer accurately reflects the government’s requirements. GSA presently is undertaking a review of its acquisition strategy for this procurement and has determined that a restructure of the procurement will be more advantageous to industry and federal agencies.  GSA is working closely with OMB and other federal agencies to develop a new acquisition approach.  In addition, there has been a substantial amount of time which has elapsed since the initial issuance of the solicitation on August 25, 2003.  Because of potential changes to GSA's requirements, there is a possibility that additional firms may be interested in participating in this competition based acquisition.  Any future effort will be published in FBO, as appropriate.  No additional information is available at this time.

<SUBJECT>A--NASA RFI: EARTH SCIENCES ADVANCED MISSIONS PLATFORM RESEARCH AIRCRAFT
<DESC>NASA/DFRC anticipates a requirement to use a high altitude, long endurance manned aircraft as an Advanced Missions Platform (AMP) to carry earth science sensor payloads to areas world-wide by the fourth quarter of FY 2008.  The payloads themselves would be designed to automatically determine optimum flight trajectories based on sensor measurements and pass this information to the aircraft’s flight control system, essentially re-directing the aircraft in response to the earth science data.  NASA is interested in information on vehicles with capabilities substantially similar to those listed below that may be able to perform this mission.	Once proven aboard this vehicle, these “intelligent payloads” may later be transitioned to other manned aircraft or UAVs.  Such other aircraft and the sensor payloads themselves are not the subject of this RFI. Description of Information Requested:  NASA/DFRC is hereby requesting information regarding potential sources and partners for the acquisition, modification, and flight testing of a manned environmental sciences platform which can fly at altitudes above 60,000 feet with large science payloads exceeding 1000 kg total, including single items up to 750 kg plus various distributed components comprising the remainder. The optimum vehicle will be configurable to carry a variety of payloads of various weights and with a variety of power requirements up to 10Kw for periods of up to 16 hours over ranges in excess of 6000 nm.  The vehicle should be adaptable to modifications to carry one or more instrument pods externally (with provisions for pod temperature control and/or pressurization) or should be able to provide provisions within the cabin for various sensors to take in-situ air samples and/or view atmospheric phenomena above, as well as observe atmospheric or surface phenomena below.  The vehicle will be required to operate in controlled and uncontrolled airspace worldwide through various weather conditions from tropical to arctic. The vehicle will have to operate over population centers as well as over the open ocean at distances up to 1200 nm from shore.  The optimum vehicle will already be fitted with a digital flight management system and/or digital autopilot.  Regardless of FMS or autopilot type, the system must interface readily with a GFE “outer loop” research flight control computer that will provide automated flight path guidance generated by the environmental sensor payloads being carried.  The contractor-provided FMS or autopilot must have internal authority limits that will prevent exceeding any aircraft limitations.  The aircraft will be capable of extended loiter near a particular longitude and latitude and of following specific weather phenomena over very large areas such as the Pacific Ocean.	Ability to provide accommodations for up to two researchers or relief aircrew as part of the payload would be a plus, but is not a requirement.	If space for researchers is not available, provisions for payload control from a crew station will be required.  Ability to transit areas of moderate icing en-route to areas of scientific interest would also be advantageous. In the course of acquiring and modifying the aircraft designed to meet these objectives NASA and its industrial partner(s) will review, clarify and possibly modify the proposed requirements. The partnership will jointly: develop the design(s) and on-board research systems to meet the requirements, model design performance under operational conditions, design and execute plans for interfacing the required research systems with aircraft indigenous systems, install them on the vehicle, then plan and execute flight testing of the research systems and environmental sensors. NASA is open to a number of procurement approaches to any eventual acquisition and will consider non-traditional business arrangements.  There is no specific requirement for NASA to own or operate the vehicle, so in one approach, the airframe provider might own and operate the vehicle and be assured regular systems engineering and integration work incorporating various environmental sensor packages as well as purchase by NASA of sufficient flight hours to enable a valid long-term business relationship.   SUBMISSIONS:  Interested parties able to partner with NASA to outfit an aircraft that can meet the performance objectives above (or other capabilities that are substantially similar) should submit a capability statement of 5 pages or less indicating the ability to perform the effort described herein.  Responders are also encouraged to comment on alternative acquisition approaches that do not involve outright purchase of the airframe by NASA.  PLEASE DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the CBD and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors’ responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Additional Key Words to Support Electronic Search: Air Transport		Aircraft Lease		Stratosphere		Remote Sensing NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL PROCUREMENT AND THEREFORE IS NOT A SOLICITATION. THIS NOTICE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ULTIMATELY ISSUE AN IFB, RFP, RFQ, OR CONTRACT.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure the analysis of 1000 urine samples for two PAH metabolites (1-OHP, 2-naphthol) and two oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG, MDA). The services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance FAR 12  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541380, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

BACKGROUND:  PAHs have shown to cause mammary cancer in experimental animals. Some epidemiological studies have shown significant associations between breast cancer and occupational exposure to PAHs, active and passive smoking, and consumption of well-done meats which contains high levels of PAHs.  Although these are potentially important exposures for breast cancer, the evidence is not clear.  Exposure assessment for epidemiologic studies is based on information from interviews.  Measurements of urinary PAH metabolites in subjects with PAHs exposure in an epidemiological study would reduce misclassification of exposure and provide information on total PAH exposure.  Simultaneous measurements of 1-OHP and 2-naphthol would, therefore, provide better understanding of the total, as well as route-specific, PAH exposure and help clarify the relation of these chemicals with the risk of breast cancer.  There is growing interest in the role of oxidative stress from chemicals like these and breast cancer development because of cross-talk between oxidative stress and hormonal imbalance.  There are, however, a limited number of population-based studies of oxidative stress and breast cancer.  Among several biomarkers of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondiadelyde (MDA) are most frequently used because of their biological importance and the sensitivity of the assay.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall perform the following tasks on 1000 urine samples sent all at one time:  1) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 1-OHP;  2) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 2-naphthol;  3) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 8-OHdG; 4) Analyze 1000 urine samples for MDA; and 5) Provide results of the analyses in an Excel spreadsheet to the Project Officer containing sample ID, test-date, test results and if applicable, quality control data. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITES:  NCI will ship the 1000 urine samples on dry ice. Samples will be coded and will not have any personal identifiers attached.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Offers will be evaluated based on the following technical criteria.  The technical portion 	of the proposal will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  1)  Technical Approach – 50% proposed methods for measurements of urinary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and biomarkers of oxidative stress must be sound and fully described. The proposed approach must be consistent with the stated goals and objectives of the Statement of Work i.e., measurements for 2 biomarkers of PAH metabolites and 2 biomarkers of oxidative stress.  2)  Experience  - 40% the proposed staff must have experience in conducting analyses described in the Statement of Work, including similar efforts,  Measurements of urinary metabolites of PAHs and oxidative stress for groups of Chinese women and children is a plus.   3)	Understanding of the problem – 10% must demonstrate that the proposed approach, including appropriateness of allocation and effort of proposed personnel and allocation of resources, is sufficient to accomplish the tasks in the Statement of Work. Adequate plans for quality control and timely delivery of products must be provided.  4)  Costs –is a consideration but not scored.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.
