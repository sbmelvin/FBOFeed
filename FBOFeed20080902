<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement to increase the total Estimated Contract Value of theIndefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) portion of the Facilities MaintenanceServices contract. A modification reflecting this increase will be issued for theremaining period of performance which ends September 30, 2009. NASA/ARC intends to increase the IDIQ portion of the Facilities Maintenance Servicescontract, NNA04CB37C, which was awarded through full and open competition to JohnsonControls World Services, Inc. (now IAP Worlds Services) in July of 2004. This increase isrequired due to unexpected increases in the IDIQ portion of the contract which includesrepairs/improvements to the Moffett Federal Airfield runway, repair of electrical faultoccurances at ARCs primary substation and the Unitary Wind Tunnels substation causingextensive damage to the high voltage equipment. Also unexpected was the requirement forfire alarm and elevator systems safety improvements as well as other repairs, alterationsand safety projects throughout the ARC facilities. NASA is using the authority of "OtherThan Full and Open Competition", 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification is based on IAPsunique expertise and critical involvement with the current on-going projects togetherwith their ability to provide continuity of service while the follow-on contract is beingrecompeted. Award to another source concurrent with the existing contract re-competitionwould result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected tobe recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling theagency's requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon September 12, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST bein writing and should be directed to Ms. Drake not later than 4:30 p.m. local time onSeptember 12, 2008.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for assistance and technical services to aid in theintegration of new requirements for the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System(SERVIR), the progression of SERVIR from installation to operations in East Africa andpotential expansion to other geographic regions.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Science Systems and Applications,Inc.(SSAI).  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:The funds specifically dedicated to establish and expand the SERVIR system in Africa andother geographic regions, were provided to NASA from the United States Agency forInternational Development (USAID) under a Participating Agency Program Agreement. Therequirements and timeframe which have been levied on NASA by USAID necessitate immediateimplementation; thus, the need to use existing system familiarity and expertise isvirtually unavoidable. Furthermore, doing so lessens the risk of failure to implementrequirements per the guidelines set by USAID which incidentally keeps NASA in goodstanding with the USAID and promotes future collaboration. SSAI having previouslyprovided technical support to the SERVIR project is familiar with the SERVIR system andhas the required expertise readily available. SERVIR is a high-visibility project at NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ and USAID.  It is also themodel in the Americas for the Global Earth Observation System of Systemsa multinationaleffort to build an earth observation system.  It is also a key implementation projectunder the Central American-United States Joint Accord signed by U.S. Secretary of StateColin Powell on June 7, 2001. For these reasons, it is of benefit to NASA to maintain itsaffiliation with an institution like SSAI that is well recognized in the geospatialcommunity and consistently performs exceptionally well amid the high demands that go handin hand with high-visibility.SSAI has an existing relationship with SERVIRs international partner, the Water Centerfor the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC), which hosts andoperates the SERVIR system in Mesoamerica. This existing relationship will helpfacilitate the transfer of technology to the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources forDevelopment (RCMRD) which will host and operate the SERVIR-like system in East Africa.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon Tuesday, September 16, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Government has a requirement for replacement bearings for its WSR-88D (NEXRAD) system, a tri-agency Doppler weather radar.  An engineering analysis by the Radar Operation Center has determined that replacement parts as listed above are necessary to the continued operation of the system.  The NEXRAD is a network of 158 high-resolution Doppler weather radars.  The WSR-88 was developed to replace the WSR-74 and was first deployed in 1988, becoming fully operational nationwide in 1997.  The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning clear-air mode for analyzing air movements when there is little or no activity in the area, and a precipitation mode with a faster scan time for tracking active weather. NEXRAD has an increased emphasis on automation, including the use of algorithms and automated volume scans.  Since deployment, this system has aged and is now suffering significant failures of Pedestal bull gear and bearing parts.  In order to continue service, the NWS requires additional stock of the above items to repair the NEXRAD.  These parts were designed and manufactured by Avon Bearings, Inc and the data rights to the design are owned by DRS Surveillance Systems, Inc.  As the Government has no rights to the design, it cannot fully specify the design to another manufacturer.  Any attempt to duplicate the design would be cost-prohibitive and infringe on the rights of the current owner.  Due to the unique physical characteristics and physical form of the assembly, there are no acceptable alternative parts.
The period of performance for this effort is for 5 months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by Monday, September 8, 2008. 
This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>Fluidics Upgrade for BD Bioscience FACSAria Cell Sorter
<SOLNBR>NCI-80210-MM
<RESPDATE>091608
<CONTACT>Melissa P Marino, Phone 301-402-4509, Fax 301-402-4513, Email marinome@mail.nih.gov - Caren N Rasmussen, Lead Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email cr214i@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis for a BD FACSAria Fluidics Upgrade with BD Biosciences 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics apply to the Special BD FACSAria Upgrade:</p>
<p>1.	Replacement of intermediate plenum system on current FACSAria with a direct pressure system.  Must be compatible with existing FACSAria system.</p>
<p>2.	Upgrade of current fluidics cart with pressurized sheath tank, replacing earlier non-pressurized sheath tanks.</p>
<p>3.	Modifications to flow cell and sort nozzle, with improved zirconium nozzle inserts to replace previous metal/ceramic versions.  A special non-sorting zirconium nozzle will also be included in this upgrade package, allowing simpler operation of the instrument during analysis-only (non-sorting) applications.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-(b)(1)</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1) 	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p><br />The FACS Core maintains a BD Biosciences FACSAria cell sorter to supplement the cell sorting capabilities provided by our existing FACSVantage, and to provide additional sorting to the Pediatric Oncology and Dermatology Branches.  This cell sorter uses an erarlier-generation two-stage fluidic system, allowing mid-sort tank refills without interrupting sorting.  However, this two-stage system has proven to be very complex and prone to breakdown, requiring large amounts of instrument service and occasional downtime.  In 2007, BD Biosciences did a significant redesign of the FACSAria, eliminating the two-stage fluidic system and going back to a more traditional one-stage system.  The FACSAria II, the next generation of the FACSAria series, has this one-stage system.  In addition, BD Biosciences has offered upgrades of older FACSAria two-stage systems to this one-stage system.  We are requesting this upgrade.  This upgrade should make the older FACSAria system more reliable and less prone to breakdown and downtime, as well as reducing servicing requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on September 16, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80210-MM on all correspondence.</p>

The purpose of this rolling admission is to allow 8(a) contractors to apply for a Seaport e basic contract.  This rolling admission will result in the award of additional Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) prime contracts.  Existing Seaport-e prime contractors will also have the opportunity to expand their presence in other geographical zones to allow them to compete for Task Order awards in those zones.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 and the revenue size standard for Small Business is $25 Million.
Current Seaport-e contracts have the following characteristics:
-Offers are evaluated on Best Value-ID/IQ contracts with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price- Incentive (FPI), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee(CPFF), Cost-Plus- Incentive-Fee (CPIF), and Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type Task Orders.  No Time-and-Material (T&M) task orders are allowed.-All requirements are fulfilled competitively on a task order basis by individual ordering offices.-Heavy emphasis is placed on Performance Based Orders-Seaport-e program goal is to award 33% of total obligated dollars to small businesses as prime contractors.-Large business awards have a minimum Small Business Subcontracting Goal of 20% of the dollars obligated.-Only one ID/IQ contract award is allowed for individual companies as a Prime; however a contractor may be a subcontractor to multiple Primes.-Task Orders are competed in one of seven geographic zones (Northeast, National Capital, Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest) based on the place of performance for the solicited requirements.-Task orders are competed in the zone that is the principal place of performance.-The basic ID/IQ contracts limits pass-through charges, caps maximum fees, annual escalation, and requires cost savings.
Awards made during the rolling admission process will have the same or similar characteristics.
Oral proposals will not be conducted.  Awards will be made on initial offers without discussions.  
Note:  Historically, a full and open rolling admission has been conducted on an annual basis.  This current rolling admission is limited to 8(a) contractors only.  It is anticipated that the next full and open rolling admission will be conducted in FY10.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), Panama City, Florida is soliciting competitive quotes to purchase five (5) each battery chargers that can meet the needs of the main propulsion and electronics battery for the AN/ASQ 235 (AMNS) Exercise Neutralizer, and be suitable for fleet use.  This battery charger will be required to charge up to four destructors at one time and will need a simple and intuitive control panel for ease of operation.  The case which the battery charger is located in should be water tight when closed and the internal packaging of the battery charger should allow it to withstand ship board shock loads without damaging the electronics.  A total of five (5) battery chargers will be needed to support the various testing, and training agendas between the two programs.  Charging the destructor battery requires application of 12 volts DC to a relay within the destructor.  The relay draws approximately one ampere of current.  Th! e relay closes the circuit connecting the positive lead from the destructor battery to the connector on the exterior of the destructor.  The relay is energized by a pin within the same 4-pin connector on the destructor hull used to charge the battery.  The current scenario is to apply the 12 volt, DC signal from a separate power supply.  The required delivery date will be within 120 days after contract award.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination to NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida 32407.   The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 35999.  The solicitation closing date is 15 September 2008.  The resultant awardee must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/ .  A paper registration form may be obtained from the Department of Defense Electronic Commerce Inform! ation center at 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center (FISC), Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division intends to acquire auditory research scientist services in support of the Spatial Orientation Center, Department of Otolaryngology, Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD). The scope of duties for the research is to plan, design, coordinate, write and conduct a series of experiments to evaluate issues regarding the mechanisms of noise-induced and chemically-induced inner ear injury and the use of drug treatments and/or chemical agents to prevent and restore inner ear function.
FISC intends to award a purchase order to satisfy the proposed acquisition as a sole source action under authority of FAR 6.302 to John KM Coleman, Ph.D, of San Diego, CA 92111. The placement of a firm fixed price purchase order for one year, to begin 1 October 2008, is anticipated. Dr. Coleman currently serves as a project leader on the Blast Overpressure program and is the program leader for the physiological and behavioral portions of this project. Without this contractor, the current research projects will be delayed resulting in a loss of resources and failure to meet deadlines. This delay of research will prevent the timely completion of animal trials which in consequence would delay the start of proposed human trials research and will ultimately detain the development of agents that may restore hearing function in patients with different types of hearing loss. This contractor is the only known auditory research scientist who has the unique experience and capabilities ! to successfully support the auditory research scientist services while conforming to the timeline required to accomplish the research projects in progress at this laboratory. The solicitation number is N00189-08-R-0050 and the applicable NAICS code is 541711. Please direct any questions concerning this purchase order to Lauren Lauver via email at Lauren.lauver@navy.mil.

SUP 5252.213-9401 	NOTICE TO PROSPECIVE SUPPLIERS (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navys Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government. As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each suppliers past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased. The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled, Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.
SUP 5252.213-9402	 ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST 				 PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navys Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet.
(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class (es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk) or neutral (no risk established).
(c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each suppliers quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved. The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSCs involved. No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification. For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old. After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charge! s, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award. A suppliers FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.
(d) RYG classifications are summarized as follows:
(1) Green is low risk. No performance assurance actions are considered necessary. No TEA will be assessed. 
(2) Yellow is moderate risk. Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary. A TEA will be applied to the prospective suppliers price to reflect the Governments estimated additional costs.
(3) Red is high risk. Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary. A TEA will be applied to the prospective suppliers price to reflect the Governments estimated additional costs.
(4) Neutral is no risk established. No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.
(e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them. Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Systems Logistics Center (NLSC), Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH 03801-3884, telephone (603) 431-9460, ext. 464, FAX 603-431-9464. Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program. To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address. The request must include the requesters name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code. The CAGE code is mandatory. In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This application is restricted to American Science & Engineering, Inc. (AS&E), 829 Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, MA 01821.  Offers from concerns other than the above are not solicited.  This synopsis is published for subcontracting purposes only.  The Tank Automotive and Armaments Command of the US Army has requirements to provide comprehensive maintenance, sustainment, and training for Z-Backscatter Vans (ZBV) and Ruggedized Detection and Imaging Modules (RDIM) located in Southwest Asia (SWA)for a 3-year period starting in September of 2008.  The ZBV and RDIM are used to inspect other vehicles and shipping containers for possible contraband, unauthorized personnel or explosives.  The process of inspection involves the use of X-ray inspection methods.  The Mercedes Benz chassis that carries the inspection equipment is also included in the maintenance plan and the source sought will be responsible for acquiring and providing the necessary spare parts and consumables required for routine preventative maintenance and unscheduled repairs due to break down for the chassis as well as for the inspection devices and systems.  The ZBV are scattered throughout SWA and movement from one location to another may require armed security escorts.  The requiring agency is not in a position to provide technical details regarding either the chassis or its inspections system.  This solicitation will not be issued electronically.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to award a non-competitive purchase order to Heritage Group Inc. of Littleton, CO, for the purchase of one each, Syscal Pro Switch 96 Resistivity System, to include console, battery charger, 12V external power cable, data transfer cable, cable for 96 electrodes at 5m spacing, 96 electrodes with connecting clips, and ProSys and Electre Pro software, and one each, Res3DInv Software, to include 2D version.  This is the latest model electrical resistance tomography system that has the capability of captuing dynamic changes in soil moisture faster than any other system on the market.  It has 10 input channels.  For use in determining subsurface hydrology from infiltration experiments, the increased temporal resolution makes it possible to investigate important physical phenomena (e.g., time-varying infiltration processes in desert soils) that are too dynamic for detection with slower systems.  Heritage Group Inc. is the only source known that distributes this equipment.  The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to the Contract Specialist by e-mail (rpaprocki@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in the announcement.

<DESC>Under Authority One on Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements FAR 6.302-1 for developing therapeutics against Staphylococcal Enterotoxin (SE) exposure, we have established the proof-of-concept that the same MyD88 mediated pro-inflammatory signaling is critical to SE intoxication. A simple dose-response relationship was noted for pro-inflammatory cytokines and SE induced toxic shock. Further, the genes in these mice had impaired pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to SEs and were resistant to a lethal SE challenge. Our results demonstrate that MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory signaling is responsible for SE toxicity. Since our animal model relied on the use of MyD88 knockout mice from Charles River Laboratories, it is essential to use the same string of breeding to continue our research for developing therapeutics to accomplish the task. This is a continuation of an ongoing project we had in place last year with Charles River Laboratory.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on this notice to solely award within the descretion of the Government.  The formal J&A for Other Than Full and Open Competition is added below.  Detailed capabilities, proposal or quote must be submitted to the following email address no later than 9:00 a.m. E.S.T., September 17, 2008.  Email proposals to erin.becker@amedd.army.mil.<BR><BR>Below is the Formal J&A for Other Then Full and Open Competition for your review:<BR><BR>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition Justification<BR><BR><BR>1. Description of Action:  Approval is being requested for a new contract to acquire research supplies. This approval is being requested for a new firm-fixed-price contract using R&D funds.<BR><BR>2. Description of Supplies/Services:  We are requesting that Charles River Laboratory will house, breed, and provide 100 MyD88 knockout mice.  Total number of animals to be shipped is 100.  This will approximately take 1 year.  They will perform a complete health monitoring and Helicobacter PCR on a quarterly basis as stated in the contract. The contract amount will be approximately $28,765.50.<BR><BR>3. Reason for Authority Cited:  <BR>Authority One on Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements FAR 6.302-1.  In our ongoing research effort funded by DTRA for developing therapeutics against Staphylococcal Enterotoxin (SE) exposure, we have established the proof-of-concept that the same MyD88 mediated pro-inflammatory signaling is critical to SE intoxication. A simple dose-response relationship was noted for pro-inflammatory cytokines and SE induced toxic shock. Further, the genes in these mice had impaired pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to SEs and were resistant to a lethal SE challenge. Our results demonstrate that MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory signaling is responsible for SE toxicity. Since our animal model relied on the use of MyD88 knockout mice from Charles River Laboratories, it is essential to use the same string of breeding to continue our research for developing therapeutics to accomplish the task. This is a continuation of an ongoing project we had in place last year with Charles River Laboratory.<BR><BR>4. Actions to Increase Competition:  It is not possible to compete the current acquisition due to the critical and precise nature of the research supplies requested.   Charles River procured the mice from Oriental Bioservice which is the only source available for this type of MyD88 knockout mice and they will continue to maintain and breed by mating scheme homozygous vs. homozygous.<BR><BR>5. Market Research:  Extent and the results of the market research (One on Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements FAR 6.302-1) conducted to identify all qualified sources conducted within the past 30 days.  The requested knockout mice are required for a DTRA funded research plan, which will allow no substitutions due to the nature of the data we require.   <BR><BR>6.	Other facts:  <BR><BR>a.  Procurement history.  The previous award for this requirement was W81XWH-07-P-0027.  The prices per animal and shipment have increased with the increase in fuel surcharges.<BR>b. It is not being competed because in order to maintain the merit and validity of scientific research, there is only one source that can render the service.<BR>c.  In order to establish the reproducible results, these MyD88 gene knockout mice must come from the same breed (genetic background) and same source (Charles River Laboratories). <BR><BR>7.  Technical Certification:  <BR><BR>I justify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<BR><BR>Typed Name: 	KAMAL UDDIN SAIKH				Date:  Sept. 2, 2008<BR><BR>Title: Principal Research Investigator 	Signature:  -Signed-<BR>	<BR>8.  Requirements Certification:  Include the following statement:  I certify that the following data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<BR><BR>Typed Name: 	KAMAL UDDIN SAIKH			Date:  Sept. 2, 2008<BR><BR>Title: 	Principal Research Investigator	Signature:   -Signed-<BR><BR>Signature:  -Signed-<BR>Typed Name:  Pamela E.

<p>HHS is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. The Department oversees more than 300 programs covering a wide spectrum of activities.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the near future on behalf of the, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).</p>
<p>The CDC intends to re-compete the Technical Support for the Advisory Board on Radiation and <br />Worker Health's Review of NIOSH Dose Reconstruction Program contract, CDC contract number 200-2004-03805. Firms that have Conflicts of Interests while perfroming work under the NIOSH ORAU Dose Reconstruction Contract or other inherit Conflict of Interest will not be considered. The draft Statement of Work is attached. Interested parties may view a full spectrum of documents on the program at the NIOSH internet site - http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/.</p>
<p>The CDC Office of Compensation Analysis and Support (OCAS) is responsible for conducting individual dose reconstructions on employees of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies, its contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs) under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA). To support NIOSH's role under EEOICPA, OCAS has retained the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of major program elements. Under EEOICPA, the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (Advisory Board), is required to review a reasonable sample of dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality, assess the methods for dose reconstruction, and review Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) petitions. To support the Advisory Board, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of tasks related to independent review of the dose reconstruction process.</p>
<p>Please note that failure to specifically address each of the items below in your capability statement may affect further consideration of your capability to successfully perform the requirement. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the capability of your firm. The capability statement must specifically address ALL of the following information; otherwise no further evaluation of your capability statement will be performed. The capability statement must demonstrate that your organization/company has the skills/qualifications for the following general requirements:</p>
<p>A. Individual dose reconstructions review</p>
<p>The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the reconstruction of dose provides a reasonable estimate of the dose (as needed to adjudicate the claim). The contractor shall evaluate and recommend whether or not the assumptions (individual case assumptions and assumptions applicable to multiple cases) made for dose reconstruction are appropriate and defensible for purposes of this program. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the data from DOE or other sources is of sufficient quality necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate of dose. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the dose reconstruction was performed fairly using NIOSH guidelines and in a manner consistent with other cases.</p>
<p>The contractor shall review all relevant dose reconstruction methodologies and/or procedures employed by NIOSH / NIOSH contractors in conducting individual dose reconstructions and SEC petitions. The contractor shall evaluate whether methodologies and procedures are consistent with requirements under 42 CFR 82 and whether there are sufficient procedures to achieve consistent application of the requirements in 42 CFR 82.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct one of three different levels of review on the selected cases: 1) Basic Review, 2) Advanced Review, or 3) Blind Review. The method of review will be determined by the Advisory Board. The number of individual dose reconstruction reviews is estimated to be approximately 62 in the first year. It is expected that there will be approximately 30 Basic Review cases, 30 Advanced Review cases and 2 Blind Review cases. The next four years will also involve a review of approximately 62 cases per year. The breakdown of cases will be the same as described for the first year. The Advisory Board shall determine the cases to be reviewed and the level of review. These percentages are subject to change by the Advisory Board based on experience with the review process.</p>
<p>The elements of each type of review are detailed below:</p>
<p>1. Basic Review</p>
<p>A. Review Data Collection</p>
<p>Evaluate whether NIOSH received all requested data for the DOE or AWE site from any relevant data source or repository<br />Evaluate whether the data used by NIOSH for the case was adequate to make a determination with regard to probability of causation.</p>
<p>B. Review Interview and Documentation provided by claimant</p>
<p>Evaluate whether NIOSH appropriately addressed all of the reported work history and events represented by the claimant including but not limited to a) incidents or occurrences, b) actual monitoring practices, c) personal protection practices, and d) work practices</p>
<p>Assure that interview information is consistent with data used for the dose estimate, and if not, evaluate whether reasonable justification is provided.</p>
<p>Review Internal and External Dose Estimates</p>
<p>Evaluate whether all assumptions used in the dose determination are appropriate for a remedial compensation program and whether the benefit of the doubt was resolved in favor of the claimant</p>
<p>Verify dose calculations are appropriate for purposes of determination of Probability of Causation (POC)</p>
<p>Evaluate whether the data were consistent with site radiological monitoring protocols of the time period.</p>
<p>Evaluate the treatment of &lsquo;missed dose' and/or &lsquo;unmonitored dose' if relevant to the case.</p>
<p>The review of each dose reconstruction shall include an evaluation of all relevant portions of the methods and/or procedures used by NIOSH. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>Review the internal and external radiation dose reconstruction technical basis documents,<br />Review of methods for estimating &lsquo;missed dose' and &lsquo;un-monitored dose' (for cases related to monitoring technology and for cases where monitoring was not performed, monitoring data is not available or incomplete or otherwise inadequate), <br />Review of the statistical approaches developed for multiple dose reconstructions,<br />Review procedures used for determining whether data are sufficient to make a reasonable dose estimate, <br />Review methods or procedures used for substituting exposure information for unavailable or incomplete information, <br />Review methods for estimating uncertainty in dose and uncertainty distributions surrounding internal and external dose reconstructions on a facility and time specific basis and evaluate whether the benefit of the doubt was resolved in favor of the claimant where there were uncertainties,<br />Review procedures and questionnaire used for work history phone interview, and<br />Review the NIOSH methods, procedures and performance in evaluating, analyzing and validating all contractor work products.</p>
<p>2. Advanced Review</p>
<p>The Advanced Review will include all task items in the Basic Review along with the additional tasks listed below:</p>
<p>Review Data Gathering</p>
<p>Review the entire administrative record to evaluate if relevant information exists which was not considered by NIOSH.</p>
<p>Review the relevant aspects of the Site Profile as they apply to the individual case and evaluate the adequacy and completeness of the site profile and evaluate whether the information from the site profile is consistent with the information used for the individual dose estimate.</p>
<p>Evaluate whether, to the extent practicable, all relevant sources of data (e.g., DOE, AWE, CDC, Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC) , Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), External Health and Safety Regulators, Government Accounting Office (GAO) , Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB), Congressional Hearing Records, other research programs, research publications, publications regarding the history of the DOE complex, or administrative/court records) were identified, evaluated and where appropriate, included within the Site Profile database and where appropriate were used in the assessment of the individual dose reconstruction case.</p>
<p>Review Work History Interview and Documentation provided by claimant</p>
<p>Evaluate the effectiveness of the phone interview in ascertaining relevant work history information.</p>
<p>Evaluate whether, for the cases involving survivors, there has been an adequate effort to research co-located workers and other historical records to characterize the individual's work history.</p>
<p>Review Internal and External Dose Estimates</p>
<p>Evaluate whether the dose estimate is consistent with relevant radiological information within the NIOSH site profile (e.g. air monitoring, wipe data are consistent with bioassay results)</p>
<p>Compare case information and assumptions with relevant co-worker case information and assumptions for consistency</p>
<p>3. Blind Dose Reconstruction</p>
<p>Using all raw data available to NIOSH, the independent expert will develop an Interactive RadioEpidemiological Program ( IREP) dose input file that they feel is sufficient to make a determination with regard to POC.</p>
<p>B. NIOSH OCAS &lsquo;Site Profile' and &lsquo;Worker Profile' Review</p>
<p>As part of NIOSH's effort in completing individual dose reconstructions, NIOSH is establishing a &lsquo;Site Profile' database for all covered sites. This database includes records relevant to dose reconstruction other than the personnel dosimetry records (e.g. - process information, characterization information, incident or occurrence reports, summary dosimetric information, etc.). The contractor shall review selected site profiles established by NIOSH to evaluate the quality and completeness of the profiles and the adequacy of the data for purposes of individual dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>The contractor shall review the conditions, processes, practices and incidents at selected DOE and AWE facilities covered under EEOICPA to evaluate the adequacy of the information available in the NIOSH Site Profile. The review should focus on whether the approach used by NIOSH assured completeness of data necessary for purposes of determining individual eligibility for compensation. The review should include a evaluation of whether NIOSH identified, evaluated and where appropriate incorporated all relevant data sources (e.g., DOE, AWE, CDC, EML, NRC, EPA, External Health and Safety Regulators, GAO, DNFSB, Congressional Hearing Records, other research programs, research publications, publications regarding the history of the DOE complex, or administrative/court records) within the site profile. One task in evaluating that the data identification and collection process were adequate may require the contractor to conduct interviews (one-on-one or group) with, employees, employee representatives, advocacy organizations, health and academic researchers and site &lsquo;experts' (those with long standing knowledge of processes, materials, events, and exposures). The contractor may be required to conduct meetings with these individuals or groups at locations near the facilities of interest.</p>
<p>As part of NIOSH's effort in completing individual dose reconstructions and SEC Petition evaluations, NIOSH is establishing a &lsquo;Procedures' database to assist in the performance of such efforts. The contractor shall review selected "Procedures" established by NIOSH to evaluate the quality and completeness of the "Procedures" and the adequacy of the "Procedures" for purposes of individual dose reconstructions and SEC Petition evaluations.</p>
<p>It is expected that there will be 30 "Procedures" Reviews and 6 Site Profile Reviews in the first year and in each subsequent year of the contract</p>
<p>C. Review of SEC Petitions<br />42 CFR Part 83, Procedures for Designating Classes of Employees as Members of the Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA of 2000, describes the general procedures to be followed in the review of SEC Petitions. Section 83.15 describes how the Board will consider and advise the Secretary of HHS on a petition.<br />The contractor shall evaluate Special Exposure Cohort petitions as requested consistent with the provisions of 83.14 and 83.15. Such reviews may focus on the availability and reliability of documents and monitoring data as well as an analysis of the methods proposed by NIOSH to accomplish individual dose reconstructions for members of a considered class. In cases where a site profile is available for a site in question the contractor will make use of such a document. In cases where no site profile is available the contractor will need to develop the basic information needed to evaluate the SEC Petition.<br />In some cases it may be necessary for the contractor to interview workers and/or site experts to accomplish this task.<br />At the recommendation of the Board, the contractor may be asked to review either the complete SEC Petition or just an aspect of the petition as designated by the Board.<br />In a given year of contract performance, it is anticipated that the contractor will review three complete SEC Petitions and an aspect or aspects of three other petitions.<br />The Contractor shall note if any staff have current Q Type Security clearances.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this contract is 60 months.</p>
<p>Interested organizations should submit their written capability statements by 10:00 a.m. on May 16, 2008 to the Contracting Officer at the following e-mail address: dstaudt@cdc.gov. Any questions must be submitted to the Contracting Officer in writing to the email address listed.</p>
<p>Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date. Page Limit is 25 pages. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Capability statements must also include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g., small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business).</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE NOR OTHERWISE PAY FOR PREPARING ANY INFORMATION SENT OR THE GOVERNMENTS USE OF THE INFORMATION.</p>
<p>Any proprietary information should be so marked. No solicitation is available at this time.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide Development of Educational Campaigns and Materials for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The role of FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN's) Office of Food Defense, Communication, and Emergency Response (OFDCER) has evolved over the years to include information and outreach on CFSAN programs for producers, transporters, operators of retail establishments, health professionals along with extensive, hands-on food safety and nutrition education programs for consumers including children, older Americans, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women. Education is critical because consumers are the ?final link? in the food chain that runs from the farm to the table.

Over the years, FDA?s education campaigns have kept pace with burgeoning new technology, scientific advances, new risks and potential pathogens, and types of foods being offered to U.S. consumers.

The agency continues to inform consumers about safe food handling and preparation, and gives them the information they need to prepare healthy, nutritious meals for themselves and their families.

CFSAN?s food safety education efforts typically support the Partnership for Food Safety Education's Fight BAC! and Be Food Safe messages, for food safety, various guidelines and good manufacturing practices documents developed by CFSAN for sectors of the food industry, or focus on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the nutrition facts label, for nutrition. Educational materials are targeted to a variety of audiences including, but not limited to, the media, schools, health professionals, and specific groups of consumers who are at-risk for nutritional deficiencies or foodborne illness, including pregnant women, young children, senior citizens and those who are immunocompromised. Educational materials must take into consideration such factors as reading ability and language requirements and design preferences. Determining the most effective communication strategies, e.g., brochures, video, video news releases, public service announcements, and/or web-based, is also critical to effectively conveying the food safety message.

Under FDA's new Food Protection Plan CFSAN is given major responsibilities for educating consumers and the food industry about prevention of foodborne illness, communicating with the public during food emergencies, and improving the effectiveness of recalls of human and pet food products.

The objective of the contract is to develop educational campaigns and materials covering food safety and nutrition.

The contractor will be required to: 1) recommend, coordinate, and administer research-based educational strategies to reach particular target audiences or to convey specific messages; 2) write and/or design materials for review and make changes/corrections based on comments from CFSAN. This process may take up to three iterations before final work is approved. These materials include, but are not limited to web content, brochures, press kits, fact sheets, videos, classroom materials, patient handouts, and promotional items; 3) prepare print or audio-visual materials for duplication by delivering finished materials in an appropriate format (i.e., disk, beta-tape, etc.) with all required forms completed and 4) review printing and/or production processes when requested by checking proof sheets or onsite monitoring of the printing process.

Contractors must submit a capability statement (five page limitation) describing their company's experience and ability to: 1. Conduct independent education campaigns 2. Provide information on a broad range of food safety, nutrition, and related public health topics 3. Include target audience analysis and state of the art research methods 4. Provide details on how the education campaigns were conducted/managed 5. List experience as a multidisciplinary education campaign organization that covers food safety and nutrition.

An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract is expected with a base year with four one year options. The NAICS code for this effort is 541820 with a size standard of $6.5 million. Interested offerors must provide (1) company?s name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, website address, and point of contact (2) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (3) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; resumes for proposed key personnel should be included; (4) if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages) (submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm?s status); (5) DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). (6) Companies must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as a potential source; (7) identification of the firm?s GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are requested and (8) if the company has a government approved accounting system, identify the agency that approved the system.

This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or indication the Government will contract for the work contained in this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. Responses to this announcement will not be returned, nor will there be any discussions or debriefings of any responses. This announcement is Government market research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.

Responses must be sent to this notice no later than 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time on September 18, 2008 submitted by email, courier or U.S. Postal Service to the attention of Mr. Tariq Choudry, Contract Specialist at the above stated address.

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.
REGULATIONThe Government is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997):(a) All information submitted in response to this SSN is voluntary.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately and will be controlled and secured. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying contract approaches that will ensure fair competition, minimize transition risks, and maximize the value of Grants.gov system. 
BACKGROUNDGrants.gov, available through www.grants.gov, provides a one-stop electronic portal where potential grant recipients can find and apply for Federal grant opportunities. The program is supported by all 26 of the major Federal grant-making agencies, with The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the managing partner.  The system provides the capability for granting organizations to post descriptions of grant opportunities along with electronic grant application packages, and to download completed grant applications.  It provides the capability for applicants to search grant opportunities, register to receive notices of new opportunities, download application packages, complete applications off-line, and securely upload completed applications.  Upon receipt of the application, Grants.gov sends an electronic acknowledgement to the applicant and delivers the application to the agency.  The system provides these functions through both a Web-based graphical user interface and a Web-services-based system-to-system interface.Since October 2003, all 26 grant-making agencies have posted their discretionary funding opportunities on Grants.gov.  For the period of October - August 2008 over 420 discretionary grant opportunities have been posted.  Additionally, over 440 application packages have been posted and approximately 190,000 electronic applications have been received from applicants.  Grants.gov sends over 1 million email notifications per week at the public's request, and receives over 1.2 million page views.  
OBJECTIVES  The core business of Grants.gov is: forms (development with business rules, testing, and deployment); the data residing on or within the form; and the transmission of said data between customers (applicants and grantor agencies) via Grants.gov. At the present time Grants.gov owns and manages the information technology system that ensures the fulfillment of its core business. Grants.gov is re-aligning its business efforts to allow it to focus principally on its core business. This means that Grants.gov will no longer be in the ownership and management of IT. As a consequence, Grants.gov anticipates pursuing the acquisition of a "cloud computing" environment to include but not limited to service-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) capability to fulfill its mission needs. From a mission perspective, a cloud computing environment possessing the follow capabilities would be considered as a viable candidate to establish a relationship with Grants.gov:
1.	An established capability (technology and staff) to develop (with business rules), test, deploy, host, manage, and maintain forms on a single integrated technological environment (minimizing development & deployment costs, & allowing for rapid forms deployment);2.	Delivers a compelling user experience;3.	Built-in Scalability (up and down on demand), Reliability, and Security;4.	Built-in integration with web services and databases (maximum leveraging of existing software & third-party web services);5.	Supports applicant collaboration (particularly in fellowship & complex/multi-project settings to meet applicant and grantor expectations); 6.	Deep application instrumentation (to allow for highly granular analysis of user activities to enable future cost recovery models for grantors based on system usage vice flat or subscription fees);7.	Supports existing grantor and applicant system-to-system connectivity within the federal grants community; and an8.	Ability to advise Grants.gov on forms development & management oversight to minimize duplication.The platform must, at a minimum, support the existing Grants.gov functions including the following:
"	A "Find" capability that provides the ability to publish, search, and manage the expiration of opportunities, and export or syndicate opportunity data.  "	An "Apply" capability that supports the definition and management of application packages; submission, receipt, processing (including data validation, XML data extraction, and PDF generation), delivery, and status monitoring of applications."	A user management capability that supports multi-level organizational affiliations and role-based access to Grants.gov functions, and E-Authentication integration."	Reporting capabilities to include canned and flexible ad-hoc reports that can be created or requested by PMO staff and system users.  Reports would include forms and system usage statistics, opportunity information, and submission statistics (such as the number of opportunities and application packages posted and submissions received by agency for period of time and for the system as a whole. "	Test Site capability for both grantor agencies and applicants. "	Help desk / technical support capabilities to grantors agencies and applicants. "	System documentation and training tools.          
CONSTRAINTS
"	The government has made a considerable investment in the software and hardware that is now used by the Grants.gov integration contractor but owned by the government.  While the government is interested moving to a cloud computing environment, the government also has an interest in leveraging investments that have already been made to the maximum extent possible.  This software / hardware can be used partially or wholly in any solution for follow-on services that is contracted.
"	The current system is Section 508 compliant and any solution must maintain this compliance.
"	Irrespective of the desire to consider new environment for Grants.gov, the transition to a new services contractor must occur within a very tight constraint that would result in a seamless continuation of current service levels.  It is currently contemplated that the entire operational capability would need to transition in no more than 45 days."	The standards desired for any software or network components made part of the solution should be compatible with the Federal Enterprise Architecture standards. 
"	Personnel that work on any aspect of this program may be required to have access to Privacy Information.  These personnel shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. code, Section 552a and applicable agency rules and regulations."	Any solution proposed must comply with and meet the Computer Security Act of 1987; Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, "Security of Federal Automated Information Systems"; and the DHHS Automated Information Systems Security Program (AISSP) Handbook (Release 2.0 dated May 1994).This is a data gathering, fact finding effort.  The goal is to identify potential offerors with the best solution.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail to donald.abamonte@aqd.nbc.gov by 11:00am EDT on September 30, 2008. NOTE: Due to e-mail server and pipeline limitations, please limit the size of each e-mail with attachments to 3 MB. If you have any questions regarding this request, please contact Donald Abamonte at the e-mail address listed above.  Telephonic or Facsimile inquiries will not be accepted as an official record of all correspondence is necessary.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases.  The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts. 

Over the past two decades, attention has been focused on the disproportionate burden of asthma on minority populations, particularly African-American and Hispanic residents of U.S. inner cities. Since 1991, DAIT NIAID has supported research programs to develop effective behavioral, educational and environmental interventions to reduce asthma severity among inner city children.
The NIAID Inner City Asthma Consortium was established in FY2002 under a contract to the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The current NIAID Inner City Asthma Consortium is composed of an administrative center and ten clinical sites. A separate contract to establish and operate a Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center to support the clinical research program of the Consortium is in place. Ongoing and completed studies have focused on the standardization of cockroach allergens and on biomarker evaluation to guide asthma treatment. Ongoing studies include a prospective, longitudinal evaluation of environmental factors that influence the development of the immune system and asthma and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of immunotherapeutic modalities.  
The Inner City Asthma Consortium will expand its focus on the immunopathogenesis of asthma in inner city populations through the addition of Basic Science Sites. 
The overall objectives of the Inner City Asthma Consortium are to: 
1.	Design and conduct clinical studies with the goals of a) improving asthma control, b) preventing the development of asthma in children residing in the inner cities of the United States using primarily immune system-targeting interventions, and c) improving asthma phenotyping using validated biomarkers. 
2.	Design and conduct longitudinal birth cohort studies with the goals of a) providing novel information on the early immunopathogenesis of asthma, b) identifying risk factors for the development of asthma in children residing in the inner cities of the United States, c) understanding differences in the early immunopathogenesis of asthma between inner city and non-inner city children, and d) developing studies to prevent the development of asthma. 

3. 	Design and conduct mechanistic studies involving human subjects with the goal of elucidating the immunopathogenesis of asthma in the inner city environment.
4. 	Develop, validate and implement basic science methodology to support the studies conducted under objectives 1, 2 and 3 listed above.

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 2009, with an anticipated annual total effort of approximately 67.8 FTEs for the base period. 

Potential sources must demonstrate and document their ability to perform the  following in their capability statements:

The Contractor shall a) establish and maintain eight (8) Clinical Study Sites to recruit children and adult subjects primarily among U.S. inner city populations and conduct clinical studies with subjects recruited from these populations; b) establish and maintain two (2) Basic Science Sites to design studies involving human subjects to test mechanistic hypotheses on the immunopathogenesis of asthma in the inner city populations, to develop, validate and implement basic science methodology to support the primary outcomes of these mechanistic studies, and to serve as core laboratories for the measurement of laboratory outcomes or train and assist technical personnel at the clinical study sites to perform these measurements; c) design and execute clinical trials and cross-sectional clinical studies to improve asthma control, prevent the development of asthma in children residing in the inner cities of the U.S., using primarily immune system-targeting interventions, and improve asthma phenotyping using validated biomarkers; d) continue, for an additional five (5) years, the Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma (URECA) longitudinal birth cohort study that was designed and initiated under the current Consortium contract; e) design and execute other longitudinal birth cohort studies to provide novel information on the early immunopathogenesis of asthma, identify risk factors for the development of asthma in children residing in the inner cities of the U.S., enhance our understanding of the differences in the early immunopathogenesis of asthma between inner city and non-inner city children, and lead to new studies to prevent the development of asthma; f) design and execute mechanistic studies involving human subjects with the goal of elucidating the immunopathogenesis of asthma in the inner city environment; g) develop, validate and implement basic science methodology to support all clinical studies; h) coordinate and collaborate with the Consortium Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center in providing a broad range of clinical research support services, including development of protocol-related materials, data collection, management and quality control, and the analysis of final study data.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>     The Southeast Region TRBO Reg. 3 and 4, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities MTFs in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation RFRIAQ for the standardization of EXAM TABLE PAPER. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or sources at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center FT Gordon, GA, Winn Army Community Hospital  FT Stewart, GA, Martin Army Community Hospital  FT Benning, GA, Naval Hospital Jacksonville  NAS Jacksonville, FL, 96 Medical Group Eglin AFB, FL, Naval Hospital Pensacola , FL, Naval Hospital Beaufort Beaufort, SC, 81  Medical Group Keesler AFB, MS and the 6 Medical Group MacDill AFB, FL.  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia DSCP, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements RIAs that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two years 24 months from date of selection with three 12 month option periods not to exceed 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is November 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical performance and technical company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical Company and Clinical Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value  trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.    Point of Contact:  Ginny Slayton, 706 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   <BR><BR><BR><BR>B.	Products and Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of EXAM TABLE PAPER, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of 88,362.97 dollars.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12 month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.

Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing per the FBO RFQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri Service Product Review Board TPRB is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing  based on committed volume of 80 percent of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I   Technical Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet provide responses to the technical company criteria stated below.  All technical company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Tri Service Product Review Board TPRB and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical company criteria will be qualified invited to participate in the clinicalperformance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical company criteria is defined as follows : Generally, responses to all questions in the technical company criteria demonstrate that:  1 based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; 2 the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE:  Specific technical company criteria will require an additional, more specific definition of  technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Exam Table Paper products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.	At a minimum this includes Exam Table Paper that in the sizes of 18 inches to 21 inches wide X 125 feet to 225 feet in length, adults and pediatrics styles.  The Exam Table Paper will consist of non-abrasive texture or finish e.g., smooth, and crepe-paper like, absorbent and nonabsorbent, and Latex safe free.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed. <BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied manufactured and or distributed by brands  via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Exam Table Paper product line.  Vendor MUST provide  DAPA number with initial submittal.  Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I.  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor currently, the prime vendor is Owens  and Minor for Exam Table Paper in the Southeast Region.  Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation four digit code of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12 month period for Exam Table Paper products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant i.e., positive resolutions, etc. in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide Exam Table Paper products that are recyclable or environmentally safe to discard non-toxic.  Vendor MUST provide literature to support this in response to this RFQ with initial submittal. <BR><BR>Phase II Plan   Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the TPRB, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the TRBO point of contact and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO location by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the 14  calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical performance criteria in a clinical patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one 1 not acceptable, two 2 minimally acceptable, three 3 acceptable, four 4 more acceptable, and five 5 highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical performance evaluation period will last for one 1 calendar day.  The TPRB has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The TPRB will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.00  depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores i.e., a gap between vendors average scores.  In addition, the TPRB may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process DSCP approval.<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the Tri Service Product review Board TPRB, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non clinical nonpatient care setting. <BR><BR>The following Clinical Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:         <BR>Smooth Exam Table Paper<BR>1.	Patient Safety Goal 7  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections  The Exam Table Paper is of sufficient strength to resist damage  tearing during patient examination.<BR>a.	Providing an effective preliminary barrier against contamination is necessary to reduce the risk of potential health care associated infections serving as a barrier between the patient and equipment.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will apply the examination table paper to a chair and sit on the exam paper for 15 minutes, then getting up and inspecting the exam paper for rips, holes, tears indicating that the barrier has been broken.<BR>2.	Patient Safety Goal 7  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections  The Smooth Exam Table Paper is of sufficient absorbency and provides a complete moisture barrier.  <BR>a.	Providing an effective preliminary barrier against contamination is necessary to reduce the risk of potential health care associated infections as well as to be able to withstand potential moisture applied to the paper during patient usage.<BR>b.	The evaluator will place a piece of Smooth Exam table paper on a table and place three 3 tablespoons of water randomly across the paper visualizing that the drops do not soak through.   <BR>Crepe Exam Table Paper<BR>3.	Patient Safety Goal 7  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections  The Exam Table Paper is of sufficient strength to resist damage tearing during patient examination.<BR>a.	Providing an effective preliminary barrier against contamination is necessary to reduce the risk of potential health care associated infections serving as a barrier between the patient and equipment.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will apply the examination table paper to a chair and sit on the exam paper for 15 minutes, then getting up and inspecting the exam paper for rips, holes, tears indicating that the barrier has been broken.<BR>4.	Patient Safety Goal 7  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections  The Crepe Exam Table Paper is absorbent to fluids.  <BR>a.	The Crepe Exam Table Paper is used when more absorbency is required.  This paper will not allow liquids to drip off the table and is important in providing an effective preliminary barrier against contamination.<BR>b.	The evaluator will place a piece of Crepe Exam table paper on a table and place three 3 tablespoons of water randomly across the paper visualizing that the drops absorb into the paper.     <BR>	<BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified invited to provided their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM EST, fourteen 14 calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration participation.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80 percent of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Clinical performance and technical company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical Company and Clinical Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year 24 months from date of selection with three 12 month option periods not to exceed 5 years.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  1 Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  Post-Standardization Costs.  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. 2 Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  3 Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  4 Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement DAPA price and multiplying by 12 months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.<BR>

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for systems as add-on or inherent to military Environmental Control Units (ECU) to support Nuclear/Biological/Chemical (NBC) Collective Protection (COL PRO) applications.  A COL PRO ECU would provide heating and cooling to shelters operating in areas with the potential for being exposed to NBC agents.  Desired characteristics include the following:
General Characteristics:  The ECU is intended to be used to provide space cooling and heating for military tents and shelters.  It will be a packaged unitary design, using ruggedized packaging, with duct collars for use with round flexible ducting.  It shall use non-ozone depleting refrigerant (ODP=0).  The refrigerant used shall have an ASHRAE 34 Safety Classification Rating of A2 or A1.  It shall incorporate up-to-date technology and components, must be easily maintainable in the field.  It must contain safety circuits and controls to prevent catastrophic damage.   
Capacity:  The ECU shall have a cooling capacity within the range of 36,000 BTU/hr to 200,000 BTU/hr, with a Sensible Heat Ratio of 0.7 or higher.  The capacity shall be rated using American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard 37, "Methods of Testing for Rating Unitary Air Conditioners and Heat Pump Equipment" using the following test conditions: Outdoor Dry Bulb Temperature: 125F, Indoor Dry Bulb Temperature: 90F, Indoor Wet Bulb Temperature: 75F; and operating with a pressure differential across the evaporator section supply and return of 0.5 inwg.  Results from testing at other rating conditions may be included in responses.  The ECU may include a heating capability, which will be verified IAW ANSI/ASHRAE 45 "Methods of Testing for Rating Non-Residential Warm Air Heaters", at the ambient temperature of 50F.
Operating Environment:  It is desired that the ECU be capable of providing cooling and heating over a wide variety of environmental conditions, including temperatures from -25F to 131F.  The ECU shall provide cooling in ambient temperature conditions up to 131F, with a 90F evaporator air inlet temperature.  
Power Input:  It is desired that the ECU operate from a 208 volt, 50/60 Hz, 3 phase power source. The minimum power factor is 0.85.  
Collective Protection:  The ECU shall be designed so that it prevents contamination of the conditioned air when operating as a support element to a Chemical/Biological Agent Protection system.  The COL PRO ECU is not intended to serve as a primary NBC filter though it may contain an internal filter to prevent contamination of the conditioned air if necessary.  The COL PRO ECU system will provide a protection factor (PF) of at least 6667 as determined by appropriate vapor challenge test.  Protection Factor is calculated as a ratio of the exterior (challenge) dosage to the resultant interior dosage. The COL PRO ECU shall be compatible with standard chemical protection equipment and operation in contaminated areas.  
Commercial firms possessing the characteristics noted in any of the above systems are encouraged and invited to submit product brochures and pricing materials outlining specifications, to include a statement of capabilities. Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only at the current stage.

The specifications to which TCS SwiftLink communication systems are manufactured are unique in the market and are proprietary to TCS, which is the original manufacturer of this product line. The deployable telecommunication system provided by TSC is a one of a kind solution for portable communication systems tailored to meet White House Communications Agency requirements for communications support for the POTUS and subsequently, Combatant Commanders. TCS offers its products to the US Government at a significantly reduced rate compared to their commercial pricing and does not use distributors or channel partners. TCS's products must be maintained by TCS to avoid voiding warranty. The required maintenance contract requires renewal to preclude adverse impact to military readiness. Any substitution in service could result in a degradation of operational and intelligence capability. This places American SOF soldiers at unnecessary risk, possibly resulting in death.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop to discuss innovative research that will investigate the way that nature may be exploiting quantum mechanical effects in biological systems.

Manifestly quantum effects have been postulated to have roles in a number of biological systems.  Recently experimental results have demonstrated long-lived quantum coherence in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) Bacteriochlorophyll complex (Nature 446, (2007), 782) and in the purple bacteria reaction center (Science, 316, (2007), 1462).  Furthermore, a quantum algorithm at work in the FMO complex which could have profound implications in the quantum information field.  In addition there may be other examples of quantum effects.  For example, new experimental results have led to the postulate that the magnetic navigation ability of some species of birds is due to the quantum Zeno effect in a photo-responsive protein complex.  

The DARPA QuBE Workshop will be held in the offices of Booz Allen Hamilton at 3811 N. Fairfax Dr., Suite 1000, Arlington, VA, 22203.  The ultimate goal of the workshop is to identify model biological systems and quantum effects for study, and to recommend research directions that would clarify the nature and potential impact of these effects.  The success of this workshop will rely heavily on group discussion of the research challenges across this interdisciplinary topic; as such, it is expected that participants will have relevant research experience.

The workshop will take place on September 29, 2008 between 1:00-7:00 PM, and September 30, 2008 between 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM. Sign-in and badging will take place on 29 September only; any participants who are not planning to attend the first day of the workshop must notify the organizers in advance.

There is no fee for the QuBE Workshop. Details on the workshop, including registration information, can be found at the following URL: https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=QUA47573, conference code QUA47573.

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 35 people, maximum 2 from each institution).  The registration cutoff date is September 26, 2008, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted additional participants on a first-come, first-serve basis.  Further administrative information is available from Ms. Jennifer Thabet (thabet.jennifer@bah.com).  Additional technical information can be obtained from Dr. Matthew Goodman (Matthew.Goodman@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the QuBE Workshop in any correspondence.  This special announcement is not a request for proposals.

<DESC>          The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to modify an existing contract (EPD04006) with Industrial Economics, Incorporated (IEc), Cambridge, Ma., which was awarded on a competitive basis.  This level of effort, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is in its final option period which expires September 30, 2008.  The modification will extend the current  period of performance through March 31, 2009 for an estimated increase in level of effort of 5,250 hours. 

          IEc has provided support to the Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), including the Immediate Office of the Assistant Administrator (IO) and the Office of Policy Analysis and Review (OPAR), responding to short-term analytical and logistical needs and to longer-term analyses and assessment needs.  Short term analyses, conducted within a week to several months, are regularly needed to examine existing and prospective legislation, regulations, treaties, and other policy instruments as they relate to the energy, economic and environmental effects of air and radiation protection programs.  Logistical support is also needed in developing tools, materials, and forums to communicate the potential effects of changes in government policy and to facilitate communication and potential resolution of issues identified by competing stakeholders.  These analyses, communication, and consultation efforts are often conducted in response to inquiries from Congress, the Executive Branch, industry and the public, and are often performed within discrete windows of time during rule-making or legislative processes.  As the policy landscape is continually evolving, OAR/IOs and OAR/OPARs specific short-term analytical and logistical needs are difficult to forecast, but often emerge out of existing policy debates and build upon past analyses.  

Over the longer term, OAR is responsible for a number of multi-year or periodic assessments requiring multi-disciplinary expertise and cross-disciplinary integration applied in the context of policy and program assessment, as well as logistical needs related to on-going stakeholder consultation and advisory processes.  These longer-term analyses and consultative processes also serve the needs of the Agency, Congress, and other decision makers charged with evaluating national and international air and radiation related policies and programs.  One example of a longer term analytical need is the periodic assessment of the costs and benefits of the Clean Air Act and its amendments and associated regulations mandated by Section 812 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  Currently, IEc is assisting EPA with the second prospective 812 study, which began in 2003 and has been the subject of ongoing consultation with the EPAs Scientific Advisory Boards Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis (referred to as the 812 Council).  The periodic meetings of the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council is an example of on-going logistical support needed.  

In helping to meet these short-term and long-term analytical needs, IEc has provided OAR (IO and OPAR) with expertise related to economic analysis.  IEc economic analysis has supported the ongoing second prospective 812 study; the development of policies related to carbon capture and storage; the assessment of the impacts of climate change and climate change policies; and rulemaking on flexible permitting, air toxics control standards, and revisions of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and lead.  IEc has also provided logistical support for consultations related to environmental justice and air toxics control.  

IEcs economic analysis is central to the on-going 812 study and to addressing many of the short-term policy-related analysis needs of OAR (IO and OPAR).  Without economic analysis expertise at its disposal, OAR will not have the ability to effectively respond to and shape policy developments and to maintain continuity and efficient progress with respect to longer term responsibilities.  Thus, IEcs continuing work on this project is critical to the Agencys mission.  

           It is essential to have access to analytical and logistical support, including economic analysis expertise, to be able to respond to the analytical and logistical needs of the administration transition.  OAR must also continue to make progress on the longer-term assessments, such as the Congressionally-mandated second prospective 812 study in a cost-effective manner.

          Interruption or delay of services would cause harm to the Government by not providing timely technical support.  The need for analysis or support for a consultative process tends to arise quickly and must be addressed within a short window of time before the opportunity to affect policy development has passed.  Some of these short term needs arise from the rule-making process which is often dictated by statutory or court ordered deadlines.  To provide timely technical support, the contractor must have prior working knowledge of the policy issues facing OAR and the appropriate methodologies to use in evaluating their environmental and economic impacts as most issues emerge out of existing policy debates and build upon past analyses.  The incumbent contractor has the knowledge and "know-how" to continue working with the on-going work without extensive transition, training, and start-up period.  It is not practicable for the Government to substitute a replacement contractor during the extended period due to the limited time work is needed and the Government's need to meet Agency requirements in a timely manner.  The work to be completed during this time period requires the same expertise and qualifications as is currently required to perform the work assignments under the contract.  Therefore, based on IEc's  unique knowledge and experience, it  is believed that IEc is the only contractor that has the ability to continue the critical analytical and logistical support to EPA within the necessary time frame for these activities that require quick responses.  It is, therefore, in the Agencys best interest to obtain the services of IEc on a sole source basis by extending the current period of performance of this contract for a period of 6 months with an estimated increase in level of effort of 5,250 hours.  The place of performance is at the contractor's site. 

          Interested parties who believe they can provide the required services are invited to submit, in writing, a response demonstrating an ability to immediately assume the on-going projects without disruption to the current operations and demonstrating a cost benefit to the Government in view of the short period of performance.  Any written response must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  In order to be considered responsive, the correspondence must be accompanied by a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bonafide capability to meet the Government's needs.  Responses without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.

<p>Note: FAR 52.232-18 applies to this solicitation and procurement. Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excerpt from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and Approval.</p>
<p>Websense is used on the USSOCOM enterprise wide area network as well as the USSOCOM Strategic Entry Points (SSEP). USSOCOM depends on Websense to provide web filtering in our compliance layer of defense and to protect USSOCOM networks against both malicious code and cyber attacks via the internet. Websense is used to meet the needs of approximately 8,500 global users. USSOCOM has used Websense for several years; it is a certified software product for internet monitoring and access control that meets the requirements of USSOCOM and the standards of DoDI 8500.2. Without this capability, USSOCOM will not be able to effectively protect the networks being used to support the global war on terrorism (GWOT); it would greatly increase network vulnerability with a corresponding increase in opportunity for exploiting the DoD global information grid. Websense Security Suite software has a unique central policy distribution. It allows for simultaneous policy distribution to multiple servers without the need to manually recreate policies for each server. Websense allows organizations to establish flexible internet use policies. The user can block unwanted malicious code and web sites by bandwidth or file type. Websense also has options for filtering web sites based on the time of day. Websense is also the only known product that can provide all capabilities to support the magnitude of the SOCOM network traffic and the diversity of the users that must be monitored and defended. The main requirement not met by other vendors is the requirement to scale to provide services for 8,500 users. No other software is available that has all the capabilities of the Websense software and can support all 8,500 USSOCOM personnel.</p>
<p>The Websense technology currently in place provides USSOCOM the ability to provide a Computer Network Defense posture directed by CJCSI 6510.01D. Award for a product other than Websense will significantly impact manpower and the resources required to bring USSOCOM personnel to the level of acceptable operational readiness required to meet mission demands. The impact must be considered before an award is made for a product other than Websense. There are also tremendous costs associated with risk to our data and SOF warriors as well as downtime of operational capability related to conversion to an alternate product. Those costs cannot be quantified in a monetary amount. The loss of forensic and recovery capability could allow malicious code, i.e. Trojans, viruses, etc. to be embedded in data residing on our network and enable potential propagation across the DoD unclassified networks causing further loss of data and services. USSOCOM would lose overall visibility of potential risks as well as the ability to quickly remove and sanitize data that could be accessed by unauthorized personnel to initiate malicious actions against USSOCOM networks. This kind of activity poses additional risks to SOF missions worldwide. Additionally, the learning curve associated with transition to a new tool is tremendous. Despite contractor training, it takes a significant amount of time for the technicians to become familiar with the tool, its capabilities, and be able to provide useful information to senior leaders for decision making. Although other software tools exist on the market, none have the ability to provide the level of protection and service for the size, diversity, and volume of data processed by USSOCOM on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In addition, Websense has a unique central policy distribution. It allows for simultaneous policy distribution to multiple servers without the need to manually recreate policies for each server. Websense is also the only known product that can provide all capabilities to support the magnitude of the SOCOM network traffic and the diversity of the users that must be monitored and defended The main requirement not met by other vendors is the requirement to scale to provide services for 8,500 users.</p>
<p><br />To award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government not expected to be recovered through full and open competition. Without this brand name procurement, the approximate cost of the duplication effort would be approximately $504,673.00, as well as downtime and loss of resources not expected to be recovered through full and open competition. These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that have been incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for its contractors and employees as well as the cost of replacing existing capability to insure interoperability and eliminate continued need to train for separate systems.</p>
<p>The costs not recovered through full and open competition involve resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated with downtime and lack of coverage during the replacement phase of new technology.</p>

Proposal Evaluation

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.  In addition to price, when determining best value, the NLRB will consider the proposed approach to performing Audio and Web Conferencing Services, with appropriate consideration given to the following three evaluation factors:

	Factor 1.  Technical
	Factor 2.  Past Performance
	Factor 3.  Price

Relative importance of the factors, in that, the Technical and Past Performance are equal in importance and both are slightly more important than the Price factor.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than Acceptable must be achieved for all the factors.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor with lowest cost.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions with one or more contractors and request revised proposals.  

FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL. 

Technical approach will be evaluated based on the extent to which the contractor concisely and accurately discusses the nature of the services being requested.

a. Technical Excellence  The degree in which the contractor understands the technical requirements of the proposed contract; that the contractor thoroughly understands the technical requirements of audio and web conference bridging. 


FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE

Past performance shall be evaluated on a measure of the Governments confidence in the Contractors ability to successfully perform and meet the objective, based on relevant contracts the Contractor has undertaken within the last 5 years of similar size and scope.  The following sub-factors will be evaluated: 

a. Quality of Product or Service  The degree to which the Contractor can show the ability to meet all service level agreements and ensure customer satisfaction.

b. Timeliness of Performance  The degree in which the Contractor meets established schedules or milestones. The Contractor will describe how it will staff the requirements throughout the life of the contract.

c. Business Relations  The degree in which the Contractor has the ability to maintain a professional working relationship with government staff, be up front with controversial issues even if they are viewed negatively and maintain a high degree of honesty and integrity.

In the case of a contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Contractor will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

FACTOR 3:   PRICE Price will be evaluated based on competition, and information supplied in each proposal.  In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the proposed line items or bottom line price is significantly unbalanced or unjustified.  The determination of Best Value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the non-pricing factors with the differences in the discounted prices proposed.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical performance than in lowest overall price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only a slightly superior technical performance.  Overall price may be more significant as proposals are determined to be equal based on other non price factors.

_____DESCRIPTION:
I.	GENERAL
BACKGROUND
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.  
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION
-	Contractor personnel are expected to perform service during normal business hours. Normal business hours are 9:00 AM  5:30 PM.

&#61607;	Install, repair or replace common equipment in the phone closet.

The period of performance will be from October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009
Option 1 will be from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010.
_____EVALUATION. The Government intends to award multiple contracts to the responsible offerors whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government and represents the best value, price and other factors considered.  Offerors shall ensure they indicate which locations they are bidding on and provide separate pricing for each location.  Do not merely state $25 for each service call, when you are proposing pricing for several regional or residential offices.  Submit a separate cost proposal for each location.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical capability, past performance, and price/cost.  Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price/cost. 
The award will be made based on the best overall (i.e., best value) proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government and the proposed approach to performing telephone maintenance, with appropriate consideration given to the three evaluation factors:

	Factor 1.  Technical
	Factor 2.  Past Performance
	Factor 3.  Price

Relative importance of the factors, in that, the Technical factor is significantly more important than the Past Performance factor, which is slightly more important than the Price factor. The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than Acceptable must be achieved for all the factors.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor with lowest cost.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award the delivery order on initial quotes, without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions with one or more contractors and request revised proposals.  

FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL. 

Technical approach will be evaluated based on the extent to which the contractor concisely and accurately discusses the nature of the services being requested

a.	Technical Excellence  The degree in which the contractor understands the technical requirements of the proposed contract.  

b. Personnel Qualifications  Contractor shall propose personnel requirements and qualifications, including key personnel and submit resumes for the key personnel.  In addition, the contractor shall provide letters of commitment or letters of intent for the key personnel. The resumes shall describe the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed key personnel.


FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE

Past performance shall be evaluated on a measure of the Governments confidence in the Contractors ability to successfully perform and meet the objective, based on relevant contracts the Contractor has undertaken within the last 3 years of similar size and scope.  The following sub-factors will be evaluated: 

a.Quality of Product or Service  The degree to which the Contractor can show the ability to meet all service level agreements and ensure customer satisfaction.

b.Timeliness of Performance  The degree in which the Contractor meets established schedules or milestones. The Contractor will describe how it will staff the requirements throughout the life of the contract.

c.Cost Control  The degree in which the Contractor completes repairs within the established time period.

d.Business Relations  The degree in which the Contractor has the ability to maintain a professional working relationship with government staff, be up front with controversial issues even if they are viewed negatively and maintain a high degree of honesty and integrity.

In the case of an contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Contractor will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
FACTOR 3:   PRICE Price will be evaluated based on competition and information supplied in each proposal.  In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the proposed line items or bottom line price is significantly unbalanced or unjustified.  The determination of Best Value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the non-pricing factors with the differences in the discounted prices proposed.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical performance than in lowest overall price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only a slightly superior technical performance.  Overall price may be more significant as proposals are determined to be equal based on other non price factors.

<DESC>Secure Courier Services 
Solicitation Number: TIRNO-08-R-00017

Description	

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (services) prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP); solicitation number is TIRNO-08-R-00017, and a firm fixed price contract is contemplated.  This is a service contract and service contract wage rates apply.  Wage determinations under the Service Contract Act can be downloaded from the following website: www.wdol.gov.  Relevant Wage Determinations for all geographic areas serviced by any contracts resulting from this solicitation will apply.  Applicable Wage Determinations for locations and classes of service employees proposed will be incorporated into all contracts resulting from this solicitation.  This Service Contract base period shall be for twelve (12) months. In this solicitation document, the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24 effective 28 February 2008.  The North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) is 561613 Armored Car Services.  This procurement is unrestricted.

All responsible business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The Internal Revenue Service has a requirement to procure the following:

Background

The Internal Revenue Service intends to purchase secure courier services for the pickup and delivery of cash tax payments.  There are currently 177 IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) located throughout the United States.  Each business day, the cash funds collected from tax payments must be safely transported to a designated financial institution. Currently, there is no uniform system for safely handling and delivering these funds.  

Objectives

The goal of this procurement is to establish a safe and uniform process for delivering cash from IRS TACs to TGA banks/cash vaults (see attached List).  The use of secure courier services will enable the funds to be safely transferred and accounted for.  Because there are 177 centers located throughout the country, it is imperative that the vendors selected for contract awards be able to cover all of the tax centers on a nationwide basis.  In order to create an effective process for the transfer of these funds, the successful vendors shall collectively be able to supply secure courier services for all given locations.  The number of awards will be determined by the regional coverage and pricing proposed by the offerors.

NOTE:  While there are 177 TAC sites overall, ten (10) of these sites have been identified as priority requirements and will be temporarily serviced by other means.  For the purposes of the contract(s) resulting from this solicitation, ALL TAC sites should be priced.  The 10 priority sites will be awarded as optional contract line items (CLINs) for the base award period, with the expectation that they will be added to the base period during FY 09.  All of the 177 TAC sites will be included as CLINs in Option Year Periods 1 through 4.  By including these 10 additional/priority TACs in this way, pricing will be predetermined when the need arises to add these TACs as active pickup sites at some point in the future. 
The secure courier service will pick up cash receipts and the deposit form (Form 10160  see attached) at the TAC by close of business, Monday through Friday (excluding Federal Holidays: New Years Day; Martin Luther King Jr. Day; Washingtons Birthday; Memorial Day; Independence Day; Labor Day; Columbus Day; Veterans Day; Thanksgiving Day; Christmas Day.  The shipments will be picked up from:
(TAC Address  See Attached Spreadsheet)

And delivered to a TGA bank/cash vault in sufficient time to allow for same day credit:

			(TGA Banks/Cash Vaults See Attached List)

Form 10160 (see attached) will accompany all courier pickup bags.  The courier will have the Form signed and dated at the cash vault at the time of deposit.  The signed and dated Form 10160 will be given to the IRS at the time of the next pickup at the IRS location.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
	a) The Government will award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror or offerors whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   

1) Ability to meet Tasks/Requirements/Deliverables outlined in the Solicitation  
2) Geographical Area(s) covered, number of locations proposed
3) Ability to pick up receipts from the TACs before close of business each day and to comply with same day deposit requirement
4) Security of services provided 
5) Proper bonding/licensing/insurance 
6) Experience
7) Past Performance
8) Pricing

The factors above are listed in order of importance. Technical Factors one (1) through six (6) and past performance are more important, when combined, compared to Price.  The importance of price will increase as the difference in technical comparisons decreases.  Award(s) will be made relative to best overall value to the Government.  Offers must meet all minimum qualifications, but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.  Notwithstanding that technical capability and past performance are more importance than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.  

Offerors shall provide a minimum of three references with name of company, point of contact, and phone number for past performance.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.
  
	b) Options  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine than an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

	c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offers specified time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</strong><br /><br />A. Award. Contract award will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is compliant with the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, cost and non-cost factors considered. The following evaluation factors and subfactors will form the basis for award and are listed in descending order of importance:<br /><br />Factor A: Past Performance<br />Factor B: Experience<br />Subfactor 1 Technical Capability <br />Factor C: Cost<br /><br /><br />The only way to correct a deficiency would be through discussions (see FAR 15.306(d). HOWEVER, WE INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS, AS PERMITTED BY FAR 15.306(a) AND CLAUSE 52.215-1</p>
<p>B. Evaluation Criteria.<br /><br />FACTOR A: PAST PERFORMANCE: Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror has satisfied its customers in the past, and complied with Federal, state and local laws and regulations. Assessment of each offeror's past performance will be based mainly on reputation with customers and others. This evaluation is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officer's responsibility determination. The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to successfully meet requirements of the RFP. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.<br /><br /><br />Evaluator's will contact some or all of an offeror's customers and others, including, but not limited to, Federal, state, and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases. Contacts will be asked the following:<br /><br />(1) Whether or not they believe that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective;<br /><br />(2) Whether the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of the contract;<br /><br />(3) Whether the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and<br /><br />(4) Whether the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.<br /><br />(5) Whether the offeror's performance is devoid of wage and hour issues, complaints, and/or investigations.<br /><br />Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for past performance. However, an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous offer to the Government and thus may be an unsuccessful offeror when compared to other offerors. Offerors will be required to submit Past Performance information as requested or an offeror must affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant, directly related, or similar past performance. <br /><br />FACTOR B: EXPERIENCE: The following subfactors are listed in descending order of importance and will be considered in the evaluation of the technical proposals. Each offeror will be required to provide the information associated with the subfactor listed.</p>
<p>SUBFACTOR 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: Offerors will be evaluated based on the following technical capabilities:<br /><br />a. Proven capabilities and experience in performing services. And other examples applicable to the work described in the Statement of Work, in the RFP..<br /><br /><br />FACTOR C: Price: The Government will use the total evaluated price method for evaluation purposes, including options. Price may be the deciding factor for selection, depending upon whether a highly evaluated technical proposal warrants the evaluated cost differential.<br /><br />All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The degree of importance of cost increases with the degree of equality of the proposals or when the cost is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government. All offers shall be evaluated against the established standards set forth herein.<br /></p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Newport Corporation, Irvine, California.  The requirement is for five VH Workstations 36 x 48, #VH3648W-OPT with the following configuration: 29 breadboard scientific GR4; 01 Frame Assy w/Isolators; 01 Support Rail Assy 36x48; 01 Kit, castor, VH White; 02 Shelf Table top 10x36; 01 cable management assy including rigging and shipping charges.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41U.S.C. 253 (3)(1), FAR 13.106-1(2)(b).   The cited authority is applicable because the Newport Corporation is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  The vibration dampening tables included in this order will be used with highly vibration sensitive, computer-aided quantitative morphometry equipment, including a Zeiss 710 laser scanning microscope.  Newport Corporation is the industry leader in vibration control technology and provides vibration dampening capacity substantially exceeding their competitors.  Previous testing of products from other companies at the Biomedical Research Center, NIA have failed to provide adequate vibration control.  In addition, Zeiss will only guarantee that their equipment will perform within specifications when used in conjunction with the quoted tables from Newport.    Estimated delivery date is 4 weeks.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price, technically acceptable source.

<p>It is anticipated that a firm fixed price contract will be issued for this requirement. All Contract Line Items (CLIN's) must be offered on to be considered for award. Award will go to the responsive, responsible small business concern who offers the lowest cumulative price  and conforms to the requirements contained herein. Prices are being sought for two (2) different types of Electromechanical Cable  (CLIN's 0001 and 0002) . The offeror shall provide a firm fixed price quote for one (1) quantity for CLIN 0001 and two (2) quantity for CLIN 0002. Quotations shall be firm fixed price offers for the following:</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 0001 (Quantity One (1) 0.322" Electromechanical Cable): Introduction:</strong> The Pacific Marine Center uses electromechanical cable to lower various scientific instruments over the side of their oceangoing research vessels.  The cables support the instruments and provide the means for electrical signals to pass between the instruments and the vessel.  It is typically called "CTD wire".The following specifications describe the significant characteristics the cable design must have.  General: An electromechanical cable is required to lower various scientific instruments over the side of an oceangoing research vessel.  The cable shall be capable of safely lowering an instrument to 6,000 m water depth in the dynamic environment caused by ship and wave motion, and lowering/raising speeds of 70 m/min.  Multiple conductors are required for the real time transmission of electrical data and control signals and for redundancy.  The cable shall be capable of being stored under tension for five years on single drum winches to multiple layers.  Resistance to crushing is required.  It is expected that payloads will frequently produce loading of the cable (both static + dynamic) approaching 50% of rated breaking strength&yuml;(RBS). The cable will be used with LEBUS grooved drum shell.  The cable must be compatible with existing LEBUS grooved shells for a Markey DESH-5, 38" width drum. <strong>Characteristics: 1) </strong>Maximum strength attainable is identified as the best possible ratio of strength to weight.  The ability of a cable to "survive" under extreme conditions is a function of its Rated or Ultimate Breaking Strain.  Minimum breaking strength is 10,000 lbs, free end <strong>2)</strong> Highest elastic limit attainable -- identified as the best possible ratio of elastic limit to weight.  This characteristic controls the mix of payload size, wire out, wire speed and environmental conditions at which the cable can operate with safety.  This applies to both strength and electrical components of the cable.  Elongation of no greater than 1.0 ft/kft/klbf.<strong> 3)</strong> High rotational stability is identified as a minimal amount of axial rotation under loads cyclically varying from 0% to 45% of RBS.  Low rotation is considered necessary to avoid looping/hockling the cable on bottom contact or "Zero" tension conditions and to prevent excessive spinning of lowered instruments.  Maximum amount acceptable is 15 degrees/ft. <strong>4) </strong>High degree of armor stress balance is identified as the absence or near absence of variations to the relative loading on inner and outer armors that produce strength degradation when one end of the cable is free to rotate. <strong>5)</strong> Minimum service life of 5 years.  <strong>6) </strong>Cable shall be capable of operating at: greater than 30% RBS for 90% of expected life and greater than 40% RBS for 70% of expected life. <strong>7)</strong> The cable shall be able to withstand occasional loading to 50% RBS without reduction in strength or change in electrical characteristics. <strong>8) </strong>The armor shall be galvanized. <strong>9)</strong> The cable shall have a finished O.D. of 8.1788 mm (0.322"). <strong>10)</strong> The cable shall be in  one  unbroken length of 8000 m (without splices).  <strong>11)</strong> The cable shall be capable of operation with single drum winch systems where the cable is stored under tension. <strong>12) </strong>The cable shall be able to operate continuously (useful life) over sheaves not less than (NLT) 40 times the cable diameter without degradation in strength.  <strong>13)</strong> The cable must be capable of withstanding repeated flexures over sheaves at the nominal working loads given in item 6 without degradation in strength or change in electrical characteristics. <strong>14) </strong>The cable shall be capable of withstanding cyclical loading in tension as results from ship motion without degradation in strength or change in electrical characteristics. <strong>15) </strong>The cable shall not unlay when cut, i.e. it must be well preformed. <strong>16) </strong>The cable shall be lubricated for abrasion and corrosion protection.  The lubricant should not extrude in use and be of non-petroleum base. <strong>17)</strong> The cable shall have multiple electrical conductors capable of efficient transmission of low power signals at frequencies less than 20 kHz.  Cable design should be optimized to permit simultaneous transmission of 5 kHz and 10 kHz signals in a single conductor to armor circuit.  <strong>Performance Specifications: 1) </strong>Finished Diameter: - The finished diameter shall be 8.1788 mm (0.322") at a loading of 15% of RBS.  The diameter shall be uniform over the length of the cable with tolerances of (&Auml;0.0508 mm (0.002") and +0.076 mm (0.003")). <strong>2) </strong>Working Diameter: - The change in cable diameter due to a change in cable loading shall not exceed 2% of the finish diameter.  At a loading of 50% RBS the cable diameter shall not be less than 8.03 mm (0.316)".   <strong>3)</strong> Rotation: - The finished cable should not rotate about its axis more than 65 degrees per meter at 40% of RBS.  It is recognized that this requirement may not be met given the specified outer armor wire size and minimum sheave diameter. <strong>4)</strong> Rated Breaking Strength: 4500 Kg (10000 lbs) with one end free to rotate.  <strong>5)</strong> Flexure Tolerance: - Withstand &gt; 50,000 flexure cycles over sheaves 40 times wire O.D. at 35-40% of RBS without failure of individual wires or degradation of electrical performance.  Degradation in strength shall not exceed 5% of RBS.  <strong>6)</strong> Tension Cycling: - Withstand &gt; 50,000 cycles in tension from 10% to 40% of RBS at an 8 sec. period without failure of individual wires or degradation of electrical performance.  Degradation in strength shall not exceed 5% of RBS.  <strong>7)</strong> Sheave Size: - The cable shall be capable of operation with sheaves of tread diameter 38 cm (15"). <strong>8) </strong>Cable Length: - The cable shall of an unbroken lengths of 8,050 m without splices.  <strong>9)</strong> Armor Wires: - The armor wires shall be galvanized and have the following characteristics: Tensile Strength: greater than Extra Improved Plow Steel; Ductility:	greater than of XIPS; Armor: both inner and outer armor wires to have a diameter greater than  0.813 mm (0.032") SGXXIPS <strong>10) </strong>Belt: - The conductor package shall be jacketed with 0.381 mm (0.015") Hytrel to protect the conductors from armor abrasion.  <strong>11)</strong> Electrical: - The cable shall be constructed with 3 stranded copper wire conductors sized #20 AWG or larger, #19 AWG 19/0.203 mm (0.008") bare copper with 0.406 mm (0.016") wall polypropylene, each of which shall have the following electrical characteristics: Conductor Resistance: greater than 32.8 ohms/1000 m.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-09 and DFARS Change Notice 20020730.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511 and small business size standard is $23.0 Million.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR), Director of Technology Transition (Code 03T) manages the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR), Manufacturing Technology, Transition Initiatives, Commercial Tech Transfer, and Rapid Technology Transition programs and coordinates the technology readiness assessments thru the technical departments as appropriate.  In addition, the Director of Technology Transition (Code 03T) serves as the senior advocate for the movement of commercial/industrial technology, identifying emerging technologies of interest to the Department of the Navy (DON) and mediating the transition of technology between the provider and the acquisition program.  The role of ONR Code 03T is to foster an environment for collaborative sharing of emerging technology innovations in which to pursue those Navy/ONR laboratory technologies that might have commercial potential.  Code 03T requires the capability to reach out to the commercial and academic community to explore and take advantage of marketplace opportunities.  The ONR Navy Technology Transfer Program Office (Code 03TSB) wishes to explore possible commercial available solutions, tools and training targeted to publicizing the commercial viability of Navy developed technologies.  This effort is set up a pilot demonstration to test the feasibility of a Portfolio Commercialization Review Service in order to discover which Navy/ONR laboratory technologies have commercial potential.  The purpose of this effort is to provide a web-based (on-line) Portfolio Commercialization Review Service in order to discover which Navy developed laboratory technologies have commercial potential and to survey the target market and identify exploitation opportunities.  This task will provide a fully functioning web-based solution and support a pilot to demonstrate the capability for Navy to reach out to the targeted market place to determine if Navy developed technologies are commercially viable and find partnerships that will champion the exploitation of developed projects, to identify market information and out-licensing opportunities for the technologies with commercial potential.   Code 03TSB wishes to conduct a pilot project at eleven (11) Laboratory facilities to exploit emerging Navy technologies for commercialization by using targeted marketing of technology.  Code 03TSB requires a comprehensive solution for target marketing of technology that will identify, analyze, and comprehend the focused market for developed technologies.  The Office of Naval Research requires a means to discover the commercialization of emerging Navy developed technologies through focused target marketing, finding partners who are interested in, and ready to take the technology to market.  The contractor will be required to provide coaching, mentoring, and training support (on-site and on-line) to teams of Navy technology transfer staff and interns as may be appropriate so that the teams may address at least six technologies or technology portfolios over the course of one year or twelve (12) months.  To enable the Navy teams to collaborate with each other and facilitate the process implementation, the contractor shall provide up to three (3) days of formal web based training at the contractors facility or at the Office of Naval Research located at 875 North Randolph Street, Arlington VA.  The location of the training is at the discretion of the Program Officer.

D. INTRODUCTION: 

Incumbent serves the Senior Democracy Advisor for the USAID mission in Paraguay. In this position he/she directs the democracy and governance office, serves as senior democracy advisor to senior mission management and the US Ambassador, oversees all assistance in the governing democratically and justly (GDJ) area, and activities under the USAID-managed MCC Threshold Program.

GDJ is the US Missions highest priority under the Foreign Assistance Framework, and democracy has traditionally been the largest part, roughly 40 percent of the Missions portfolio, even without taking into account the DG and anti-corruption focus of the MCC Threshold Program.



Paraguay is a low-income, developing country located in the geographic center of South America.  The country has a nascent democracy, having endured a long succession of dictatorships until the overthrow of General Stroessner in 1989, 40 percent of its population live in poverty, and it faces a long litany of development challenges.  Perhaps most fundamental of these challenges is the systemic corruption that permeates all levels of political and economic life, and that has undermined the faith of Paraguay's citizens in democracy and the free market.  Symptomatic of the country's corruption problem is the notorious Tri-Border Area (TBA) of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina, a hub for international crime, including terrorism financing, drug and arms trafficking, and money laundering.  As the TBA's weak link, Paraguay is important to regional stability and security interests.

USAID/Paraguay administers programs directed at the following primary objective areas of the State/USAID Foreign Assistance framework -- Governing Democratically and Justly (including rule of law, civil society, and local government); Economic Growth (trade development, environment); and in Investing in People (health systems and services and family planning).   USAID/Paraguay also manages a $35 million Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Threshold Country Program focused on anti-corruption through institution building, the reduction of impunity, and the promotion of economic formalization.   While the Threshold Program is due to be completed in November, 2008, Paraguay has been invited by the MCC to submit a proposal this year to continue Threshold Program assistance for new funding, estimated at $30-35 million, and an additional two years.

Important political context for the USAID program and this position in particular are the results of recent presidential and congressional elections held in April 2008, in which an ex Roman Catholic Bishop won a convincing victory at the ballot box.   The victory of Mr. Lugo and his broad opposition alliance marks the end of over 60 years of one-party hegemony in Paraguay.   The President-elect and the new administration took office in August 2008 for a five-year term.  As a recognized lead donor in the governance area in Paraguay, USAID expects to have a key role in assisting the new Government implement an ambitious reform agenda.    

The Senior Democracy Advisor is the Chief of the USAID/Paraguay Democracy and Governance Office, consisting of 9 FSN employees who manage activities in Democracy and Governance, including rule of law, civil society, local government, and the USAID/MCC Threshold Program.  

As the senior democracy and governance advisor, the Senior Democracy Advisor represents USAID on the US Embassy Law Enforcement Working Group and coordinates closely USAID activities with other USG efforts related to democracy/governance and anti-corruption.  The Senior Democracy Advisor reports to the Mission Director.   

The Senior Democracy Advisor will have signing authority for the Global Simplified Acquisition System (GLAS) for non-expendable and expendable purchases, and services contracts for USAID Paraguay.  



The Senior Democracy Advisors responsibilities at USAID/Paraguay encompass the full range of management and support activities at a small field mission including personnel supervision, formulation of project and program support budgets, program assistance planning and management related functions unique to overseas operations. The role of the Senior Democracy Advisor is vital and essential to facilitate the delivery of foreign assistance in Paraguay.

1.0	INSTRUCTIONS

1.1	GSA will be accepting proposals to conduct Crucial Conversations Training Seminar to be held in Federal Way, WA.  The period for government acceptance of the quote is 30 days following the RFP due date. 

1.2	These services are being procured as a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP), using source selection procedures, as authorized by parts 12, 13 and/or 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the General Service Administration Acquisition Manual (GSAM) located at:  http://www.arnet.gov/far and http://www.arnet.gov/GSAM/gsam.html.  This solicitation will result in a best value, fixed price task order.  

1.3	GSA's objective is to select the proposal that offers the Best Value.  Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  It is advised that firms submit an offer that represents the firms best terms from a price and technical standpoint since the Government intends to award this contract to the offeror possessing the overall best value to the government utilizing the tradeoff source selection process (FAR 15.101).  The evaluation factors are price, technical capability, and past performance (FAR 15.304).    

1.4	The government will evaluate the quality and extent of the offerors experience relevant to the requirements of this RFQ.  The government reserves the right to consider other sources of information such as current and past procurements, other federal agency contracts, commercial sources, and the Contractor Performance System.  The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirements, when such information is relevant to the acquisition.  

1.5	Interested firms are cautioned to submit adequate and sufficient information to enable the Government to fully ascertain its capability to perform all of the requirements of this acquisition.  The data submitted with each proposal should be complete and concise but not overly elaborate.  

1.6	The Government may make a final determination as to whether the offerors proposal is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal as submitted.  Accordingly, offerors are advised to submit initial proposals that are fully and clearly acceptable without additional information.  Offers which do not present sufficient information to permit a complete technical evaluation by the Government may be determined to be technically unacceptable.  

1.7	The Government reserves the right to limit, for purposes of efficiency, the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals (FAR 15.306).  

1.8	Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:  The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.  
 
2.0	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1	Submit your Technical Proposal to the GSA Linda Petorak, Purchasing Agent, via email to linda.petorak@gsa.gov, no later than Sept 12, 2008, 2:00 PM Pacific Time Zone.  The offerors name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, date of submission, and RFQ number shall appear on the cover letter to be evaluated.  
 
2.2	The Offeror shall submit their written technical and price proposal with the following table of contents: 
Cover Letter
SF Form 18, Request for Quotation
Technical Capability (no more than 5 pages)
Two Past Performance References

2.3	Technical Capability:  Technical Capability information must include information regarding the capability of the firm to conduct the training described in the scope of work for this project.  Suggested discussion points to demonstrate capability include descriptions of the firm, proposed training course outline, proposed instructor (include qualifications and number of years of experience).  The information reflected in the proposal is what will be evaluated.  Interested firms are discouraged from the expense of submitting high gloss, color pictures, and/or professionally written marketing material.  

2.6	Past Performance References:  Each offeror shall provide a list of no more than two (2) similar projects completed within the last three (3) years.  GSA defines similar projects as 2-day leadership development training courses for government agencies.  For each project listed, the offeror shall provide, at a minimum, the information shown in Attachment 3 (not to exceed one page).  GSA will contact the references provided for the projects submitted as similar past experience and will complete the past performance surveys.  Your firm will be rated on the following five categories:  quality of products or services, timeliness of performance, effectiveness of management and business relationships, overall rating, and customer satisfaction.  


3.0	TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

3.1	Technical proposals from offerors will be evaluated to determine if they meet the stated requirements.  

3.2	Award will be made based on the result of the evaluation of past performance, technical capability, and price.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. 



4.0	PRICE EVALUATION CRITERIA

4.1	Offeror shall submit pricing on the attached SF Form 18 and attach supporting documentation as described in the Notes.  The contents of the price proposal shall include a breakdown of a lump sum price for the training and a separate price for all associated travel costs. Travel costs shall not exceed the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) rates for the applicable geographical location.  

4.2	Offers will be evaluated on the basis of Price Reasonableness, given acceptance of the technical criteria cited above.  The government will compare the technical evaluation and the price proposal to determine the most advantageous combination.  Unrealistically low or high priced proposals, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.  

4.3	If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance rating and that offer represents the best value to the Government, the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that contractor without further consideration of any other offers.

5.0	DISCUSSIONS AND REVISIONS

5.1	Contractors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the instructions. Contractors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the contractor has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Government reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

5.2	The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions (negotiations) if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  If discussions are conducted, the means and methods (e.g., in person, telephonic, written) will be determined by the Contracting Officer.  This may result in a request for revised price.  If final proposal revisions will be required for award determination, at the direction of the Contracting Officer, the offeror shall then submit their Final Price Revision (FPR) for evaluation.  Final selection and award will be made by the Contracting Officer to that offeror that provides the best value to the Government.  GSA also reserves the right, however, to award without discussions.  

6.0	DEBRIEFINGS

6.1	Offerors not awarded a contract must request a debriefing, in writing via email to linda.petorak@gsa.gov, within three (3) days after the offeror has received notification of contract award.  Offerors are entitled to no more than one debriefing for each proposal.  If the offeror does not submit a timely request, GSA is not obligated to provide a debriefing. Debriefings will occur during GSA business hours (from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM, Pacific Time Zone, Monday through Friday with the exception of federal holidays).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

The award decision will be based on the BEST VALUE offered to the government and not solely on price.  Evaluation of Quotations:<BR>(a) The Government will issue an order from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:<BR><BR>Technical capability, past performance, and price.<BR><BR>(b) Provide the following information with your quote:<BR><BR>1.  Technical Capability:   Explain how your company will meet the service requirement identified in line items 0001, 0002 and 0003 above.<BR><BR> 2.  Past Performance.  Attached to this solicitation is a Past Performance Questionnaire to be completed by three customers of the same or similar products or services.  Vendors are responsible for ensuring completed questionnaires are submitted to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office by the RFQs closing date and time (see address and point of contact information at the end of this RFQ).<BR><BR> 3.  Price<BR><BR>(c)  Award will be on an all or none basis.  Vendors must submit their quotes by the due date and time below.  Quotes received at other than the stated address will not be considered for award.<BR><BR>Evaluation Process:  All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar service as well as Technical Capability.  Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2.  The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price related factors.  In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors.  3.  Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance.  Technical capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of the quotes are determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium.  The Trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror.  Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 with their offer.

Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.  Note 22 applies.<BR><BR>**Sole Source Justification<BR>1. Authority Cited:  This request is submitted in accordance with  10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)When supplies or services required by the agency are available form only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only on or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided.<BR>2.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Only one source is capable of responding to the unique or specialized nature of the work.  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) applies in this instance because there is no other recognized source that provides the support required to meet the mandate of NDAA 2008.  <BR>Sec 587 of NDAA 2008 indicates: <BR>In carrying out the demonstration projects, the Secretary of Defense may utilize a corporate services provider model. Employees of a provider under such a model shall include personnel who implement special educational and behavioral intervention plans for eligible dependents that are developed, reviewed, and maintained by supervisory level providers approved by the Secretary. In authorizing such a model, the Secretary shall establish<BR>(A) minimum education, training, and experience criteria required to be met by employees who provide services to eligible dependents;<BR><BR> (B) requirements for supervisory personnel and supervision, including requirements for supervisor credentials and for the frequency and intensity of supervision; and<BR> (C) such other requirements as the Secretary considers appropriate to ensure safety and the protection of the eligible dependents who receive services from such employees under the demonstration projects. <BR>To determine if the provider education, training, experience, supervision and competency requirements developed by TRICARE for the purpose of an autism services demonstration project meet adequate professional standards of quality, efficacy and safety.  The Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACA) is the only recognized entity that is qualified to make such a determination and support this requirement.<BR>The Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc. (BACB) is a nonprofit corporation established to meet professional credentialing needs identified by behavior analysts, governments, and consumers of behavior analysis services.  The BACB adheres to the national standards for boards that grant professional credentials. The BACB certification procedure undergoes regular psychometric review and validation, pursuant to a job analysis survey of the profession and standards established by content experts in the field. The BACBs mission is to develop, promote, and implement a national and international certification program for behavior analyst practitioners. The BACB has established uniform content, standards, and criteria for the credentialing process that are designed to meet <BR>1.	The legal standards established through state, federal and case law; <BR>2.	The accepted standards for national certification programs; and <BR>3.	The best practice and ethical standards of the behavior analysis profession.  <BR>The BACB program is based on the successful Behavior Analysis Certification Program developed by the State of Florida.  Similar programs were established in California, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York and Oklahoma.  After the inception of the BACB, all of these programs transferred their certificants and credentialing responsibilities to the BACB and closed. The Behavior Analyst Certification Board's BCBA and BCABA credentialing programs are accredited by the National Council for Certifying Agencies in Washington, DC.  The NCCA is the accreditation body of the National Organization for Competency Assurance.  The BACB is endorsed by the Association for Behavior Analysis International and Division 25 (Behavior Analysis) of the American Psychological Association.<BR>3.  Efforts to Obtain Competition.  The Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACB) is the only agency that performs the work that is required for this requirement.  A recent Google search confirmed that all other vendors that performed identical services to that of BACB, have since transferred their certifications and credentialing operations to BACB, and closed. Further, BACB is the only responsible vendor that can perform the tasks as outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW).<BR>4. Actions to Increase Competition:  The Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACA) is the only vendor available to provide the support/services requested for this requirement. However, through on-going market surveillance and additional research the Government will attempt to identify competitive substitutable services and will compete the requirements when competition is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government. <BR>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

	 1.5.1 Inside cabinet rack  (1) DVR or Server
	 
	The requirement for DVR or SERVER server would indicate that the system can be network based. 
	 
	 A vendor should be able to propose a solution that runs on its own independent network using standard network cabling and switches. By definition even a standard CCTV system runs on it's own independent coax network.
	 
	I believe the answer refers to the fact that the system can not run on or interfere with any Government or outside network.

<DESC>1.  During the question period that closed on May 30, 2008 one question was submitted. The question received was:
 
Q:  In your objectives you state there are 177 centers and it is required that the vendors selected be able to cover all of the centers on a nationwide basis.  Then later it in the same paragraph it says the number of awards will be determined by the regional coverage and pricing proposed by the vendors.
 
I am not sure what you are saying.  Are you saying that the vendor must be able to service all 177 locations or do you mean that you will be dividing the 177 locations into a number of regions?
 
If you are saying a vendor can bid a region, can you provide a list of regions with the centers in that region?

Answer:  While we have 177 centers nationwide that need coverage, it is not our expectation that any single firm will be able to provide coverage for all of these sites.  We will not be breaking the 177 locations in to regions or any other division/designation.  Our statement that the number of awards will be determined by the regional coverage and pricing proposed by the vendors reflects the fact that we expect that there will need to be more than one award to service all 177 locations, but until we receive proposals, we have no way to determine how many contracts will be required to provide coverage to all locations.  Offerors are encouraged to propose coverage for whatever sites they are able to service.

2.  The date for receipt of proposals has not been extended as a result of this amendment.  All terms and conditions remain the same as stated in the original solicitation.

Solicitation Number: TIRNO-08-R-00017/Amendment 0003

Description	

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (services) prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP); solicitation number is TIRNO-08-R-00017, and a firm fixed price contract is contemplated.  This is a service contract and service contract wage rates apply.  Wage determinations under the Service Contract Act can be downloaded from the following website: www.wdol.gov.  Relevant Wage Determinations for all geographic areas serviced by any contracts resulting from this solicitation will apply.  Applicable Wage Determinations for locations and classes of service employees proposed will be incorporated into all contracts resulting from this solicitation.  This Service Contract base period shall be for twelve (12) months. In this solicitation document, the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24 effective 28 February 2008.  The North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) is 561613 Armored Car Services.  This procurement is unrestricted.

All responsible business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The Internal Revenue Service has a requirement to procure the following:

Background

The Internal Revenue Service intends to purchase secure courier services for the pickup and delivery of cash tax payments.  There are currently 177 IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) located throughout the United States.  Each business day, the cash funds collected from tax payments must be safely transported to a designated financial institution. Currently, there is no uniform system for safely handling and delivering these funds.  

Objectives

The goal of this procurement is to establish a safe and uniform process for delivering cash from IRS TACs to TGA Cash vaults.  The use of secure courier services will enable the funds to be safely transferred and accounted for.  Because there are 177 centers located throughout the country, it is imperative that the vendor(s) selected for contract awards be able to cover as many of the tax centers on a nationwide basis as possible.  In order to create the most effective process for the transfer of these funds, the successful vendors shall collectively be able to supply secure courier services for all given locations.  The number of awards will be determined by the regional coverage and pricing proposed by the offerors.

NOTE:  While there are 177 TAC sites overall, ten (10) of these sites have been identified as priority requirements and will be temporarily serviced by other means.  For the purposes of the contract(s) resulting from this solicitation, ALL TAC sites should be priced.  The 10 priority sites will be awarded as optional contract line items (CLINs) for the base award period, with the expectation that they will be added to the base period during FY 09.  All of the 177 TAC sites will be included as CLINs in Option Year Periods 1 through 4.  By including these 10 additional/priority TACs in this way, pricing will be predetermined when the need arises to add these TACs as active pickup sites at some point in the future. 
The secure courier service will pick up cash receipts and the deposit form (Form 10160  see attached) at the TAC by close of business, Monday through Friday (excluding Federal Holidays: New Years Day; Martin Luther King Jr. Day; Washingtons Birthday; Memorial Day; Independence Day; Labor Day; Columbus Day; Veterans Day; Thanksgiving Day; Christmas Day.  The shipments will be picked up from:

Form 10160 (see attached) will accompany all courier pickup bags.  The courier will have the Form signed and dated at the cash vault at the time of deposit.  The signed and dated Form 10160 will be given to the IRS at the time of the next pickup at the IRS location.

Pricing Instructions
The Contractor shall:
	Use the attached Spreadsheets to provide pricing for pick-up and delivery per site.  Provide prices for each site on a per week basis.  Please note that all proposed pricing shall reflect total pick-up and delivery pricing per site at the time of initial contract performance; i.e.    PROPOSAL SPREADSHEET SHALL INDICATE TOTAL PRICE PER SITE INCLUSIVE OF FUEL CHARGES AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONTRACT AWARD.  Any subsequent proposed changes due to economic price adjustments (fuel price adjustments) shall be very clearly stated in terms of what is proposed and how it is to be determined and calculated.  

	Offerors MUST indicate which TGA facility they will utilize for deposit of funds for each TAC site proposed. This shall be done using the proposal spreadsheet.  

	Provide pricing for tamper-proof bags

	Indicate clearly which sites will not be covered/include proposed pricing (i.e. either provide price or indicate N/A; no blank lines)  (Please note: pricing should only be provided for those sites for which the vendor is able to comply with the requirement for same day deposit of funds).

NOTE:  While there are 177 TAC sites overall, ten (10) of these sites have been identified as priority requirements and will be temporarily serviced by other means.  For the purposes of the contract(s) resulting from this solicitation, ALL TAC sites should be priced.  The 10 priority sites will be awarded as optional contract line items (CLINs) for the base award period, with the expectation that they will be added to the base period during FY 09.  All of the 177 TAC sites will be included as CLINs in Option Year Periods 1 through 4.  By including these 10 additional/priority TACs in this way, pricing will be predetermined when the need arises to add these TACs as active pickup sites in the future. 

Additional Instructions to Offerors
The Contractor shall provide proposed schedule/times for pick-up from TACs and proposed location of TGA cash vault where funds will be deposited.  (Please note that no pick-ups should be scheduled for earlier than 9:30 am local time).

At a minimum, include name of client (federal, state, or local government, or commercial customer), phone number, e-mail, contract number, total value, period of performance, and relevance to proposed requirement.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
	a) The Government will award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror or offerors whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   

1) Ability to meet Tasks/Requirements/Deliverables outlined in the Solicitation  
2) Ability to pick up receipts from the TACs before close of business each day and to comply with same calendar day deposit requirement
3) Geographical Area(s) covered, number of locations proposed
4) Security of services provided 
5) Proper bonding/licensing/insurance 
6) Experience
7) Past Performance
8) Pricing

The factors above are listed in order of importance. Technical Factors one (1) through six (6) and past performance are more important, when combined, compared to Price.  The importance of price will increase as the difference in technical comparisons decreases.  Award(s) will be made relative to best overall value to the Government.  Offers must meet all minimum qualifications, but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.  Notwithstanding that technical capability and past performance are more importance than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.  

Offerors shall provide a minimum of three references with name of company, point of contact, and phone number for past performance.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.
  
	b) Options  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine than an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

	c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offers specified time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

June 9, 2008
The following question was received regarding this procurement:
	
	Which of the following alternatives is acceptable?

1.	To utilize our resources to pick up funds at the TACs and deliver to branches of the banks listed within the time constraints, and to obtain same day credit.
 
2.	To utilize our resources which operate on a route and to pick up funds at TACs and deliver to bank money centers at the end of day to the money centers with  credit being assessed the next day. 

3.	Will either or both of these possibilities be acceptable? 

Answer:

The secure transport of, and receiving credit for, our deposits within 24 hours after pick-up are of major importance to this procurement. This could be accomplished with number 1 or 2 above, or a combination of the two. We will evaluate the cost and effectiveness of the method chosen by the respondent in accordance with the evaluation factors as stated in the solicitation.

The date for receipt of proposals has not been extended as a result of this amendment.  All terms and conditions remain the same as stated in the original solicitation.  

To All Interested Offerors:
 
 It has come to our attention that there may have been some degree of confusion regarding the Government's requirements in satisfaction of Solicitation Number TIRNO-08-R-00017, Secure Courier Services.  In order to be completely clear and to ensure a fair opportunity to all offerors, we are amending the solicitation in order to clarify the requirement.  
 
The confusion appears to have been due to varying interpretations of our intention for the time required between pick-up of funds at the Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) and the subsequent delivery of funds to the TGA bank/vault facilities.  Our requirement is to have the cash funds picked up from the TACs on a daily basis with funds deposited in the TGA vault facilities on the SAME CALENDAR DAY.
 
In addition, please note that all proposed pricing shall reflect total pick-up and delivery pricing per site at the time of initial contract performance.    PROPOSAL SPREADSHEET SHALL INDICATE TOTAL PRICE PER SITE INCLUSIVE OF FUEL CHARGES AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONTRACT AWARD.  Any subsequent proposed changes due to economic price adjustments (fuel price adjustments) shall be very clearly stated in terms of what is proposed and how it is to be determined and calculated.  
 
 Offerors MUST indicate which TGA facility they will utilize for deposit of funds for each TAC site proposed, This shall be done using the pricing spreadsheet.    Please review the amended solicitation for an updated listing of banks that serve as TGA vaults. This list is not intended as an all-inclusive list of TGA facilities.  Offerors may utilize TGA facilities that are not on this list.    
 
Since the time that the original solicitation was issued, we have had 6 of the original 167 TACs change addresses. Those six are Lakeland, Melbourne and Panama City, FL, Gulfport, MS, White Plains, NY and Hampton, VA. These TACs are listed first on the attached spreadsheet. Also, both addresses are shown in red, the old address has the line drawn through it.  Additionally, of the 10 priority TACs listed, Harlingen, TX was moved to McAllen, TX, as noted on its attached spreadsheet.

  
 The attached solicitation has been  amended  to make these clarifications.   Please review the amended solicitation carefully and note all changes, which have been indicated in red for ease of identification.   Please review your proposal to determine whether or not you wish to make revisions as a result of this clarification.  All revised proposals must be received by Yelena Solovey Jackson no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on  September  10, 2008.  All revised proposals are to be submitted electronically to Ms. Jackson at: Yelena.solovey@irs.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add a drawing of the existing NIST system and to provide additional information.  As a result, this solicitation is amended as follows:

1)  Added drawing of NIST system as uploaded herein.

2)  In regard to the application of the gauging system, it is NIST's preference that the equipment be installed on the existing paper machine line without major relocation of machine components. However, NIST understands that for safety and operational reasons, there may be alternative installations that require more space between the calender and the reel of the paper machine. If an alternative requires the relocation of the reel, the maximum that the reel can be moved downstream is two (2) meters.

Except as amended herein, all other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>a. This is Amendment 0002 to Solicitation W9132V-08-R-0012, Foreign Media Monitoring Translation System.<BR><BR>b.  The date and time for receipt of quotes is hereby changed to 8 September 2008, 2:00 pm EST.<BR><BR>c.  This amendment provides answers to questions submitted by prospective offerors:<BR><BR>Question 1.  Are there any specific metrics for the web crawler?<BR><BR>Answer 1.  The web crawler should be able to maintain a 90 day history of at least 30 sites, with the crawler checking for site updates at least two times a day (a larger number of sites and more frequent updates is desirable, but not required).  The crawler should index at a 'depth' of at least 2 'hops' from the main page.  <BR><BR>Question 2. Is there a requirement for persistent web crawling (constant re-indexing of the entire internet basically) or 'on demand' where a user initiates it and defines the depth and other parameters with automation then applied (e.g. scheduling)?<BR><BR>Answer 2.  After initial user/factory setup, the website indexing functionality should be completely automated, running 24/7.  See answer above for more details on frequency of checking website updates and 'depth'.  <BR><BR>Question 3. How should storage (Data Warehousing) be addressed?  Provide a turnkey solution or use of Government DISA sites?  If the contractor provides solution must it be secure, etc.?<BR><BR>Answer 3.  The system should be a 'turnkey' system meaning that all required storage should be included.  <BR><BR>Question 4. Is web crawling on foreign web-site in Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, and English Or is it English only crawling?<BR><BR>Answer 4.  The web crawling is down on websites containing Modern Standard Arabic, Iraqi Arabic and English.  The indexing should be stored in both the original language, and the destination language (English), if applicable.  <BR><BR>Question 5. What is the security level of the LAN? <BR><BR>Answer 5.  Unknown.  For the web crawling ability, the contractor should assume that an 'open' path to the Internet exists and is available to the FMM system.  <BR><BR>Question 6.  Will the Internet Service Provider (ISP) be provided for the web crawler?<BR><BR>Answer 6.  Yes.  The contractor should assume that there is an Internet hookup available.  If chosen, more details about integrating into the Units LAN will be provided (Static IP, DHCP, DNS servers, etc.).  <BR><BR>Question 7.  Is there already an existing firewall to negate a virus threat on the LAN or will it be required?<BR><BR>Answer 7.  No firewall in the FMM is required.  <BR><BR>Question 8. Does a LAN exist for the users or is the Contractor to provide the Ethernet LAN and Workstations?  If it exists what is the interface to the Users (e.g. 100 or 1000 Gigabit Ethernet)<BR><BR>Answer 8.  The end user LAN exists.  If the system being offered interacts entirely with the user through a web interface so that the user simply needs to point a web browser to the IP of the system, then no Workstations are required.  If the system has its own proprietary Workstations, then enough Workstations for up to 4 simultaneous users should be included in the quote.  The exact makeup of the LAN is unknown, but the contractor should assume that it is at least a 10/100 Mb/sec LAN.  <BR><BR>Question 9.  If the Contractor is to provide the LAN, the actual requirements need to be provided.<BR><BR>Answer 9.  See above.  The system should be a turnkey system that can be dropped into an existing LAN.  <BR><BR>Question 10.  It is assumed the Government will provide the feeds to be analyzed.  Please provide the interface and technical standards for the interfaces (i.e., are we interfacing to internet? Satellite raw feeds?) Please provide the technical specifications and exact manufacturer and part numbers for all receivers.<BR><BR>Answer 10.  The Government will provide their own audio and video sources.  The contractor should expect video to be provided in a standard composite input (RCA jack), and the audio to be provided in standard stereo (RCA jack).  The Contractor should assume that the LAN that the FMM will be on has Internet connectivity.  If chosen, the Government will provide more information on the specific LAN setup.   <BR><BR>Question 11.  The time frame for delivery of a quality translation system meeting your specific requirements is not realistic. Such a system needs substantial customized configuration, system integration, and a testing cycle before turn-over.  Therefore, we request that delivery be changed from 60 days to 180 days.<BR><BR>Answer 11.  The RFQ is not for new development.  The governments market research indicates there are offerors capable of providing commercial-off-the-shelf functional systems within the stated deadline.<BR><BR>Question 12. We request that Translation Quality be part of the evaluation criteria as it distinguishes between companies providing the lowest level of functionality and those who can provide expansion option and higher quality (accuracy) in translation. We would like to point out that while there is no perfect translation product on the 'Commercial' market, IMV will propose to use the top rated translation software in the marketplace as a part of our customized system architecture.  We point you to the text translation comparisons performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology recommending specific translation products as being the most accurate on the market.  Please see:  http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/2006/doc/mt06eval_official_results.html. Therefore, NIST standards should be made a part of the quality standard in determining acceptability of the system.<BR><BR>Answer 12.   Translation Quality is already a part of the evaluation, see paragraph 7.  Excerpt: 'Systems will be selected based on evidence of translation capability (translation accuracy subject to expected media conditions)... This selection will be based on results of laboratory testing, evaluations by military personnel and documented performance data supplied by the vendor on their systems.'<BR><BR>Question 13.  While we can meet all your system requirements, more than 15 days from closing of the solicitation would be needed to develop a demonstration.  Therefore, we request that the demonstration be given 60 days from closing. <BR>Answer 13.  As this is an RFQ for a COTS product, the vendor should be able to have a working system ready for demo within 15 days of RFQ closing.<BR> <BR>Question 14. In reviewing the interested parties list in FedBizOpps, it was noticed that there are at least 2 (two) small businesses that may be able to respond to the solicitation.  IMV is also a small business and it is requested that the solicitation be set aside for small business in accordance with FAR 19.502-2 (b) (1).<BR><BR>Answer 14.  The governments market research indicated that two or more small businesses were not capable of providing a commercial off the shelf product that could meet the governments requirement.<BR><BR>Question 15.  This is not a commercial off the shelf (COTS) system using catalog pricing but rather a system developed using unique systems architecture, complex commercial software, and customized programming.  The short timeframe between RFP advertisement and closing is not supportive of fostering an environment of effective competition.  Therefore, it is requested that the closing date be extended by 15 days.   For this same reason, it is recommended that the pricing arrangement be changed from a Firm Fixed Price to a Fixed Price Level of Effort with a Not-To- Exceed Ceiling Price for Materials.<BR><BR>Answer 15.  The governments requirement for a COTS product is necessary to meet delivery requirements critical to satisfy mission needs.  <BR><BR>Question 16.  Is email submission acceptable?<BR><BR>Answer 16. Proposals sent via email will NOT be considered.  Responses to the RFQ AND DELIVERY of the units should be mailed or delivered to: U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Topographic Engineer Center, Attn:  CEERD-CT-A (Toni Davis/Nilda Lugo), 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315-3864. If proposals are hand delivered, they must be delivered to the Contracts Office, Attn: Nilda Lugo, Contracting Officer (703-428-6272) or Toni Davis, Contract Specialist (703-428-6632), Building 2592 (Cude Building), located on the grounds of the Humphrey Engineering Center, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria VA  22315-3864, in order to be properly time and date stamped.  Due to security measures, advance notification to Toni Davis, Contract Specialist (phone 703-428-6632 or fax 703-428-6995) or Nilda Lugo, must be provided so that the guard on Leaf Road gate can be made aware of your arrival.  Hours of operation are 8:00 am through 4:00 pm eastern time, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays.  Due to the security measures at the building, offerors must allow sufficient time to adhere to the security procedures at the front desk.  Offerors cannot proceed unescorted to the depository noted.  Delays caused by TEC employees adherence to security procedures will not constitute cause for allowing late receipt of offers<BR><BR> <BR>Question 17.  What is the expected ceiling of award?<BR><BR>Answer 17.  There isnt a ceiling for the award.  <BR><BR>Question 18.  Are there any restrictions on length?<BR><BR>Answer 18.  No.<BR><BR>Question 19.  I am inquiring about the Foreign Media Monitoring Translation System.  On FBO there are two solicitation numbers listed for this, W9132V-08-R-0012 & W9132V-08-R-0010.  Are these two separate 'on there own' programs or was one mistakenly put on FBO.  If it was a mistake which solicitation number is the correct one?<BR><BR>Answer 19.  They are two separate requirements.<BR><BR>d.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.<BR>

FOB; Destination, -Accountable Property Officer, Building 5464, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway Utah, 84022,<BR><BR>(APR 2004) (a) This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103. An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed. A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA. (b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following: (1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services. (2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request. (3) An award or proposed award of the contract. (4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract. (c) Voluntary Automatic Stay. This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4). (1) In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest. This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay override. (2) The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing. A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.<BR><BR>Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies. (3) The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program. Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice. The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action. (d) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. (e) For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority. (f) An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest. (g) Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from :Mr Vokt, Eric S.(Contracting Officer),( DIRECTOR OF CONTRACTING- DUGWAY, UT 84022) .

FOB; Destination, -Accountable Property Officer, Building 5464, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway Utah, 84022,<BR><BR>(APR 2004) (a) This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103. An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed. A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA. (b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following: (1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services. (2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request. (3) An award or proposed award of the contract. (4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract. (c) Voluntary Automatic Stay. This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4). (1) In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest. This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay override. (2) The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing. A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.<BR><BR>Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies. (3) The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program. Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice. The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action. (d) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. (e) For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority. (f) An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest. (g) Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from :Mr Vokt, Eric S.(Contracting Officer),( DIRECTOR OF CONTRACTING- DUGWAY, UT 84022) .

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to issue a solicitation to re-compete the Technical Support for the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health's Review of NIOSH Dose Reconstruction Program contract, CDC contract number 200-2004-03805. The CDC Office of Compensation Analysis and Support (OCAS) is responsible for conducting individual dose reconstructions on employees of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies, its contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs) under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA). To support NIOSH's role under EEOICPA, OCAS has retained the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of major program elements. Under EEOICPA, the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (Advisory Board) is required to review a reasonable sample of dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality, assess the methods for dose reconstruction, and review Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) petitions. To support the Advisory Board, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of tasks related to independent review of the dose reconstruction process. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the reconstruction of dose provides a reasonable estimate of the dose (as needed to adjudicate the claim). The contractor shall evaluate and recommend whether or not the assumptions (individual case assumptions and assumptions applicable to multiple cases) made for dose reconstruction are appropriate and defensible for purposes of this program. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the data from DOE or other sources is of sufficient quality necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate of dose. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the dose reconstruction was performed fairly using NIOSH guidelines and in a manner consistent with other cases. The contractor shall review all relevant dose reconstruction methodologies and/or procedures employed by NIOSH / NIOSH contractors in conducting individual dose reconstructions and SEC petitions. The contractor shall evaluate whether methodologies and procedures are consistent with requirements under 42 CFR 82 and whether there are sufficient procedures to achieve consistent application of the requirements in 42 CFR 82. The contractor shall conduct one of three different levels of review on the selected cases: 1) Basic Review, 2) Advanced Review, or 3) Blind Review. The method of review will be determined by the Advisory Board. The number of individual dose reconstruction reviews is estimated to be approximately 62 in the first year. It is expected that there will be approximately 30 Basic Review cases, 30 Advanced Review cases and 2 Blind Review cases. The next four years will also involve a review of approximately 62 cases per year. The breakdown of cases will be the same as described for the first year. The Advisory Board shall determine the cases to be reviewed and the level of review. These percentages are subject to change by the Advisory Board based on experience with the review process. Request for Proposal No. 2008-N-10428 will be issued on an unrestricted basis to full and open competition. The solicitation will be available on or about July 11, 2008, and proposals due by August 15, 2008. Solicitation documents will also be available at www.fbo.gov. All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>Special Notice DARPASN08-51QUANTUM EFFECTS IN BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTS (QuBE); WORKSHOP DATE: September 29-30, 2008; REGISTRATION DEADLINE: September 26, 2008;
TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Matthew Goodman, DARPA/DSO

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop to discuss innovative research that will investigate the way that nature may be exploiting quantum mechanical effects in biological systems.

Manifestly quantum effects have been postulated to have roles in a number of biological systems.  Recently experimental results have demonstrated long-lived quantum coherence in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) Bacteriochlorophyll complex (Nature 446, (2007), 782) and in the purple bacteria reaction center (Science, 316, (2007), 1462).  Furthermore, a quantum algorithm at work in the FMO complex which could have profound implications in the quantum information field.  In addition there may be other examples of quantum effects.  For example, new experimental results have led to the postulate that the magnetic navigation ability of some species of birds is due to the quantum Zeno effect in a photo-responsive protein complex.  

The DARPA QuBE Workshop will be held in the offices of Booz Allen Hamilton at 3811 N. Fairfax Dr., Suite 1000, Arlington, VA, 22203.  The ultimate goal of the workshop is to identify model biological systems and quantum effects for study, and to recommend research directions that would clarify the nature and potential impact of these effects.  The success of this workshop will rely heavily on group discussion of the research challenges across this interdisciplinary topic; as such, it is expected that participants will have relevant research experience.

The workshop will take place on September 29, 2008 between 1:00-7:00 PM, and September 30, 2008 between 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM. Sign-in and badging will take place on 29 September only; any participants who are not planning to attend the first day of the workshop must notify the organizers in advance.

There is no fee for the QuBE Workshop. Details on the workshop, including registration information, can be found at the following URL: https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=QUA47573, conference code QUA47573.

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 35 people, maximum 2 from each institution).  The registration cutoff date is September 26, 2008, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted additional participants on a first-come, first-serve basis.  Further administrative information is available from Ms. Jennifer Thabet (thabet.jennifer@bah.com).  Additional technical information can be obtained from Dr. Matthew Goodman (Matthew.Goodman@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the QuBE Workshop in any correspondence.  This special announcement is not a request for proposals.

The Government will not state a number hours also, because it may change the creative way or strategy a vendor may propose. The Executive Coaching is for four government senior executives as stated in the SOO.  All other terms and conditions remain unchaged.<BR>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to issue a requirement for the replacement of battery systems at twenty-five (25) Air Route Traffic Control Center Critical/Essential Power System (ACEPS) facilities.  The requirement is for the replacement of 1 or 2 battery strings at each ACEPS site, which will be listed under the Screening Information Request.  Some of the sites have 3, 4, 5, or 6 battery strings, therefore multiple trips to a site could be required to accomplish all string replacements.
The requirement is being considered for an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) consisting of a one year base period and four one-year options periods for a total contract period not to exceed 5 years, or 60 months.      
The ACEPS Battery Replacement project proposed under this requirement consists of the following general requirements, as a minimum:
a.	The battery strings shall consist of 192 ea. cells/jars.  b.	Each single cell jar shall have a float voltage of 2.25 volts per cell (Vpc).c.	End of duty cycle voltage or minimum voltage during duty cycle shall be 1.67 Vpc.d.	Sealed jars, i.e. the jars have no provision for the addition of water or electrolyte or for external measurement of electrolyte specific gravity.e.	Lead-Acid Cells.  Cells in which the electrodes are made of lead or lead alloys and the electrolyte is a solution of sulfuric acid.f.	The battery shall utilize a technology that has been used by the Vendor for a minimum of 5 years.g.	Battery string footprint (maximum):  240" L x 28" D x 88" Hh.	Maximum weight of battery jar:  240 lbs.
The anticipated issue date of the Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) is 11 September 2008, with a scheduled closing date of 28 October 2008.  A copy of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer can be located at:  http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm, on/or about the issue date noted above.       
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 335911; Storage Battery Manufacturing, with a small business size standard in number of employees of 500.
Interested sources are encouraged to review the SIR/RFO and provide questions or comments in writing to Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov, or via facsimile at: (202) 267-5420, by 1:00 p.m. EDST, 25 September 2008.  Comments should be submitted in Microsoft Word 2003 format only.  Responses to Q&As will be posted to the FAA Contract Opportunity database as soon as they are available.  (Note: The FAA will not respond to telephone inquiries.)  
The FAA proposes to conduct a Pre-proposal Conference under the subject requirement at the FAA's Atlanta ARTCC Site located in Hampton, GA.  The details of the Conference (time, date and other pertinent information) will be outlined in the SIR.  As this is an active facility, proposed attendees will be required to submit the following information no later than one week prior to the scheduled conference date: 1) Name of Attendee(s), limited to two; 2) Name and address of company being represented; and any additional questions not previous submitted under separate cover.  All Q&A are anticipated to be reviewed at the Conference. The conference will include a mini-walkthrough of the facility to view existing conditions.       
All responses to the SIR/RFO must be submitted in accordance with page 1, Block 9, and Section L, "Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offers" of the SIR/RFO.

<DESC>Announcement has been amended to reflect the corrected NAICS code from 541712 to 541990 and to extend the due date to September 3, 2008.


National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program, Statistical Research and Applications Branch intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute for Technology Assessment; 101 Merrimac Street, 10th floor; Boston, MA 02114-4724 for services regarding a Multiscale Lung Cancer Policy Model.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.501. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7M. 

Period of performance:  September 30, 2008 through March 30, 2009.

The Massachusetts General Hospitals Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) is an affiliate member of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Lung Group, which focuses on modeling population trends.  The ITA team has developed a Lung Cancer Policy Model (LCPM) to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cancer control interventions, including screening strategies. As part of the ICBP program, the Center for the Development of a Virtual Tumor (CViT) team has developed a multiscale NSCLC model for EGFR-ERK signaling path way of NSCLC within an in silico microenvironment.

The ITA team has initiated preliminary work on developing a reaction-diffusion model (more specifically, a growth model based on Cahn-Hilliard equations) to improve the spatial resolution of tumor growth for population-based screening models.  This component will utilize the output from the CViT NSCLC model to inform the tumor growth trajectory for the LCPM.  The goal is to create a lung cancer model with individual NSCLC patients biochemical details such as their responses to external stimuli, the underlying properties of signaling networks, and cellular biological responses, and improved spatial resolution for lung cancer screening.

The contractor shall:

1. Integrate a CViT NSCLC model into the ITA LCPM.  

2. Contractor shall make necessary coding changes to the model and perform simulations to generate outputs.  The technical details of model integration will be documented.

The mission of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) is to conduct health outcomes research to guide the development, evaluation and utilization of medical technologies that improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of medical care.  The Center for the Development of a Virtual Tumor (CViT), brings together a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary group of investigators with interest in the biomedical, the computational and the mathematical aspects of cancer research. CViTs long term goal is to develop a generic, module-based tool-kit for modeling and simulating selected cancer types of interest such as breast, brain, lung cancer, and melanoma following a paradigm-shifting cross-disciplinary complex systems approach. Combined with cutting edge biomedical data, the modeling tool-kit will have significant value for experimental cancer research as it allows researchers to properly study cancer initiation and such critically linked progression features as invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis in the context of an emergent system. Ultimately, the tool-kit will also have important clinical applications including trial design and management as well as patient outcome predictions.

Both the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) and The Center for the Development of a Virtual Tumor CViT teams are located at MGH, a unique environment with expertise in both population level lung cancer modeling and subcellular/cellular level modeling of non-small cell lung cancer.  The close connection between the two teams is imperative for collaboration with the model integration process and therefore Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) is the only source known to the NCI capable of performing the work outlined in the procurement. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on September 3, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80200-NG on all correspondence.

REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT OF 1965
(a) Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended: This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended (41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) and is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor issued thereunder (29 CFR part 4).(b)(1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the concessioner, or any contractor or subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract.(2)		(i) If there is such a wage determination attached to this contract, the contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this section.(ii) Such conforming procedure shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class of employee. A written report of the proposed conforming action, including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved or, where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves, shall be submitted by the contractor to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class of employees performs any contract work. The contracting officer shall review the proposed action and promptly submit a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendation and all pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the contracting officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary.(iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the contracting officer who shall promptly notify the contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination.(iv)	(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed.(B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to this section, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to such conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the contractor shall advise the contracting officer of the action taken but the other procedures in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section need not be followed.(C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.(v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work.(3) If, as authorized pursuant to section 4(d) of the Service Contract Act of 1965 as amended, the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, pursuant to wage determinations to be issued by the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration of the Department of Labor as provided in such Act.(c) The contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined conformably thereto by furnishing any equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential payments in cash in accordance with the applicable rules set forth in subpart D of 29 CFR part 4, and not otherwise.(d)(1) In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under the contract (regardless of whether they are service employees) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this provision shall relieve the contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for the payment of a higher wage to any employee.(2) If this contract succeeds a contract, subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965 as amended, under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreements, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of   4.1b(b) of 29 CFR part 4 apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or his authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in   4.10 of 29 CFR part 4 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in   4.11 of 29 CFR part 4, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's-length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's-length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract. 53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973). In the case of a wage determnation issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision.(e) The contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract.(f) The contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees engaged to furnish these services, and the contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR part 1925.(g)(1) The contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work records containing the information specified in paragraphs (g)(1) (i) through (vi) of this section for each employee subject to the Act and shall make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor: 		(i) Name and address and social security number of each employee. 	(ii) The correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of fringe benefit payments in lieu thereof, and total daily and weekly compensation of each employee. (iii) The number of daily and weekly hours so worked by each employee.(iv) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee.(v) A list of monetary wages and fringe benefits for those classes of service employees not included in the wage determination attached to this contract but for which such wage rates or fringe benefits have been determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative pursuant to the labor standards clause in paragraph (b) of this section. A copy of the report required by the clause in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be deemed to be such a list.(vi) Any list of the predecessor contractor's employees which had been furnished to the contractor pursuant to   4.6(l)(2).(2) The contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division.(3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available such records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce such records, the contracting officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification of the contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violation ceases.(4) The contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours.(h) The contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or Regulations, 29 CFR part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. Such payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which such wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly.(i) The contracting officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government prime contractor under this or any other Government contract with the prime contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the contracting officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the agency may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of these clauses relating to the Service Contract Act of 1965, may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the contractor in default with any additional cost.(j) The contractor agrees to insert these clauses in this section relating to the Service Contract Act of 1965 in all subcontracts subject to the Act. The term contractor as used in these clauses in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term Government prime contractor.(k)(1) As used in these clauses, the term service employee means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in part 541 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as of July 30, 1976, and any subsequent revision of those regulations. The term service employee includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or subcontractor and such persons.(2) The following statement is included in contracts pursuant to section 2(a)(5) of the Act and is for informational purposes only:The following classes of service employees expected to be employed under the contract with the Government would be subject, if employed by the contracting agency, to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5 U.S.C. 5332 and would, if so employed, be paid not less than the following rates of wages and fringe benefits: Employee class	Monetary wage-fringe benefits  To be completed following award of this CONTRACT	-------------------(l)(1) If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government prime contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government prime contractor shall report such fact to the contracting officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance, such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof.(2) Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a contractor (predecessor) or successor (  4.173 of Regulations, 29 CFR part 4), the incumbent prime contractor shall furnish to the contracting officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor contractors of each such service employee. The contracting officer shall turn over such list to the successor contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract.(m) Rulings and interpretations of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR part 4.(n)(1) By entering into this contract, the contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed pursuant to section 5 of the Act.(2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract pursuant to section 5 of the Act.(3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001.(o) Notwithstanding any of the clauses in paragraphs (b) through (m) of this section relating to the Service Contract Act of 1965, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Public Law 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business:(1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical, or mental deficiency or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Service Contract Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of that Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).(2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Service Contract Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing

<DESC>**The purpose of this modification is to provide information pertaining to MIL-STD-777 referenced in the synopsis.  Below is a conform copy of the synopsis.**

THIS IS A Request for Information (RFI) NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. THIS RFI IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. The Naval Systems Engineering Directorate (SEA 05) of the Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is seeking information from vendors with experience in applying systems and component specifications and standards used in Navy shipbuilding and weapons and combat system acquisition programs to assist SEA 05 in identifying significant cost drivers associated with these programs and to recommend steps toward reducing the cost associated with the use of these specifications and standards in building a more affordable future fleet. This assessment should concentrate on the impact these requirements have on design, manufacturing, testing, and inspection costs. In assessing the cost impact of the specifications and standards when making a cost/benefit comparison, sour  ces!  are encouraged to consider the unique needs of warships and of the combat and weapons control systems which they carry. Your recommendations will have greater impact during the evaluation phase of this study if they clearly consider the world-wide operating environment of the U.S. Navy and the additional man-made environments (weapons effects) to which a warship and its systems are exposed when the ship is fulfilling its design purpose (i.e., surviving and overcoming the enemy in combat). 
The list of applicable specifications and standards subject to this request for information is provided below. Copies of these specifications and standards may be obtained from the ASSIST Website or by requesting a copy from the Government point of contact provided. ASSIST is the official database containing information about standardization documents used in DoD. Assist is located online at http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch (no password required) or http://assist.daps.dla.mil (pas  sword required).
a) MIL-S-901 Shock Technical Area (including MIL-S-901, NAVSEA 0908-LP-000-3010, Design Data Sheet DDS 072-1, Ship Specification Section 072).
b) Noise Technical Area (including MIL-STD-167/1 and MIL-STD-740)
c) NVR Chapter 8 relative to MIL-STD-1689 and MIL-STD-278 Fabrication requirements
d) MIL-M-17060 Motors, 60 Cycle, Alternating Current, Integral HP, Shipboard Use
e) MIL-STD-777 Schedule of Piping, Valves, Fittings and Associated Piping Components for Naval Surface Ships. (MIL-STD-777 IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING REVISION. RESPONSES REGARDING THIS SPECIFICATION SHOULD PERTAIN TO THE DRAFT REVISION.  COPIES OF THE DRAFT DEVISION MAY BE OBTAINED UPON REQUEST TO THE POC PROVIDED BELOW).
f) MIL-DTL-16036 Switchgear, Power, Low Voltage, Naval Shipboard in conjunction with use of MIL-Spec circuit breakers (MIL-C-17587, MIL-C-17361)
g) MIL-STD-461E - Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
h) MIL-STD 464A Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Requirements for Systems 
i) MIL-STD-469B \ NTIA Chapter 5 Radar Interface Requirements Respondents must be a System Integrator and/or Original Equipment Manufacturer using any or all of the specifications and standards listed above in the development, production, and sustainment of its products and have proven experience to support the cost and benefit comparison provided by the respondent with regard to:
1) Specification/Standard Content, Application, and Interpretation
a) Specification/Standard Content: The technical requirements associated with specifications and standards stated above are accurate and the costs associated with meeting specifications and standards requirements far exceed the differential benefit received through compliance.
b) Specification/Standard Application/Invocation: The content is reasonable, but not appropriate for non-critical applications and thus differing applications could reduce costs. i.e., What are the criteria of "non-critical" systems that the Specification/Standard should not apply to and what requirements of the Specification/Standard can be waived?
c) Specification/Standard Interpretation: Content and Application may be appropriate, but interpretation/enforcement practices add unnecessary costs. i.e., What standardization of the test criteria for each Specification/Standard is required to eliminate the contention of whether a system is meeting the requirements? Does the Specification/Standard provide cle  ar instruction on how each test is performed? Is the Specification or Standard invoked in a consistent and appropriately tailored form in the procurement documentation (Statement of Work, Ship Specification, and/or Weapons Specification)?
d) General assessment of costs drivers (i.e., labor, materials, administration, etc)
(2) Identification of potential alternatives (such as the use of commercial specifications or standards) for each of the targeted specifications and standards:
a) Equivalent commercial standards and specifications addressing the same issues for the requirements of interest.
b) Where applicable, the interrelationship among the commercial specifications and standards and Military Specifications and Standards.
c) The criteria that the commercial specifications and standards must meet so that the Military Standard could be replaced.
(3) Recommended steps to validate and implement lower cost alternatives
(4) For Shipyard processes, please address the following:
a) Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on redesign.
b) Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on installation costs.
c) Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on testing costs.
d) Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on other costs.
Interested sources are requested to provide UNCLASSIFIED documentation describing the potential cost savings which could reasonably be attributed to the modification of the Specification/Standard described by the respondent or resulting from the improved tailoring of the application of the Specification/Standard. This documentation should not exceed 30 pages in length. After government personnel have evaluated the respondents submissions, the government may elect to have its personnel contact a subset of the respondents to obtain additional information regarding the information provided by the respondent with respect to this request for information on the same terms as set forth below for this request for information.

<DESC>a. This is Amendment 0002 to Solicitation W9132V-08-R-0010, Foreign Media Monitoring Translation System.<BR><BR>b.  The date and time for receipt of quotes is hereby changed to 8 September 2008, 2:00 pm EST.<BR><BR>c.  This amendment provides answers to questions submitted by prospective offerors:<BR><BR>Question 1.  Are there any specific metrics for the web crawler?<BR><BR>Answer 1.  The web crawler should be able to maintain a 90 day history of at least 30 sites, with the crawler checking for site updates at least two times a day (a larger number of sites and more frequent updates is desirable, but not required).  The crawler should index at a 'depth' of at least 2 'hops' from the main page.  <BR><BR>Question 2. Is there a requirement for persistent web crawling (constant re-indexing of the entire internet basically) or 'on demand' where a user initiates it and defines the depth and other parameters with automation then applied (e.g. scheduling)?<BR><BR>Answer 2.  After initial user/factory setup, the website indexing functionality should be completely automated, running 24/7.  See answer above for more details on frequency of checking website updates and 'depth'.  <BR><BR>Question 3. How should storage (Data Warehousing) be addressed?  Provide a turnkey solution or use of Government DISA sites?  If the contractor provides solution must it be secure, etc.?<BR><BR>Answer 3.  The system should be a 'turnkey' system meaning that all required storage should be included.  <BR><BR>Question 4. Is web crawling on foreign web-site in Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, and English Or is it English only crawling?<BR><BR>Answer 4.  The web crawling is down on websites containing Modern Standard Arabic, Iraqi Arabic and English.  The indexing should be stored in both the original language, and the destination language (English), if applicable.  <BR><BR>Question 5. What is the security level of the LAN? <BR><BR>Answer 5.  Unknown.  For the web crawling ability, the contractor should assume that an 'open' path to the Internet exists and is available to the FMM system.  <BR><BR>Question 6.  Will the Internet Service Provider (ISP) be provided for the web crawler?<BR><BR>Answer 6.  Yes.  The contractor should assume that there is an Internet hookup available.  If chosen, more details about integrating into the Units LAN will be provided (Static IP, DHCP, DNS servers, etc.).  <BR><BR>Question 7.  Is there already an existing firewall to negate a virus threat on the LAN or will it be required?<BR><BR>Answer 7.  No firewall in the FMM is required.  <BR><BR>Question 8. Does a LAN exist for the users or is the Contractor to provide the Ethernet LAN and Workstations?  If it exists what is the interface to the Users (e.g. 100 or 1000 Gigabit Ethernet)<BR><BR>Answer 8.  The end user LAN exists.  If the system being offered interacts entirely with the user through a web interface so that the user simply needs to point a web browser to the IP of the system, then no Workstations are required.  If the system has its own proprietary Workstations, then enough Workstations for up to 4 simultaneous users should be included in the quote.  The exact makeup of the LAN is unknown, but the contractor should assume that it is at least a 10/100 Mb/sec LAN.  <BR><BR>Question 9.  If the Contractor is to provide the LAN, the actual requirements need to be provided.<BR><BR>Answer 9.  See above.  The system should be a turnkey system that can be dropped into an existing LAN.  <BR><BR>Question 10.  It is assumed the Government will provide the feeds to be analyzed.  Please provide the interface and technical standards for the interfaces (i.e., are we interfacing to internet? Satellite raw feeds?) Please provide the technical specifications and exact manufacturer and part numbers for all receivers.<BR><BR>Answer 10.  The Government will provide their own audio and video sources.  The contractor should expect video to be provided in a standard composite input (RCA jack), and the audio to be provided in standard stereo (RCA jack).  The Contractor should assume that the LAN that the FMM will be on has Internet connectivity.  If chosen, the Government will provide more information on the specific LAN setup.   <BR><BR>Question 11.  The time frame for delivery of a quality translation system meeting your specific requirements is not realistic. Such a system needs substantial customized configuration, system integration, and a testing cycle before turn-over.  Therefore, we request that delivery be changed from 60 days to 180 days.<BR><BR>Answer 11.  The RFQ is not for new development.  The governments market research indicates there are offerors capable of providing commercial-off-the-shelf functional systems within the stated deadline.<BR><BR>Question 12. We request that Translation Quality be part of the evaluation criteria as it distinguishes between companies providing the lowest level of functionality and those who can provide expansion option and higher quality (accuracy) in translation. We would like to point out that while there is no perfect translation product on the 'Commercial' market, IMV will propose to use the top rated translation software in the marketplace as a part of our customized system architecture.  We point you to the text translation comparisons performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology recommending specific translation products as being the most accurate on the market.  Please see:  http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/2006/doc/mt06eval_official_results.html. Therefore, NIST standards should be made a part of the quality standard in determining acceptability of the system.<BR><BR>Answer 12.   Translation Quality is already a part of the evaluation, see paragraph 7.  Excerpt:  'Systems will be selected based on evidence of translation capability (translation accuracy subject to expected media conditions)... This selection will be based on results of laboratory testing, evaluations by military personnel and documented performance data supplied by the vendor on their systems.'<BR><BR>Question 13.  While we can meet all your system requirements, more than 15 days from closing of the solicitation would be needed to develop a demonstration.  Therefore, we request that the demonstration be given 60 days from closing. <BR><BR>Answer 13.  As this is an RFQ for a COTS product, the vendor should be able to have a working system ready for demo within 15 days of RFQ closing.<BR> <BR>Question 14. In reviewing the interested parties list in FedBizOpps, it was noticed that there are at least 2 (two) small businesses that may be able to respond to the solicitation.  IMV is also a small business and it is requested that the solicitation be set aside for small business in accordance with FAR 19.502-2 (b) (1).<BR><BR>Answer 14.  The governments market research indicated that two or more small businesses were not capable of providing a commercial off the shelf product that could meet the governments requirement.<BR><BR>Question 15.  This is not a commercial off the shelf (COTS) system using catalog pricing but rather a system developed using unique systems architecture, complex commercial software, and customized programming.  The short timeframe between RFP advertisement and closing is not supportive of fostering an environment of effective competition.  Therefore, it is requested that the closing date be extended by 15 days.   For this same reason, it is recommended that the pricing arrangement be changed from a Firm Fixed Price to a Fixed Price Level of Effort with a Not-To- Exceed Ceiling Price for Materials.<BR><BR>Answer 15.  The governments requirement for a COTS product is necessary to meet delivery requirements critical to satisfy mission needs.  <BR><BR>Question 16.  Is email submission acceptable?<BR><BR>Answer 16. Proposals sent via email will NOT be considered.  Responses to the RFQ AND DELIVERY of the units should be mailed or delivered to: U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Topographic Engineer Center, Attn:  CEERD-CT-A (Toni Davis/Nilda Lugo), 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315-3864. If proposals are hand delivered, they must be delivered to the Contracts Office, Attn: Nilda Lugo, Contracting Officer (703-428-6272) or Toni Davis, Contract Specialist (703-428-6632), Building 2592 (Cude Building), located on the grounds of the Humphrey Engineering Center, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria VA  22315-3864, in order to be properly time and date stamped.

Due to the security measures at the building, offerors must allow sufficient time to adhere to the security procedures at the front desk.  Offerors cannot proceed unescorted to the depository noted.  Delays caused by TEC employees adherence to security procedures will not constitute cause for allowing late receipt of offers<BR><BR> <BR>Question 17.  What is the expected ceiling of award?<BR><BR>Answer 17.  There isnt a ceiling for the award.  <BR><BR>Question 18.  Are there any restrictions on length?<BR><BR>Answer 18.  No.<BR><BR>Question 19.  I am inquiring about the Foreign Media Monitoring Translation System.  On FBO there are two solicitation numbers listed for this, W9132V-08-R-0012 & W9132V-08-R-0010.  Are these two separate 'on there own' programs or was one mistakenly put on FBO.  If it was a mistake which solicitation number is the correct one?<BR><BR>Answer 19.  They are two separate requirements.<BR><BR>d.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.<BR>

The oversight provided for in the QASP will help to ensure that service levels reach and maintain the required levels throughout the contract term.  Further, the QASP provides the COTR and Quality Assurance Monitors at each Vet Center with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance, and provides verifiable input for the required Past Performance Information Assessments.  The QASP will be finalized immediately following award and a copy provided to the Contractor after award.   The QASP is a living document and may be updated by the Government as necessary. 1.4.3.1.1..

Government personnel will record all surveillance observations.  When an observation indicates defective performance or observes favorable performance, the COTR will require the contract manager or representative at the site to initial the observation.  The initialing of the observation does not necessarily constitute concurrence with the observation, only an acknowledgment that he or she has been made aware of the defective or favorable performance.  Government surveillance of tasks not listed in the PRS or by methods other than those listed in the PRS (such as the inspection and acceptance clause 52.212-4 (a) Contract terms and conditions - Commercial Items) may occur during the performance period of this contract.

Any action taken by the contracting officer as a result of surveillance will be done in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. 1.4.3.2.1. The Government reserves the right to perform quality assurance at each Vet Center, at the point of billing, and conduct random sampling throughout the performance period and delivery and acceptance of the data to VA employees.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a delivery order on a sole-source basis under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Number N00019-08-G-0009 to Northrop Grumman Space & Mission System, One Rancho Carmel, Mail Station RC1/3279, San Diego, CA  92128-3403.  Northrop Grumman Space & Mission System owns the data rights to the previous GrIIM RePr RePLACE.  This effort is an extension of the GrIIM RePr development and will require updates to the old L-304 software already developed/used I the E-2C Group Operational flight Program (OFP).  Specifically, under this development effort, the contractor will need to be able to modify the OFP to add functionality in the form of Software Trouble Reports (STRs) required from the fleet and residing in the GrIIM RePr computer.  In addition, Northrop Grumman has the infrastructure, algorithms, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), and software tools available for many of the new requirements.  See Numbered Note 22.
