<DESC>Description
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources to provide security screening services to ensure safe, courteous, and efficient passenger and baggage screening at United States airports.  Offerors shall review www.tsa.gov to learn about the background and the acquisition approach associated with this requirement.  To access the SPP information, go to the bottom right heading entitled “Spotlight” and click on the hyperlink directly under “Spotlight” entitled “Screening Partnership Program.”  This page contains links to the acquisition approach, program guidance, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), and press releases.   The draft Statement of Work is provided on the website for information purposes only. At this time, TSA will be conducting the acquisition process by pre-qualifying offerors to proceed to the next acquisition phase by establishing a Qualified Offeror List (QOL). The following provides a summary of the background and acquisition approach for the SPP:
BACKGROUND
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) P.L. 107-71 required the TSA to assume responsibility for passenger and baggage security screening operations at the nation’s airports by November 19, 2002. 49 U.S.C. § 44920 (ATSA §108) provides, in part, that TSA shall allow an airport operator to submit an application to have screening carried out by the screening personnel of a qualified private screening company: 

APPROACH Due to the potential number of airports and private contractors that may be interested in participating in the SPP, and the sensitive nature of the scope of work to be completed, TSA will follow a down-select acquisition approach which is as follows:

1)Develop Qualified Offeror Lists (QOL)(Phase I)
2)Select Offerors determined qualified for Qualified Vendor List (QVL)(Phase II)
3)Issue BOAs to QVL by Region (Phase II)
4)Issue Airport Task Orders Based on Best Value (Phase III)

The first phase is to establish two Qualified Offeror Lists (QOL’s).  One QOL for small businesses and one QOL for large businesses. The QOL’s will pre-qualify offerors seeking to compete for SPP contracts through mandatory GO/NO GO technical and financial requirements.  Offerors must pass statutory ATSA requirements and TSA requirements to be a qualified private screening company. The establishment of the QOL will streamline the acquisition process and allow for TSA to maintain greater control of the contract competition.

After establishing the QOL’s, TSA plans to implement the second phase of the procurement by issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) to those companies on the QOL.  The result of the RFP will be to award a Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) to those offerors evaluated to present the required technical and cost capabilities. A BOA is an agreement among parties (not a contract) with no minimum or maximum guarantee. The RFP will include the objectives of the SPP, key selection steps and dates, and information on the criteria and evaluation of the RFP responses. The QVL will establish the qualified offerors by geographical region who can compete for airport specific task orders.  The geographical region will be divided based upon the same regional lines as the TSA Area Directors.  However, Offerors and airport applicants will determine which or all of the geographical areas they would like to be considered for in the QOL/QVL process.  TSA plans to issue task orders for screening services at a particular airport based upon the area in which the airport exists.  Therefore, those offerors and airports on the area QVL for the area in which the airport exists and received a BOA may receive the task order RFP for that airport.   TSA plans to evaluate the small business QOL separately from the large business QOL utilizing the same evaluation criteria. 

The third phase includes those Offerors on the QVL who have been awarded BOAs. These qualified vendors may compete for airport specific task orders on a best value basis.  A BOA is an agreement among parties (not a contract) with no minimum or maximum guarantee.  As such, TSA will issue airport specific Task Orders (TOs) containing specific contract requirements, terms and conditions, tailored to meet the needs of specific airports.

Offerors responding to this combined solicitation/synopsis must submit capability and certification statements.  The capability and certification statements will address the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandatory requirements and TSA requirements which are provided in detail on www.tsa.gov.  

The ATSA and TSA requirements will be evaluated on a Go/NoGo basis.  Offerors who DO NOT meet the ATSA requirements identified as Go/No Go criteria WILL NOT be evaluated further on TSA requirements criteria. Only those qualified screening companies that meet the ATSA and TSA requirements will be placed on the QOL and will be determined to have a reasonable chance to be awarded a BOA and be competitively awarded a task order.

The detailed requirements of this synopsis are published on the SPP TSA website at  www.tsa.gov. Offerors shall access and review the SPP website prior to responding.
Proposals are due by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time on November 29, 2004 to the above address to the Attention of Sheila Roche. 

Any questions shall be emailed to OPT-OUT@tsa.gov. Offerors shall state ‘SOLICITATION QUESTION” in subject line of email or else the question may not be answered. The cutoff date for questions is 15 November.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) Chief Technology Officer (CTO) has a requirement for Threat Image Projection (TIP) Ready X-Ray (TRX) equipment to fulfill the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) (Public Law 107-71) requirements for screening of all passengers and property that will be carried aboard passenger aircraft operated within United States airspace.  The TRX equipment screens baggage and personal property that passengers carry onboard aircraft. 
The TSA's Security Technology Deployment Office (STDO) is responsible for procuring and deploying technology to support the safety and security of the movement of people and baggage throughout the nation’s airports. STDO is responsible for ensuring that new TRX systems and technologies provide airport -level security benefits. STDO is modernizing the current TRX system which will support both legacy and new functional capabilities.

The purpose of this announcement is to identify qualified technical sources for a contract to manufacture, maintain and deploy TRX systems.  The requirement also includes Training Tasks and Engineering Services.  Award of a contract is anticipated by May 2005, with a period of performance from the date of award for a minimum of three (3) years and a maximum of five (5) years. The Government requires unlimited rights to all data and computer software developed under this contract. In order to make a determination of qualified bidders, the TSA requires the following qualification information from interested sources:

1.	TSA Security Lab (TSL) Qualification: Offeror must submit at no cost to the Government a Production Sample Machine to the TSL no later than December 06, 2004 to be used as the test system for qualification.  During the qualification testing, the Offeror must provide testing and maintenance support at no cost to the Government.

2.	Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE): Offeror must provide at no cost to the Government three Production Sample Machines for an OUE no later than December 29, 2004.  During the OUE, the Offeror must provide maintenance support at no cost to the Government.  The OUE period of performance may require three (3) months of support.

The purpose of the evaluation is to identify those Offerors that have the expertise, interest and capabilities to perform the required tasks.  In the case where multiple vendors have teamed together to submit a Capabilities Statement, the Government will evaluate the capabilities of all members of the team during the evaluation.

After all testing is completed, a Qualified Vendor’s List (QVL) will be established.  Only those Offerors placed on the QVL will be eligible to respond to the subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP).  Placement on the QVL does not guarantee receipt of a TRX contract.  The Government reserves the right to open up the QVL again, at the convenience of the Government.  Interested parties responding to this announcement letter should carefully consider if they have all the expertise required to meet the Government’s requirements.  

This announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This announcement does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. An Offeror must be found qualified under this announcement in order to submit a proposal under the subsequent TRX RFP. Offerors will be notified in writing whether they qualify for the TRX proposal. Only proposal from qualified Offeror's teams will be evaluated for award. Changes in teaming arrangements after this initial announcement may invalidate an Offeror’s eligibility for consideration under TRX proposal unless prior approval is obtained by the Contracting Officer. 

Parties interested in competing for this requirement must notify Mr. Adam Freimanis within 15 calendar days of this notice with a single one page notice of interest. Interested parties must provide a TRX system for testing to the TSL by no later than December 06, 2004, at no cost to the government.  Only qualified sources will be permitted to submit a TRX proposal.

<SUBJECT>20--DEVELOP A LARGE APERTURE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE HULL ARRAY FOR SUBMARINE SONARS!!
<SOLNBR>N0002405R6302
<CONTACT>Steven D. Williams 202-781-3962 Contracting Officer, James R. Watts, 202-781-3958!!
<DESC>The Government is developing large aperture active and passive hull arrays for submarine sonars to supplement or replace existing systems.  This effort is developing state-of-the-art arrays and signal-processing techniques that will take advantage of the large horizontal and vertical apertures provided by these arrays.  Specific goals of the effort are: (1) To take advantage of the vertical distribution of ambient noise. (2) To provide accurate signal arrival path direction in horizontal and vertical    dimensions. (3) To be compatible with Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (A-RCI) and VIRGINIA-Class submarine non-propulsion electronics systems.  (4) To require small footprints and low heat generation. (5) To build and install arrays at a cost less than $500/channel.   Supporting this developmental effort, the Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS5) in Washington, DC is soliciting proposals for:  (1)	Innovative large aperture active and/or passive hull arrays designs.  (2) Innovative ideas for small footprint, small thickness, moderate power, low cost (<$100/channel) mid and high frequency broadband projectors.  (3) New approaches for constructing large aperture hull array acoustic baffles.  (4) Advanced decoupling materials necessary to optimize performance (e.g., materials with frequency-selective transmissivity). (5) The design and development of an electrical infrastructure that includes both outboard (i.e., low-cost small acoustic sensors with directional response) and inboard electronics. (6) The manufacturing production, integration and installation of a large aperture hull array Advanced Development Model (ADM) or prototype.   (7) High-sensitivity T&E measuring, recording and data analysis equipment needed to support any of the above efforts.   The expected result of this BAA is affordable, high performance sonar systems including low power electronic infrastructure and a processing system that will enable the design, development and integration of a large aperture hull array into the overall submarine sonar suite.   PROPOSALS Proposals may be submitted in the form of a Formal Proposal (described below) or White Paper (described later).  White Papers will be evaluated, and if it is in the best interests of the Government and sufficient funds are available, a Formal Proposal will be requested.

The MISDS uses a magneto inductive wireless remote command signaling system, including magneto-inductive transmitters and receivers, to control remote signaling of ordnance through all types of medium including salt water, earth, metal structures, etc.  Only Magneto Inductive Systems LTD has the in-depth knowledge of magneto inductive command communication and signaling devices to successfully accomplish this requirement.  MISL is the developer and manufacturer of the magneto inductive technology necessar y to implement this program and owns specific intellectual property.  There are no other known sources.  The purpose of this requirement is to conduct a 36-month System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) Phase for MISDS Transmitters and Receivers, Deliver Product Qualification Test Samples and Production units.  Any sources who believe they possess the ability to design, develop and produce a magneto-inductive wireless remote command signaling system must provide within 15 days of publication of this notice: (1) a description of your firm, (2) past experience designing, testing and producing magneto inductive wireless remote command signaling devices, (3) complete listing of any US Government contracts including contract number, amount, description of the project, sponsors name and telephone number, and, (4) any other pertinent information that should be considered to Naval S urface Warfare Center – Panama City, Attn:  Code XPS1/Mark Ross, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL. 32407-7001.

<CONTACT>Mark Ross 850-235-5624 , or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) to Magneto Inductive Systems Limited (MISL) USA of San Bernadino, CA on a sole source basis for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and production phases of the Magneto Inductive-Remote Activation Munitions System (MI-RAMS) program. The effort will include LRIP planning, long lead item procurement, and the manufacture, inspection, test and delivery of MI-RAMS. The government anticipates a period of performance for five years under an ID/IQ contract. The first year of the effort will involve LRIP planning such as long lead item identification for the production of the MI-RAMS system currently being developed under a sole source contract to MISL, Nova Scotia. The follow on years will involve procurement of long lead items  and the manufacture of the MI-RAMS hardware. The MI-RAMS is a lightweight, compact, man-portable magneto inductive transmitter and receiver system to be used by Special Operation forces (SOF) and combat engineers. MI-RAMS provides the capability to remotely control the detonation of demolition charges or to remotely operate other items of equipment such as beacons, laser markers, weapons, ground marking lights, etc. MI-RAMS will reliably propagate a signal through natural or manmade media such as water, earth or building structures. MI-RAMS will be compatible and functional with radio frequency (RF) RAMS (i.e. MI-RAMS and RF-RAMS will be able to be daisy-chained as mission requirements, tactics and terrain dictate) providing the operator a synergistic increase in remote operation capabilities. The MI-RAMS will operate in all environments such as arctic, tropic, temperate, urba n, beach zone and the surf zone (littoral) to depths less than 10 feet. The planned start date for this effort will be 4QFY04. The acquisition objective is for up to 5000 each MI transmitters, 10,000 Auxiliary Power Packs, 25,000 each MI Type A receivers, 50,000 Type B MI  receivers. Detailed tasks will be provided, defining the required efforts, in individual delivery orders issued under the ID/IQ contract. This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), as applied in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), is deemed applicable as the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies available from Magneto Inductive Systems Ltd, the only known supplier of magneto-inductive (MI) related technologies. NSWC-PC has determined that MISL is only known supplier of MI related technologies that can meet the op erational requirements of the MI-RAMS program. This determination was based on the results of 29 market surveys conducted by CSS/ONR since 1993 that resulted in no responses other than MISL. The MI-RAMS cannot be procured competitively utilizing a technical data package. Currently the patents and intellectual property rights to the relevant MI technologies either belong solely to  MISL or are Government patents licensed to MISL.     Additionally, per the approved MI-RAMS program Acquisition Plan, the LRIP and production quantities will be acquired from the system developer. MISL is the sole developer of MI-RAMS. NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees (based on NAICS Code 334290). FSC is 5895.

<SUBJECT>10--Development and Support of Crawling Autonomous Vehicles
<SOLNBR>N6133104R0054
<RESPDATE>092004
<CONTACT>Mark Ross 850-235-5624 , or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Panama City, Florida,(NSWC-PC), formerly Coastal Systems Station (CSS), intends to award a sole&#64979;source contract to Foster Miller, Inc. (FMI) of Waltham MA for the continued development and support of crawling autonomous vehicles through 30 September 2005. It is anticipated (based on the results of testing in Spring 04), that NSWC-PC will desire to utilize these same vehicles to support autonomous mine neutralization in the Surf Zone (SZ) and Very Shallow Water (VSW) area. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The VSW/SZ Mine Counter Measures (MCM) Program will enter its 7th year in FY05. Under guidance from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) the mission priority of the surf zone effort has shifted toward non-exhaustive lane reconnaissance and Reacquire-Id-Neutralize ( RIN) missions, instead of the exhaustive mapping mission. To this end contract N61331-99-C-0022 was awarded to FMI based on a proposal submitted under CSS Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 99-001.  During the life of this contract, the maturity of the FMI vehicles has increased. The FY 05 effort will focus on: (1) Designing, developing, and fabricating a small autonomous vehicle, capable of basic navigation and communications functions based on the SEA TALON design developed under Contract N61331-99-C-0022.  The vehicle will be large enough to carry a payload of up to 20 pounds of explosives, along with the Safe and Arming Device and the Remote Control Detonator; (2) Designing, developing, and fabricating a delivery system capable of releasing a 20-pound item from the Sea Talon upon command; and (3) Conducting two fleet demonstrations of these capabilities during Fiscal Year 2005 Only Foster Miller, Inc, as the incumbent on contract N61331-99-C-0022, has the in-depth knowledge of the vehicle design to successfully accomplish this requirement.  The SEA Talon vehicle is based on a design originally developed by FMI for land based Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) applications. Although NSWC-PC will obtain a final design package of the SEA Talon at the completion of this effort, currently there is no adequate description of the vehicle design that would allow a competitor to adequately perform this effort.  This is a follow-on effort for the continued development of a highly specialized system within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government in the approximate amount of $4,000,000 expended to date under contract that could not feasibly be recovered through c ompetition.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is $5.0M. FSC is 1075.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Magneto Inductive Systems Limited (MISL) USA of San Bernardino, CA for conduct of a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) planning study for the Magneto Inductive-Remote Activation Munitions System (MI-RAMS) program.  The MI-RAMS system is currently being developed under a sole source contract by MISL, Nova Scotia.  The LRIP planning study will include the development of plans and critical actions associated with LRIP of the system, identification of risk areas, and development of critical processes and procedures in preparation for LRIP and production.  The LRIP Planning Study will also include the identification of long lead items required for production of the various MI-RAMS components.  This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The MI-RAMS cannot be procured competitively utilizing a technical data package. Curre! ntly the patents and intellectual property rights to the relevant MI technologies either belong solely to  MISL or are Government patents licensed to MISL.     The company is thus the only source sufficiently knowledgeable in details of the system design and MI technology to perform the LRIP study.  Additionally, per the approved MI-RAMS program Acquisition Plan, the LRIP and production quantities will be acquired from the system developer. MISL is the sole developer of MI-RAMS.  Accordingly, MISL USA will be the sole provider of MI-RAMS LRIP and production quantities.  NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees (based on NAICS Code 334290). FSC is 5895.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals are not being requested.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to issue a purchase order on a  noncompetitive basis to Dr. Motoshi Suzuki, 418 Rutgers Street, Rockville, Maryland 20850, to provide research  services in the study on the isolation and purification of the mitochondria fission proteins. STATEMENT OF WORK: The Contractor shall provide all labor involved in the preparation of the relevant DNA samples and the expression of at least two different sample of spectroscopic purity for investigation by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance methods.    The Contractor shall specifically prepare DNA samples and express the encoded proteins that represent the human Drp1 and yeast Dnm1 proteins involved in control of mitochrondria fission as well as proteins important in apoptosis.  Further all expressed proteins shall be purified to greater than 98% as determined spectroscopically.   The Contractor shall optimize expression level of these proteins, work out the purification protocol for them, and check for their stability for temperature, pH, and detergent.  The sample quantities shall be at least 10 milligrams purified of each protein.  The research services shall be performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Laboratory of Cell Biology.  The Contractor shall submit to the Project Officer, the purified samples, a written report detailing the sequencing information, and the mass spectrometric results which verify the correct molecular mass of the proteins.  The Project Officer will monitor the Contractor’s performance,  review,  and approve the Contractor’s progress and completion of the work   All work shall be performed and all materials, chemicals, laboratory space, and computational facilities are available at the NIH, NHLBI, Laboratory of Cell Biology.   The period of performance for this project is not expected to exceed six (6) months from the award date of the contract.    This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541710.  Size standard 500 employees is applicable to this requirement.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement by submitting a response addressing how they intend to perform the statement of work.  Responses will be evaluated based upon documented past experience with NIH’s DNA studies on mitochondria fission proteins specifically, apoptosis protein expression, purification, and cell biology as well as on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy methods.   The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Due to the benefits gained by NIH from Dr. Suzuki’s research efforts on the  mitochondria fission proteins study and in order to maintain continuity of the research, an award to any other source for this requirement would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Responses must reference synopsis number NHLBI-PS-2005-004 and must be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Building RKL2, Suite 6042, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention Ms. Cecilia Morales.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Cincinnati, OH, requires the services of a contractor to complete a study entitled "Mining Reclamation Sustainability Evaluations - Elkins Project." The Elkins Project was a coal mine reclamation  study conducted in the late 1960's jointly by the US Bureau of Mines and the predecessor agencies to the USEPA. The final report is available from the National Technical Information Service. Addition studies have been performed by the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources. The study  involved regrading of surface mines, mine sealing, and revegetation along the Roaring Creek and Grassy Run watersheds near Elkins, WV.  The study evaluated the effect of the reclamation practices on water quality in the watersheds and on biotic diversity.  It has been over thirty years since the  Elkins Project was completed.  It is the intent of this study to return to the Elkins project and assess the sustainability of the reclamation efforts performed.  This will require an assessment of current conditions, both in terms of 1) water quality and flow, 2) diversity of the surviving grasses  and trees, 3) diversity of aquatic life, and 4) general assessment of the effectiveness of the reclamation /mine sealing efforts. The contractor shall compare the current conditions with similar unmined locations in the nearby or adjacent areas to assess the degree of return to the natural  environment.  Similarly, the contractor shall compare the current conditions with those at the completion of the Elkins Study.  Water samples will be collected by the contractor, preserved appropriately, and provided to the EPA NRMRL laboratory for analyses. All analyses will be completed by EPA  and the results returned to the contractor within 30 days.  All field measurements (e.g., flow, pH, conductivity, temperature) will be performed by the contractor, who will be required to submit a QA/QC plan to EPA for review.  No sampling can be done without an approval from EPA of the QA/QC plan.  QA requirements are in Attachment A. The study shall be conducted in May or June 2005. The contractor shall provide a final report acceptable to EPA and photographic documentation of site conditions by September 30, 2005. This acquisition is designated as a small business set aside under NAICS  code 541710. The acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is anticipated that a Request For Quotation (RFQ) will be issued on or about November 23, 2004. To receive a copy of the RFQ, interested firms must submit a written request to Mr. Josh Bowers  (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) by 10:00 AM EST MONDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2004. Requests submitted via email are preferred or a fax is acceptable. The fax number is 513-487-2109. Requests must include company name, mailing address, fax number, and email address.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's  (EPA)  plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Southern Florida to provide professional services for the project titled, "Development of Time Dependent Models."  Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant  to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiation without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.   The basis for this determination is that the U.S. EPA-National Center for Environmental Assessment has a requirement to continue the development of  effective statistical methods and computer implementation to the BMDS software for risk assessment of behavioral neurotoxicity data and other continuous, time-dependent data.  The University of Southern Florida is the only known source that can provide professionals with the unique expertise and  extensive experience in analyzing neurotoxicity screening data, dose-response modeling and benchmark dose computation and software development.  Therefore the EPA has determined that a contract with the University of Southern Florida is appropriate under the current conditions stated above.   This  notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to Kimberli Irwin at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2109 or by e-mail (irwin.kimberli.epa.gov)  which establishes that their specifications meet the EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Amendment 001 Submitted 1/5/04

The following information is provided as clarification.  Please be reminded that all proposals must be submitted through ITSS and that the closing date will be November 12, 2004, 12:00 pm PST.
 
Question #1

SOO Requirement 3.1.6 states that, "The Internet connections shall support the use of CheckPoint SecuRemote VPN software for secure connections to the FOH WAN."

Is it correct to assume that FOH has a CheckPoint firewall solution in place and will provide each end user (needing VPN connectivity to the FOH WAN) with the CheckPoint SecuRemote VPN software to all end users at the proposed sites, or does this need to be provided as part of the task?  Will FOH be providing CheckPoint firewalls to any of the proposed sites, or will all VPN connections to the FOH WAN be based upon end user SecuRemote VPN software from the desktop?

Response # 1:

1. FOH has it's own checkpoint firewall. Very few of the sites will be using VPN, and those that do will be using SecuRemote clients from the desktop.

Question #2

SOO Requirement 3.1.4 states that : "The Contractor shall identify and
provide all equipment (e.g. DSL modems, broadband cables, firewalls,
routers, etc) required to establish a connection from the FOH site to the internet.  The Contractor shall provide a standard firewall/router device correctly configured to allow multiple computers to share the high-speed connection. The Contractor may propose an "integrated"
modem/firewall/router devices which meet all technical specifications in this SOO."

What type of firewall is required at each site (i.e. IP filtering, stateful inspection, etc.), and will it be the responsibility of the contractor to manage (configure and maintain the configuration of) that firewall?

Response # 2:

2. The firewall that we are requesting can be a simple firewall/router (like a Linksys) that are appropriate for home or SOHO applications. We'd like the vendor to do the initial baseline configuration on the firewall. FOH will manage the firewall configuration after that.

Question #3

SOO requirement page 1, Preamble: states that  the objective is to award a contract for "high speed digital internet access"  and goes on to list DSL, broadband cable and satellite as source examples.  Throughout the rest of the SOO in multiple places the requirement clearly emphasizes a preference for "... DSL solutions wherever possible" (ref parag 2.4).  For bid evaluation purposes will GSA further clarify if this FOH requirement is primarily for HS internet access product/services wherein DSL is just one of the delivery options or if it is primarily for HS internet access delivered by DSL.

Response # 3:

3. The preference is for DSL for support purposes. If a particular site is not eligible for DSL, we will look at the other alternatives. At present, we are not allowed to consider wireless.

Question #4

RFQ Requirement, page 6 of 20, Instructions for Submitting Your Quote, Parag c :  States that the page limitation for the technical/capability proposal is 20 page.  This same section calls for a draft quality control plan to be finalized after contract award.  Please confirm that the draft QA plan submittal with the proposal is NOT included in the 20 page count.

Response # 4:

The draft quality control plan is NOT include in the 20 page count.

Question #5

Requirement "Phase 2 Sites" listing: The list below identifies addresses from your locations table that we cannot qualify in our system.  Normally this means that the address is either incomplete or incorrect. Can you please clarify the site specific data at each of the below listed locations?

Question #6

We do intend to submit an offer and are working diligently to complete the proposal.  However, answers to our questions are necessary, so that we may fully define all equipment requirements, complete negotiations with local carriers in varying stages of DSL deployment, and to finalize firm fixed price costs such as negotiated antenna rights. Understanding it does not negatively impact the roll out schedule, will GSA grant a two week extension to the due date?

Response #6:

The solicitation closing date remains unchanged at November 12, 2004, 12:00 pm PST. All proposals must be submitted through ITSS.

<SUBJECT>20--DEVELOP A LARGE APERTURE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE HULL ARRAY FOR SUBMARINE SONARS
<SOLNBR>N0002405R6302
<CONTACT>Steven D. Williams, 202-781-3962.  Contracting Officer, James R. Watts, 202-781-3958!!
<DESC>The Government is developing large aperture active and passive hull arrays for submarine sonars to supplement or replace existing systems.  This effort is developing state-of-the-art arrays and signal-processing techniques that will take advantage of the large horizontal and vertical apertures provided by these arrays.  Specific goals of the effort are: (1) To take advantage of the vertical distribution of ambient noise. (2) To provide accurate signal arrival path direction in horizontal and vertical    dimensions. (3) To be compatible with Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (A-RCI) and VIRGINIA-Class submarine non-propulsion electronics systems.  (4) To require small footprints and low heat generation. (5) To build and install arrays at a cost less than $500/channel.   Supporting this developmental effort, the Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS5) in Washington, DC is soliciting proposals for:  (1)	Innovative large aperture active and/or passive hull arrays designs.  (2) Innovative ideas for small footprint, small thickness, moderate power, low cost (<$100/channel) mid and high frequency broadband projectors.  (3) New approaches for constructing large aperture hull array acoustic baffles.  (4) Advanced decoupling materials necessary to optimize performance (e.g., materials with frequency-selective transmissivity). (5) The design and development of an electrical infrastructure that includes both outboard (i.e., low-cost small acoustic sensors with directional response) and inboard electronics. (6) The manufacturing production, integration and installation of a large aperture hull array Advanced Development Model (ADM) or prototype.   (7) High-sensitivity T&E measuring, recording and data analysis equipment needed to support any of the above efforts.   The expected result of this BAA is affordable, high performance sonar systems including low power electronic infrastructure and a processing system that will enable the design, development and integration of a large aperture hull array into the overall submarine sonar suite.   PROPOSALS Proposals may be submitted in the form of a Formal Proposal (described below) or White Paper (described later).  White Papers will be evaluated, and if it is in the best interests of the Government and sufficient funds are available, a Formal Proposal will be requested.

QUESTION NO. 44:  While the Passive MDNS section makes allowances for providing improvements to the Rail Interface System, the Active MDNS for which we plan to submit makes no allowances for an improved RIS.  It would appear to be in the Government's best interests to not limit manufacturers to similarly submit improvements to the RIS under the Active MDNS subsystem as well.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 44:  Manufacturers are free to submit proposals on any of the nine subsystems or any combination thereof.  The division of subsystems into active and passive groups was for organizational purposes only and was not intended to imply that proposals be submitted for the entire group. QUESTION NO. 45:  Section 3.3 SOPMOD Technology Requirements describes "Supplemental specifications" as existing capabilities, however late r under 3.3.2 Group B Active Miniature Day / Night Subsystems the "Supplemental Specifications are termed as minimum performance characteristics, i.e. threshold requirements.  This appears to be a conflict.  It is our interpretation the Supplemental specifications are not threshold requirements for this solicitation.   If these Supplemental specifications contained within the draft solicitation are considered threshold characteristics, they are limiting and overly restrictive.  For examples there are numerous supplemental specifications specifying the exact type of switch based on the existing hardware, the exact location of a switch based on the existing hardware, etc.  These overly restrictive specifications include but are not limited to sections 3.3.2.1.2.2 Switching Devices, Section 3.3.2.1.2.9  makes no allowances for the desire and ability to combine hardware as specifi ed in the ORD (See Wilcox comment 3), 3.3.2.2.2.3.2 Illumination Laser Beam Divergence, 3.3.2.2.2.6 Mode Switch, 3.3.2.2.2.8 Adjusters, 3.3.2.2.2.11 (makes no allowances for combining hardware as in ORD), 3.3.2.3.2.2 Switching Devices, etc.   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 45:  The specification that will be published with the solicitation has been updated to include designation of KPP’s.  The supplemental specifications not designated as KPP’s are tradable. QUESTION NO. 46:  SOPMOD M4 ORD specifically states the visible laser pointer, visible bright light, infrared pointer and infrared illuminator can be integrated into a single active modular aiming device or a visible and an IR module.  While we have reviewed the draft solicitation, it does not appear to make allowances for the Enhancement of combining all the devices into one system. ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 46:  See Performance  Specification (Para. 3.2.15) 3.

<CONTACT>Don Ellison 812-854-5774
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes an amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 published on 27 March 2002.  This amendment is intended to alert industry of changes in requirements, schedule, and acquisition strategy previously identified in N00164-02-R-0014   This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about July of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental and production items.  In response to market research and user inputs, these may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) with some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optim ized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices have exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators.  These MDNS sub-systems have four-fold mission.  MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summariz ed below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems are listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired: Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (3) ACOG Reflex Sight (4) ACOG 4X Sight (5) Backup Iron Sight (6) Rail Interface System A(1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):   The CNVD integrates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather tharagraphs.  4) Paragraph 3.2.21 Exterior Finish:  The requirement for exterior finish was changed from flat dark gray to taupe.  Note: Product samples for the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations are exempt from this requirement.  5) Paragraph 3.3.1.1.1.2.2  Reticle:  Threshold and objective ranges were added to the ballistic compensating reticle.  6) Paragraph 3.3.1.1.1.2.4   Eye Relief:  The ECOS eye relief has been corrected to read 1.4 inches to 3.0 inches.  7) Paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.1.3  Weight:  The CNVD Objective Weight requirement was raised to 22 ounces.  8) Paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.2.1  Scope Compatibility:  The CNVD Scope compatibility table was changed to all APPs.  9) Paragraph 3.3.2.1.1.1.4 Battery Removal:  The requirement for batteries to be able to be replaced by the operator with one hand, without using tools, and without removing the MDNS subsystem from the host weapon was deleted for the VBL III.  10) Paragraph 3.4.1.3 Electromagnetic Performance Parameters:  This paragraph was improperly labeled 3.4.2.  Additionally, the Table was incorrectly identified.  11) Paragraph 3.4.2 Environmental Requirements:  Minor errors were corrected.  Also, the requirement for a MIL-STD-810 Rain Test were removed.  12) Paragraph 3.4.4 Fi ring Schedules:  A clause was added to allow for simulated weapon shock/recoil using shock profiles to be used to validate this requirement.

<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes the second amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 originally published on 27 MAR 2002 and amended on 28 JUN 2002.  This second amendment is being issued in response to questions received from industry concerning the DRAFT Performance Specification for pending solicitation number N00164-02-R-0014.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on 16 OCT 2002. The formal solicitation has not yet been issued. 2.  INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS:   References cited in this amendment are from revision Preliminary 10 of the draft Performance Specification dated 21 June 2002.  The applicable questions and answers are as follows: QUESTION NO. 1:    3.2.12 Are DL-123 batteries acceptable for Group B Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1:  The performance s pecification neither requires nor precludes the use of any specific battery; however, any battery chosen must be common and commercially available. QUESTION NO. 2:  3.2.15 Is an “all in one package” more desirable than the modular approach currently utilized? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 2:   Any proposed “all-in-one” solution must meet all of the KPP’s for each of the subsystems it is combining.  APP’s are, by definition, tradable.  Combined systems will be evaluated based on risks and benefits that the solution will provide the operator.  An all-in-one solution may or may not be more desirable.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 3:     3.3.2.1.2.8  At what point does the VBL become too bright?   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 3:  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) specifies  a minimum range of visible illumination, but does not include any specifications for luminosity.  Life Cycle Sustainment costs will be considered during the source selection process; therefore, the systems should be designed to be as efficient as possible and still meet the performance specifications. QUESTION NO. 4:    3.3.2.2.2.1 Is the “double tap” feature of the AN/PEQ-2 Pressure Pad acceptable for a constant  on function?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 4:  The ORD has not changed since the AN/PEQ-2 was fielded.  Improvements on the current design will be considered.  A “double tap” feature may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 5:    3.3.2.2  Is a high-power illuminating (100 mw output) laser desired for sniper applications?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 5:  Sniper applications for infrared pointing, illuminating, and aiming capability are not within the scope of the upcoming solicitation.  There is no requirement for a 100mw laser; however, specific applications for pointing out to 5km in limited quantities are anticipated as separated contract line items.  The performance specification will be updated to reflect this requirement. QUESTION NO. 6:    3.3.2.2.2.6 Is there a requirement for an IR Illuminator only mode?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 6:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.2.6) QUESTION NO. 7:    3.3.2.2.2.8 Are low profile adjusters acceptable/preferred as currently incorporated into the  AN/PEQ-2 Model 5000?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 7:  Adjusters will be evaluated on several criteria including, but not limited to, ease of operat ion, snag hazards, glove accessibility, etc.  Low-profile adjusters may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 8:    3.3.2.3.24  8a. The laser wavelength of 630 +/- 15nm (Red) is specified.  Is Green 535nm acceptable?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 8a:  The wavelength spec

<DESC>This is Amendment 0002 for a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that was originally issued on 20 February 2003 and is hereby amended as follows: A.  The time by which offers must be received is changed from 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. (The closing date, 21APR03, is unchanged.) B.  In Addendum 2 to the solicitation, Page 1 of 5 is corrected to change Item 0000 to Item 0009. C.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the first sentence of Paragraph A.3. is deleted and replaced by the following two sentences:  Separate proposals are required for each MD/NS subsystem being proposed.  Variants within each subsystem may be proposed within that subsystem proposal.  Each proposal shall include five (5) copies of Volume 1 and two (2) copies of Volume 2, 3 and 4. D.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the second sentence of Parag raph D is deleted and replaced by the following: If the offeror is a small business, this volume shall describe the extent to which your company has identified and committed to provide for participation by small, small and disadvantaged businesses (SDB), woman owned businesses (WOB), historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institutions for the performance of this effort.  The Offeror shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the tasks assigned the selected small and/or SDB and WOB subcontractors are meaningful in the sense that they will be performing functions important to the overall success of the program and also broaden the subcontractor's technical capability.   The offeror shall describe their management approach for enhancing small, SDB and WOB subcontractor's technical capability.   Of special interest is the amount and type of  work to be performed by the subcontractors.  The offeror shall explain the reasons for and advantages of selecting particular subcontractors. E.  The solicitation states that “Initial inspection of the required supplies shall be performed by the cognizant DCMA and/or NSWC personnel at the contractor’s/sub-contractor’s facility.  Final inspection and acceptance shall be at NSWC Crane.”  This statement applies to all deliveries on the future contracts including prototypes and production hardware. F.  Additional details concerning the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations (as set forth in Addendum 3) are as follows: Oral Presentation/Demonstration:  Formal scheduling of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The Government will notify each offeror of the date and time of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration at least two  weeks prior to the scheduled date.  The number of offeror representatives for each Oral Presentation/Demonstration shall not exceed six.  In order to facilitate the source selection process, the Government intends to schedule the Oral Presentation/Demonstration by MDNS subsystem rather than by offeror.  Offerors shall have up to 2 hours to present Powerpoint presentations, conduct any product demonstrations, and allow for a question and answer period.  It is anticipated that it will be possible for offerors to conduct limited operational demonstrations of passive devices, visible bright lights, and Class 3A lasers.  The Government is currently investigating the possibility of more detailed demonstrations at a range yet to be determined.   G.  The changes below have resulted in a revised Statement of Work (SOW) and Performance Specification, which are attached and available  for downloading.  The SOW and Performance Specification were originally published as Addendum 1, Section 2 and Addendum 1, Section 3 of the solicitation.  The information shown below is only a summary of the changes made to the attached SOW and Performance Specification. STATEMENT OF WORK CHANGES: 1) Paragraph 3.2.4 Operator’s Manual:  Paragraph title renamed and simplified to reference MIL-PRF-63016B(TM), which is consistent with the Performance Specificat

All required information must be received on or before 31OCT2003, 3:00 PM  Eastern Standard Time. Mr. Ellison may be contacted at 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095, or E-mail address  ellison_db@crane.navy.mil .  an a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SO PMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability  costs, improved reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high  humidity, reduced snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.   A(5)  Backup Iron Sight: implementation of day and night sighting capabilities with an emphasis on light emission control, improved capability to maintain the set position in a combat environment, integration of short and long range capability with improved durability over existing inserts, and reduced snag hazards.  A(6) Rail Interface System:  incorporation of design features which improve overall system performance (possibly floating barrel design concept), improved cleaning and maintenance, improved the durability, and production cost reduction. Group B, Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (3) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that  provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(3) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired.  The SOPMOD P rogram desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this capability into a unified system. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives:  Increased user acceptance to include (1) Improved Operation Suitability to include improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  The overall objective is increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions. (2)  Mini aturization, to include reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of firing. (3)  Increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, and ease of cleaning. (4)  Recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms.  Fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective. (5) Functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions. (6) Incorporation of improved safety features. (7) Low optical retro-reflection augmentation. (8) Improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions. (9) Improved lens protection, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers. (10) Improved eye relief whi ch provides optimum performance for SOF combat scenarios and host weapons. (11) Decreased life-cycle support costs. (12)  Improved power consumption, where applicable. (13) Incorporation of night vision capability where it currently does not exist. (14) Improved boresight retention. (15) Consolidation of current capabilities into multi-use systems.  This includes the integration of technologies currently fielded by multiple systems into single multi-use systems and utilization of modular technology, where such combinations are suitable for SOF combat. (16) Improved safety. 5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method. Items will be selected on a "Best Value" Contracting basis. IDIQ contracts will be awarded to offerors in accordance with the following plan: (A)  RCO Solicitation is to be published in July 200 2.  The RCO Solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Be advised that a DRAFT VERSION of the Performance Specification for the proposed procurement is available at the following web link:  http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/02R0014/02R0014.htm .  It is requested that this DRAFT Solicitation be reviewed by interested parties and provide any comments or questions to the Technical Point of Contract (Barry Gatewood) as identified in Paragraph 7 below by July 19, 2002. (B)  Solicitation is planned to close in August 2002.   Upon the closure date and time of the solicitation, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  Functional samples to be u sed during the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations will be delivered prior to commencement of the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.   (C)  Upon closure of the solicitation, a Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Team (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  An SSB Chairman will be assigned by the SSA to chair the SSB.  All members of the Source Selection Board shall be required to file a Certificate of Non-Disclosure prior to being given access to any of the source selection sensitive material.  A Test Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) will be appointed by the Source Selection Authority (SSA).  The TERP Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.  The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting s cores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.   Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains technical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.  The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Ve ndors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  (D)  Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB will require demonstrations, to include functional demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Representatives from the user community will be asked to participate.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct an adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source  Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award(s).  In order to avoid unreasonable government test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found. (E)  Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.  Product samples are required to comply with key performance parameters (KPP) delineated in the solicitation.  Offerors who submit product samples that do not comply with the KPPs will not be further evaluated.  The samples must meet or exceed the stated thresholds.  These test results and comments will be submitted to the Technical Evaluation Review Panel (TERP). Developmental Testing (DT) will be conducted at NSWC Crane on the product samples to determine compliance with the KPPs, and environmental requirements, and safe to conduct further testing.  Operational Testing (OT) will be conducted by an Independent Validation/Verification Agent.  During OT the operators will determine if the samples meet or exceed the stated thresholds, meet combat suitability and combat effectiveness.  No offerors will be allowed to participate in the OT.  Representatives of the Contracting Officer from NSWC Crane will evaluate offeror(s) past performance and price proposals.  The price evaluation will be presented to the Contracting Officer.  The past performance evaluation will be presented to the TERP. The Contracting Officer/SSA shall use the recommendations and conclusions from the TERP, to include DT and OT analysis, contract management eval uation, past performance, and price evaluations, to derive negotiation strategies and an award determination which will be documented in business clearance memoranda in accordance with the Naval Acquisition Procedure Supplement and NSWC Crane quality assurance guidelines.  The goal is to utilize the same contract vehicles awarded prior to DT/OT for production hardware after this final down-select. 6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.

<CONTACT>Mark Ross at 850-235-5624, or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The original synopsis has been modified in its entirety as follows: The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) to Magneto Inductive Systems Limited (MISL) USA of San Bernardino, CA on a sole source basis for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and production phases of the Magneto Inductive-Remote Activation Munitions System (MI-RAMS) program. The effort will include LRIP planning, long lead item procurement, and the manufacture, inspection, test and delivery of MI-RAMS. The government anticipates a period of performance for five years under an ID/IQ contract. The first year of the effort will involve LRIP planning such as long lead item identification for the production of the MI-RAMS system currently being developed under a sole source contract to MISL, Nova S cotia. The follow on years will involve procurement of long lead items and the manufacture of the MI-RAMS hardware. The MI-RAMS is a lightweight, compact, man-portable magneto inductive transmitter and receiver system to be used by Special Operation forces (SOF) and combat engineers. MI-RAMS provides the capability to remotely control the detonation of demolition charges or to remotely operate other items of equipment such as beacons, laser markers, weapons, ground marking lights, etc. MI-RAMS will reliably propagate a signal through natural or manmade media such as water, earth or building structures. The MI-RAMS will operate in all environments such as arctic, tropic, temperate, urban, beach zone and the surf zone (littoral) to depths less than 10 feet. The planned start date for this effort will be 4QFY04. The acquisition objective is for up to 5000 each MI transmitters, 10, 000 Auxiliary Power Packs, 25,000 each MI Type A receivers, 50,000 Type B MI  receivers. Detailed tasks will be provided, defining the required efforts, in individual delivery orders issued under the ID/IQ contract. This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), as applied in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), is deemed applicable as the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies available from Magneto Inductive Systems Ltd, the only known supplier of magneto-inductive (MI) related technologies. NSWC-PC has determined that MISL is only known supplier of MI related technologies that can meet the operational requirements of the MI-RAMS program. This determination was based on the results of 29 market surveys conducted by CSS/ONR since 1993 that resulted in no responses other than MISL. The M I-RAMS cannot be procured competitively utilizing a technical data package. Currently the patents and intellectual property rights to the relevant MI technologies either belong solely to MISL or are Government patents licensed to MISL. Additionally, per the approved MI-RAMS program Acquisition Plan, the LRIP and production quantities will be acquired from the system developer. MISL is the sole developer of MI-RAMS. NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees (based on NAICS Code 334290). FSC is 5895.

<DESC>This is Modification Number 4 to the ISAT Broad Agency Announcement on 30 September 04.  Add the following for clarification:  BAA section 2.C.1, 1) Level of effort on Objective System analysis in next phase.  We are expecting a similar level of effort on OSC as PDR (up to $1.5M, not 15%). However the intent is different. On the calibration and metrology side DARPA expects the OSC design to evolve, reflecting the lessons learned from the breadboards and testing etc performed in the FDS CDR phase. On the radar side the contractors should consider $500k the MAXIMUM level of effort, as needed to ensure that they understand the operational concepts.  

Add the following for clarification: BAA section 2.C.2, 2) Intent of the BAA is to be as close to a true CDR as possible.  We are expecting close to 85% released engineering on the core experimental parts (structure, metrology ...). On the other pieces (bus, solar arrays) we are hoping for as much legacy hardware as possible, and as much released engineering as possible.  The KTR proposals should identify any items not met from a true CDR and the plans and cost (in planning estimate) to recover in the following manufacturing phase contract.  Any deltas from a true CDR will be evaluated per the BAA "ability and adequacy to retire risk..." category.

<ARCHDATE>01142005
<CONTACT>Teresa L. Lukavec, (703) 325-6172
<DESC>This notice is to give an update to the Army Knowledge Online Enterprise Services (AKO-ES) acquisition and provide instructions for due diligence. The following is the estimated schedule for the upcoming AKO-ES events: RFP Release:						approximately mid-November Commencement of Due Diligence period	1 week after RFP release or 29 Nov                                           2004 (whichever is later) Due Diligence Period			1 day per vendor DUE DILIGENCE It is well understood by the Army that the more competitors understand the Armys objectives, plans and operations, the more likely they are to submit superior solutions.  The due diligence process allows prospective offerors to gain a better understanding  of key organization mission objectives and existing conditions. 	a.  Phases of the Due Diligence Process.  The Due Diligence process will be conducted in two phases.  First, to provide access to information related to this acquisition, the establishment of a virtual reading room will occur not later than release of the  RFP.  	(1)  Virtual Reading Room. 		A virtual reading room will be established on the AKO web site for prospective offerors who desire to review documentation relevant to this solicitation.  All items posted in the virtual reading room are for Information Only and not considered part of the RFP. 		Offerors must include a request for a guest account on the AKO with their confirmation submittal (see paragraph (2) b.)  The Contracting Officer will forward account related information to the AKO sponsor who will activate the account.  Once accounts are  activated, the Contracting Officer will notify all offerors of their individual AKO e-mail address, a link to the AKO web site, and the path to the virtual library, as well as constraints while in the AKO portal.  All guest accounts will be deactivated on  that date of contract award.  Only one AKO guest account will be given per confirming prime offeror. 	(2)  One-on-One Sessions. 		a.  The one-on-one sessions will follow the principles identified by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.201, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposals.  A major objective of this session is to provide confirming offerors and their tea m members the ability to ask questions specific to their unique solutions that, by their very nature, they would not ask if the response were to be posted and provided to their competition.  As such, if the confirming offeror notifies the Government that t he questions it intends to ask during the one-on-one sessions are proprietary and whose release would identify confidential business strategies, or approaches, the questions and responses will be protected and held confidential. 		The confirming offeror teams will be given the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the team of Army representatives with knowledge of the current environments to better understand the Armys underlying mission and technical environment.  The purpose of t hese meetings is to allow confirming offerors a means to obtain and clarify information without disclosing proprietary or business confidential information to competitors. 	b.  Confirmation of Intent to Participate in Due Diligence.  Each offeror (i.e., prime contractor) intending to submit a proposal will confirm its participation in the AKO-ES acquisition via e-mail to the attention of Janet Spaulding, Contract Specialist at  AKO-ES@itec4.army.mil no later than 2:00 p.m., EST, 15 November 2004. The confirmation will include the following information to enable the Government to effectively coordinate the due diligence:  (1) the offerors due diligence point of contact (name, telephone number, and e-mail address); (2) a roster of attendees to inclu de company name and representative name (limited to 10); (3)  AKO guest account request to include the individuals full name that should receive the account access; (4) key areas of interest; (5) any additional inform ation the offeror deems necessary (e.g., handicap access requirements); and (6) interest in visiting the AKO Primary site (Note:  All attendees at the Primary Site must have a Secret Security Clearance).  Please submit evidence of such clearance with the  confirmation notice if interested in visiting the AKO Primary site.  Such evidence may be faxed to (703) 428-1685 if it is not possible to e-mail.  Please ensure that each page of the fax appropriately identifies the company name and the individuals name .  Timely submission of the confirmation is required to facilitate the establishment of session dates. 	The confirmed offeror teams due diligence point of contact will be notified by e-mail of the date, time, location, and other specifics of its one-on-one session.  Sessions will be selected by using a lottery process.  Notification of sessions will be pro vided at least three working days before the scheduled due diligence session.  Offerors are advised that employees of the incumbent AKO contractor, CherryRoad Technologies, Inc., and other support contractors perform functions at the AKO Primary site and, therefore, will be present during any site visits.   	c.  Request for Clarification (RFC).  All requests for RFP clarification will be accepted during the due diligence period.  RFCs shall be submitted to the ITEC4 Contracting Officer at AKO-ES@itec4.army.mil.  RFCs that result in specific information nece ssary to submit proposals will be provided to all confirming offerors via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) web site as an amendment to the RFP.  Such information may also be posted to the virtual reading room so that confirming offerors have the inf ormation prior to a formal amendment being issued.  Therefore, questions/comments shall not include a restrictive legend and shall not include proprietary information.  No pre-proposal conference is planned.   	The Government will provide competing offerors equal access to data and information.  The Government assumes no responsibility for any representation made by any of its officers or agents during due diligence.  Offeror questions and Government responses f urnished during due diligence are considered to be unofficial.  PARTICIPATION OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS. 	a.  Offerors are advised that the commercial firms identified below will assist the Government in providing acquisition support during the due diligence.  These firms will be authorized access to the discussions conducted during the one-on-one sessions. These firms are expressly prohibited from competing on the subject acquisition.

<SOLNBR>N0016402R0014
<RESPDATE>060102
<CONTACT>Donald Ellison, Contracting Officer, 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about April or May of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental an d production items.  These may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), however previous market research indicates that all items of interest will require some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optimized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices ha ve exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators. MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summarized below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems ar e listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired…Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X SPR Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights, (2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (4) ACOG Reflex Sight (5) ACOG 4X Sight  A(1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights: improved day/night aiming capability, miniaturization, better resistance to fogging in rain and high humidity conditions, improved instantane ous sighting capabilities, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, improved stadiametric aiming capability (improved mil-dot/stadia line characteristics at all power settings), size and weight reductions, improved reticle illumination (illumination of entire reticle), reticle magnification to match scope power adjustments (first focal plane reticle), range and bullet drop compensation adjustments visible on the reticle both day and night, spirit level or cant indicator at base of reticle, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and lower power settings suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) operations.  Presently, there are no IDIQ contracts for 3.5X-10X SPR Riflescope Sights.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):  The CNVD integr ates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather than a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SOPMOD Program has  a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability costs, improved  reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high humidity, reduce d snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(5) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.  Group B, Activ e Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) Integrated Pointer/Illuminator Module (IPIM), (3) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (4) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) IPIM: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance/reflectivity of visible lasers against green and black targets, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.

(b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives: (1) increased User Acceptance to include: improved operational suitability, improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  Increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions (2) miniaturization, including reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of fir ing (3) increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, (4) fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective, (5) functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions (6) recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms (7) improved safety, (8) low optical augmentation retro-reflection, (9) improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers, (10) decreased life-cycle support costs.  5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method.  Items will be selected on a “Best Value” Contracting basis.  IDIQ contracts will be awarded t o offerors in accordance with the following plan:   (A) RCO Solicitation is to be published on or about April or May 2002.  The RCO solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Please do not respond to this advisory announcement until such time as the RCO solicitation is published.    (B) Solicitation is planned to close on or about May or June 2002.  Upon the closure date and time, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  A Source Selection Panel will evaluate the technical proposals, screening them to establish the competitive range.  A Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Tea m (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  A Test and Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.   The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting scores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.  Also, an SSB Chairman will be assigned by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) to chair the SSB.  Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains tech nical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.   The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Vendors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  This project seeks to field equipment in a time frame that is relevant to current conflicts.  Delivery of first articles is August 2002 (Objective), and March 2003 (Threshold).  Offerors of proposals found to be in the competitive range will be invited to renovate their proposals based on S SB findings, and to proceed to the next stage of competition, which will be Oral Presentation/Demonstration.   (C) Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted on or about June or July 2002, at a location to be announced.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors in the competitive range and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB may opt to require demonstrations, to include live-fire demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct a second adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award.  In order to avoid unreasonable governmen t test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found.   (D) Follow-on Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.   6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem  drawings.   7.

<DESC>The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is seeking information for Point of Sale (POS) vendors with the expertise necessary to possibly replace the current POS systems at all 273 military supermarkets (commissaries) worldwide.  DeCA will look for the “best value” POS system that supports standard industry grocery operations, adheres to industry and technical standards, is commercially proven, and reflects the current best practices for POS products.  The effort contemplated will cover the acquisition of all POS software and hardware, worldwide software and hardware maintenance, interfaces, site preparation, installation, testing, training, continuous-operation/power-conditioning equipment, documentation, technical support, consulting support services, operating supplies, checkstands, warranties, and technology enhancements that include upgrades of all hardware and software at appropriate intervals with the best practices in technology as well as user training in order to maintain parity with the commercial grocery industry.  Additional information can be obtained from the "business page" link at http://www.commissaries.com/ to include current store locations, operating hours, and other relevant data. Firms interested in participating in such an effort should provide a 2-15 page white paper that responds to the following queries to assist DeCA in formulating a follow-on Request For Proposal (RFP).  

1.	Company Profile.  Tell us about yourself and the type of POS experience and government procurement experience you possess.  Do your customers typically obtain equipment and hardware by purchasing, leasing, leasing with option to purchase, or by other means?  What is your experience in providing international solutions?

2.	POS Capabilities.

·	What are the typical front end and back office capabilities and related hardware/software that enables those capabilities.  Do those capabilities apply to any size store or is there a law of diminishing returns that you would recommend? 
·	Is your point of sale application capable of interfacing with a single sign-on solution without modification?   
·	Does your point of sale application currently use PKI-based authentication of system users?  How?  
·	What is your standard practice for printing SKU/UPC on receipts?
·	Does your system integrate Electronic Benefit Transfer, food stamps, and WIC at the point of sale?
 
3.	Key Performance Parameters.  How do you measure POS effectiveness and suitability – how do they relate to customer/operator efficiency?

4.	Technology trends.  What new capabilities within the past five years have provided the biggest ROI, are industry standards, and describe what you see as the industry trend over the next five years for technology incorporation into POS?  Do those capabilities apply to any size store or is there a law of diminishing returns that you would recommend? 

5.	Performance Based Incentives/Service Level Agreements.  

·	What has been your experience in performance-based delivery methods and techniques?  Describe you experience with performance-based and/or incentives-based contracts.   
·	What are the typical service level agreements for maintaining POS hardware and software capabilities and introducing new capabilities?
·	In the performance based area, how is the success of the entire system measured at the same time as a store operation?  Example:  The system could be 99% operational because large stores are online but the stores in Turkey could be offline.  Does your system provide measurements for the system as a whole and each individual store?  

6.   Interoperability and Customization.  

·	Describe your systems architecture in terms of Data, Services (web-based or other), Security, and Data Transport to obtain DoD net-centric and open systems compliance.   
·	Have you had to customize your POS system to establish interoperability with corporate business enterprise systems?  If so, please explain your POS functions that needed customization. 
·	What do you use as operating standards, ARTS, Net Centric, or other ISO standards?    Will your POS product support emerging industry standards for use of XML such as those being developed by ARTS or UCCnet?
·	The Department of Defense is advocating the use of extensible markup language (XML) for data exchanges within DoD, so DeCA is interested in the capability of COTS POS applications to support the use of XML.  Does your POS product currently support XML data exchanges? If not, do you plan to incorporate the use of XML within the next year? Do you plan to support evolving XML-related functionality such as web services for data transport/exchange?  
·	How do you validate your system prior to deployment or modification?

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt (Public Debt) is assessing the market to gain information for commercial, off-the-shelf, products or commercial services to support streamlining of an existing accounts payable system.  The Administrative Resource Center (ARC) processes accounts payable vendor invoice payments for a number of Federal agencies.  This is accomplished using the Oracle Federal Financials system, in addition to manual processes to evaluate, route, approve, receive, and monitor invoices to/from designated Contracting Officer’s Technical Representatives (COTRs) or invoice approvers, and storage of paper invoices and supporting documentation.

ARC is seeking ways to modernize its accounts payable processes.  We are seeking information from potential vendors with products or services that can help us accomplish the following improvements:

*	Convert paper documents to electronic documents upon receipt, or accept documents that are submitted in an electronic format, and work with electronic documents throughout the payment process from initial examination to storage.
*	Automate the collection of data from designated COTRs or invoice approvers.  Allow for flexibility in the information required for approval and provide a mechanism that the AP Department can provide additional information to facilitate the approval process.  
*	Automate the reminders to users needing to take action on a document.  Provide the functionality to allow for reminders to be sent to backup approvers or management officials.  
*	Provide e-mail notifications when action is requested of a user and allow for multiple approvals through the use of routing lists. 
*	Provide e-mail notifications back to the AP department when an invoice has been approved.
*	Generate status reports on documents in progress.
*	System should be accessible via the Internet and allow for restrictions by agency and user
*	Generate file to create invoices in the Oracle Federal Financials system, without re-keying data.
*	Reject documents that are not complete or do not meet financial system edits.

Additionally, the vendor must provide training for technical personnel and allow knowledge transfer for product maintenance.  In your response, please reference RFI-AP1.  ARC is requesting technical product literature that will demonstrate the vendor’s ability to meet the specified requirements, commercial price lists (if available), and references (agency name, point of contact, and phone number) only, at this time.  However, at ARC's option, evaluation software, product demonstrations, and/or technical presentations may be requested from vendors responding to this announcement.  Please note that this information is being requested for information and planning purposes only as ARC is primarily interested in assessing the viability of this technology.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested.  ARC will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received.  Dependent upon the results of this market survey, ARC may subsequently issue a solicitation to acquire the appropriate tool(s).  Any such solicitation would be based on a strictly functional statement of requirements in order to maximize competition.  Information sent in response to this request shall be addressed to Debra Stephenson, Administrative Resource Center, Procurement, 200 Third Street, UNB 4, Parkersburg, WV 26101 and received no later than December 6, 2004, 2:30 PM EST.

All variants need to function in  both semi-automatic and automatic firing modes, with the LMG primary firing  mode being full auto. The SC variant will provide Soldiers an enhanced close quarter battle  capability providing effective lethality through 150m.  The Carbine is slated  to be the standard issue individual combat weapon with an effective range  through 500m.  The DM variant will provide accurate fire at longer ranges as  well as offering an automatic rifle capability.  The LMG variant will offer the  role of suppressive fire through 600m.  The mandatory weapon system family requirements follow.  Any vendor not meeting  the following mandatory requirements may not be considered a potential source. ·	Multi-Configurable variants – 80% parts commonality between SC,  Carbine, and DM; 50% parts commonality between LMG and the other three  variants; reconfigurable at the unit level.   ·	Multi-Purpose Sighting System – Each variant shall include a resident  multi-purpose sight that enables the warfighter to rapidly and effectively  engage stationary and moving targets, both with reflexive fire at close ranges,  and with precision fire out to the maximum effective range of the variant (SC- 150m, Carbine-500m, DM-600m, LMG-600m).  For close range reflexive fire, the  sight shall enable the warfighter to acquire, engage, and hit a close range  (50m) target in less than 1.5 seconds.  ·	Accuracy – For soldier fired accuracy: SC (Moving Target) P(H) > .40 at  100m; Carbine (moving target) P(H) > .60 at 150m; DM (stationary w/ 500m zero) P (H) > .50 at 500m; LMG (first 6 round burst against a single E-type silhouette  in an 8 target array, zeroed to 300m) P(H) >.04 at 600m. ·	Reliability -– The Carbine, SC, and DM must demonstrate 18,000 Mean  Rounds Between Essential Function Failure (MRBEFF) for Class III malfunctions  (i.e., for non-operator correctable malfunctions which cause the loss of  essential functionality) and 2,300 MRBEFF for Class I and II malfunctions  combined (Class I malfunctions are operator clearable within 10 seconds,  whereas Class II malfunctions require more than 10 seconds to clear but can be  corrected by the operator with available equipment).  The LMG must demonstrate  18,000 MRBEFF for Class III malfunctions and 1,900 MRBEFF for Class I and II  malfunctions combined. ·	Back-up sight -– accurately engage targets out to 300 meters without  removal of the MPSS. ·	Boresight/Zero Repeatability -– The weapon system boresight/zero shall  be repeated when the OICW (Increment I) Limited Visibility Fire Control is  removed and reinstalled on the weapon. ·	Barrel Life -– All variants shall have a minimum barrel life no less  than 15,000 rounds. ·	Ammunition Compatibility -– The family of weapons shall use the same  ammunition.  Additionally, all variants must be able to fire standard NATO  issue ammunition (e.g., M855, MK 262). ·	Ambidexterity – All variants shall be ambidextrous with respect to:  fire mode selector switch, charging handle/forward assist, magazine release,  and bolt catch engagement.  Further, ejected cartridges shall not be channeled  in the rear direction to interfere with left handed shooters.   ·	Adjustable Stock – The adjustable stock shall accommodate the 5th –  95th percentile warfighter and be rugged enough to withstand the rigors of  individual movement techniques.

<SUBJECT>Request for Expressions of Interest
<DESC>In response to a solicitation issued on August 20, 2001 to conduct a â€œStudy of Potential Sites for the Deployment of New Nuclear Power Plants in the United Statesâ€, the Department of Energy received input from private sector firms that indicated interest in innovative uses of DOE property that could eventually lead to the construction of new commercial nuclear power plants in the United States.  The concept of using DOE controlled real property for siting new Generation III+ light water reactor nuclear plants is of interest to the Department as it continues to explore ways of working with the private sector to realize the vision stated in the National Energy Policy - to expand the use of nuclear energy in the U.S.  Pursuant to this goal, the Department would like to explore the level of industry interest in locating a Generation III+ commercial nuclear plant on leased federal property. The Department would like to receive proposed plans from interested U.S. electric utilities, power companies, or utility-led consortia that detail the proposed studies, activities, lease arrangements, or other measures the respondent believes would pave the way for the construction of a new advanced nuclear power plant on a DOE site.  It should be emphasized that this notice is not a commitment by the Department to take any specific action regarding the use of federal land for a commercial nuclear power plant.  Rather, it represents the first step in an exploratory process that will require the Department and the interested private firm to address and resolve a number of complex regulatory and legal issues prior to any decisions. No Federal funding will be provided under this announcement for the design, construction or operation of new nuclear power plants.  Interested parties should respond to this announcement within three weeks of the publication date.  All interested parties must demonstrate that they have the capabilities, experience and expertise to license, construct and operate a nuclear power plant. Companies must identify the proposed location for plant siting and/or future facilities.  Publication of this announcement does not commit the DOE to a specific course of action.  Responses should be sent to the attention of: Kenneth Chuck Wade, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology, 1000 Independence Ave. NE-30, SW Washington DC 20585.

The draft report is located on the NASA Exploration Systems Acquisition Portal url:  http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition/index.html In light of this draft report, we are seeking concepts, innovative approaches, and tools that will boost: NASA’s technical strength via infusion of external technology solutions (i.e., “spin-in” of outside technologies into NASA) and U.S. economic strength and public benefits through the transfer of NASA technology to create new products and services (i.e., “spin-out” of NASA technologies into the private/academic sector). The five basic elements of technology transfer at NASA are: (1) identifying/documenting available technologies as well as NASA’s technical needs, (2) evaluating/prioritizing these technologies/needs, (3) protecting NASA’s intellectual property, (4) performing active outreach to find potential partners, and (5) negotiating partnerships.  The five basic elements will still apply under the transformed model, but how we implement those functions will change.  We are seeking concepts, approaches, and tools to enable a more effective and efficient technology transfer program.  NASA is considering a more centralized approach to technology transfer in line with the NAPA recommendations and have developed a concept of how that centralized approach might work.  The concept is described in the white paper “Transformation of NASA’s Approach to Technology Transfer, Making the Most of the Innovative Partnerships Program”, which is located on the NASA Exploration Systems Acquisition Portal url:  http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition/index.html.  This approach may serve as the foundation for NASA’s future approach to technology transfer, but it may also be significantly altered in response to this Request for Information. For this Request for Information, NASA is interested in receiving white papers from all sources that address aspects of technology transfer and the appropriate organizational “transformed” structure and management approach.  Enclosed are the key focus areas, issues and suggested white paper topics.  White papers that examine one or more of the topics are invited.  Papers that address other important aspects in a manner consistent with the information requested below are also welcome.	White papers should be consistent with the January 14, 2004, U.S. Space Exploration Vision.  Innovative approaches are welcome, but should be reasonably achievable.  White papers should address the following Focus Areas and their associated Topics:  Focus Area 1 – Program Management;  Topics: Lessons Learned, Acquisition Strategy, Innovative Approaches, Effectiveness, Teaming Arrangements, Metrics.  Focus Area 2 – Tools and Methods;  Topics:  Innovative Use of Technology Transfer Industry, Low Cost Methods, Web-based Tools, Radically Different Practices, High-tech, Small Business Incubators, Leveraging of Federal, State, & Local Technology Transfer & Economic Development Efforts, Partnership Development, Licensing, Technology Infusion.      All documents should be delivered in electronic format using Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat by no later than 4:30 EST on December 01, 2004.  The white paper should not consist of more than five pages of text and three pages of graphics.  Any submittal that exceeds these page limits will not be reviewed.  All documents shall be delivered electronically to the following location: https://codet.nis.nasa.gov/Windchill/ExplorationPortal/ESRTIPPSubmit/  Point-of Contact (PoC) is:   Charlene Gilbert,   Innovative Partnerships Program,   Phone: 202.358.3992  Email: Charlene.gilbert-1@nasa.gov Each submission will receive an electronic notification of a successful upload.

<SUBJECT>99--NASA EXPLORATION SYSTEMS MISSION DIRECTORATE CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES DAY
<DESC>NASA EXPLORATION SYSTEMS MISSION DIRECTORATE CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES DAY At a special announcement event, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will present an overview of the Centennial Challenges program and an explanation of two Requests For Information (RFI) and one Announcement of Partnership Opportunity (APO) that will be released on November 5, 2004. The event will be conducted on November 15, 2004, at NASA Headquarters, James E. Webb Auditorium, 300 E Street SW, Washington DC from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. AGENDA - Introduction of Brant Sponberg - Welcoming Remarks - Introduction to Centennial Challenges - Description of RFI for Flagship and Keystone Challenge Support - Description of RFI for Quest Challenge Support - Description of APO for Co-Sponsorship and Alliance Challenges - Question and Answer Session - Adjournment BACKGROUND The objective of this event is to familiarize participants with the Centennial Challenges program, to describe the Request For Information (RFI) and Announcement of Partnership Opportunity (APO) documents that were released on November 5, 2004, and to respond to questions about these topics. Please note that the presentations will be unclassified and restricted in topic to Centennial Challenges and the released RFIs and APO. Both RFI documents are designed to solicit information pertaining to potential support contracts for future challenges that Centennial Challenges may conduct. Because it was felt that the challenges that focus on technology development (the "Flagship" and "Keystone" categories) would require sufficiently different support contracts than the challenges that focus on outreach (the "Quest" category), it was decided to release two separate RFIs instead of a single RFI for all challenges. In contrast to the RFIs, the APO document is looking for organizations who may want to contribute to or participate in Centennial Challenges activities. The APO has two distinct goals. 1. To identify potential Co-Sponsor Organizations interested in contributing cash towards the purse(s) for one or more prize competitions. 2. To identify potential Allied Organizations interested in making in-kind contributions toward the administration of one or more prize competitions. How an organization can offer to become a Co-Sponsor or an Allied Organization and the evaluation criteria NASA will use in the selection process of each is described in the APO. The Centennial Challenges Day will address questions and comments regarding the Centennial Challenges program, the Centennial Challenges competition categories  "Flagship", "Keystone", "Alliance", and "Quest"), and the content of the RFIs and APO documents mentioned above. NOTICE All Challenges are still in the formulation stage, and no final decision has been made on whether or not to initiate the Challenges described in the RFIs and APO. Decisions to issue specific Challenges and their rules will be determined at later dates. In some cases, these decisions are pending Congressional authorization for NASA to conduct large prize competitions. Before responses to these RFI and APO documents are received it is not possible to determine the specific number of challenges that will be adversely affected by the current lack of Congressional authority. WEBCAST If you are unable to attend this event, you can watch a live webcast or post-event streaming video from the Centennial Challenges web site at the following URL: http://realserver1.jpl.nasa.gov:8080/ramgen/encoder/hq04.rm The webcast link will become live on the morning of Monday, November 15, 2004.

<SUBJECT>B--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - NASA CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES PROGRAM SUPPORT CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES
<DESC>External organizations are sought to support Centennial Challenges (www.centennialchallenges.nasa.gov) within the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (www.exploration.nasa.gov) of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.  These organizations will help with the planning, coordination, and execution of the following elements as they relate to individual challenges: • Challenge Formulation • Co-Sponsor Recruitment • Competitor Recruitment • Challenge Administration • Challenge Publicity • Challenge Event Management It is expected that this effort will consist of one or more traditional, competitively bid contract(s).  This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to identify the field of possible supporting organizations based on the responses received and to obtain information that will help guide the development of future procurements.  Please respond to any or all of the RFI elements provided below. CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES OVERVIEW NASA Centennial Challenges was established to conduct prize competitions in support of the Vision for Space Exploration and ongoing NASA programs.  Centennial Challenges is modeled on past and ongoing prize competitions, including the 18th century British Longitude Prize; early 20th century aviation competitions, such as the Orteig Prize won by Charles Lindbergh; the ongoing Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge; and the recently won, privately funded, Ansari X PRIZE.  By making awards based on actual achievements instead of proposals, Centennial Challenges seeks novel and lower-cost solutions to engineering obstacles in civil space and aeronautics from new sources of innovation in industry, academia, and the public. CATEGORIES AND TYPES OF CHALLENGES NASA plans four categories of prize competitions under Centennial Challenges, two of which are covered in this RFI - Flagship Challenges and Keystone Challenges.  It is important to differentiate between these Challenge categories because each will make different demands on support functions.  The third and fourth Challenge categories, Alliance and Quest Challenges will be covered in separate documents.  The Alliance Challenge category will be covered in an Announcement of Partnership Opportunity.  The Quest Challenge category will be covered in a separate RFI. Individual Challenges will take one of two forms:  "first-to-demonstrate competitions", like the Longitude Prize, Orteig Prize, and X PRIZE; and "repeatable contests", like the DARPA Grand Challenge.	It is also important to differentiate between these types of Challenges because each will also make different demands on support functions. Flagship Challenges Flagship Challenges are intended to encourage external teams to independently design, develop, launch, and operate space missions and thereby generate innovative and/or low-cost approaches to various civil space goals that would not otherwise be pursued.  It is envisioned that all Flagship Challenges will be "first-to-demonstrate" competitions. NASA hopes to offer cash purses ranging from millions to tens of millions of dollars to the winners of individual competitions.  It should be noted that NASA must first obtain and is currently seeking necessary legislative authority to offer such large cash prizes. Flagship Challenges will be open to competitors from private sector companies, non-profit research institutions, university researchers, student teams, hobbyists, and any combination thereof.  Examples of Flagship-type prize competitions include the Orteig Prize and the X PRIZE.	Candidate Flagship Challenges under consideration by NASA include prize competitions for: • A soft robotic lunar landing,  • A micro reentry vehicle,  • An aero-assist demonstration, and • A station-keeping solar sail. Keystone Challenges Keystone Challenges are intended to encourage the development and demonstration of advanced technologies and/or innovative capabilities that support NASA's mission areas, and, where possible, have strong synergy with other applications.  Keystone Challenges may be component-, subsystem-, or system-level demonstrations, and may involve robotic contests, drop tests, and/or atmospheric flight tests.	 Depending on the technical goal, Keystone Challenges may take the form of "first-to-demonstrate competitions" or "repeatable contests", and hopes to offer cash purses ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to the winners of individual Challenges. As noted above, NASA must first obtain and is currently seeking necessary legislative authority to offer such large cash prizes.   Keystone Challenges will also be open to private sector companies, non-profit research institutions, university researchers, student teams, hobbyists, and any combination thereof.  The Longitude Prize and the DARPA Grand Challenge are two examples of Keystone-type prize competitions.  Candidate Keystone Challenges under consideration by NASA include: "First-to-demonstrate competitions" for: • Lightweight radiation shielding, • A mobile power storage breakthrough, • Improved and new physical and chemical lunar resource processing techniques, • An advanced astronaut glove, • An autonomous drill, • An autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for cargo, • A long-duration, station-keeping UAV, and • A hybrid airship. "Repeatable contests" for: • Advances in materials, especially nanotube tethers; • Advances in lightweight power transmission, especially beamed power; • Advances in deployable telescope technology, especially those that could be applicable to space-based observatories; • Advances in general aviation technologies, especially those applicable to other modes of air transport; • A precision landing system; • An advanced tele-robotic construction system; • Highly mobile and cooperative autonomous robots; and • A human lunar all-terrain vehicle. SUBMISSION DETAILS Given the background provided above, describe your organization's experiences, capabilities, and ideas for supporting Flagship and Keystone Challenges.  Where a more complete set of support functions can be provided, partnering between organizations is encouraged.  Joint submissions between two or more potential partnered organizations are welcome. Attachment A provides a description of the anticipated support functions for Flagship and Keystone Challenges. Attachment B provides a list of general questions regarding follow-on procurements to this RFI, which may be used to structure future procurements for Flagship and Keystone Challenge contract support. Your organization's submission may be used by the Government to determine the degree of interest in the industry and capabilities for planning purposes. Submissions to this request shall be limited to no more than 15 pages, including attachments, and should be made electronically in the body of or as an attachment to an email sent to Rhett.A.Herrera@nasa.gov.  All submissions must be received by December 17, 2004 at 5:00 p.m. EDT. Questions regarding this RFI should be directed to: Ken Davidian NASA Headquarters 300 E Street, SW Washington, DC	20546-0001 Tel.:  (202) 358-0748 ATTACHMENT A: SUPPORT FUNCTIONS FOR FLAGSHIP AND KEYSTONE CHALLENGES Challenge Formulation The Challenge Formulation function involves working with NASA and non-NASA groups to develop and review rules and other details of individual Challenges.  Although the Centennial Challenges Manager will be responsible for final approval of Challenge rules, it is anticipated that support contractor(s) will play a significant role in guiding the formulation of individual Challenges from initial concept to final rules release.  NASA anticipates that support contractor(s) will be especially involved in: • Gathering ideas for Challenges through internal NASA surveys, external workshops, and other inputs; • Defining and refining individual Challenge candidates selected by NASA through competitor inputs and independent reviews; • For Challenges that take the form of "repeatable contest events", identifying and evaluating potential event locations (such as test ranges) for appropriateness and cost; and • Defining competitor responsibilities, especially for Challenges that take the form of "first-to-demonstrate competitions", where the competitors will determine the location and timing of Challenge events. It is anticipated that Challenge rules and details will include (but are not limited to): • Criteria for winning the Challenge, • Other competition rules, • Judging methodology (as needed), • Competition locations (as needed), • Competition dates (as needed),  • Purse size, and • Minimum entry criteria. Areas that should be addressed in your response to this RFI should include, but not be limited to the following:  • What are the best methods for gathering Challenge ideas? • What are the best methods for defining rules and other Challenge details? • What are the best methods for reviewing and refining Challenge rules so they are transparent, unbiased, and fair, and so that competitors cannot cheat the rules? • What are the best methods for identifying independent, technically competent reviewers for Challenge rules? • What are the best methods for identifying unbiased, technically competent judges for individual Challenges? • What are the best ways to identify likely overhead costs for individual Challenges during the formulation process, especially for Challenges that take the form of "repeatable contests"? • What steps can be taken during the formulation process to keep overhead costs low, especially for Challenges that take the form of "repeatable contests"? Competitor Recruitment The Competitor Recruitment function seeks to ensure a strong competitive field for Challenges by making potential competitors aware of these Challenges and encouraging their participation.  Under this function, NASA anticipates that Centennial Challenges support contractor(s) would be responsible for, or play a significant role in, developing and implementing an effective and efficient process for: • Identifying potential competitors for a specific Challenge; • Creating Challenge information and materials targeted at those potential competitors; • Identifying dissemination methods that target those potential competitors; • Disseminating information and materials to those potential competitors; • Discussing Challenges with potential competitors and answering their questions about Challenge rules and other details; and • Formally registering competitors for Challenges, including competitors' signatures on registration materials provided by NASA. Areas that should be addressed in your response to this RFI should include, but not be limited to the following:  • What are the best methods for identifying potential Challenge competitors? • What are the best methods for making potential competitors aware of a Challenge? • What are the best methods for encouraging potential competitors to enter and compete for a Challenge? Challenge Administration The Challenge Administration function involves responsibility for day-to-day administration of Challenge competitions.  Under this function, NASA anticipates that Centennial Challenges support contractor(s) would be responsible for tasks including (but not limited to): • Responding to inquiries from registered Challenge competitors; • Collecting competitor information at regular intervals, such as progress updates, dollars spent, team member lists, and photos; • Monitoring competitor adherence to Challenge rules; and • Maintain information services, such as websites and databases. Please address but do not limit your response to the following area: • How can day-to-day administration costs for individual Challenges be kept as low as possible? Challenge Information The Challenge Information function seeks to ensure that individual Challenges are well represented in the press and media and that public interest in and excitement regarding individual Challenges is strong.  Under this function, NASA anticipates that Centennial Challenges support contractor(s) would be responsible for, or play a significant role in: • Identifying desirable, likely, and/or other relevant press and media outlets for a specific Challenge; • Drafting press releases, other press materials, internet media, television media, and other media targeted at these outlets; • Creating dissemination plans, such as schedules for press and media events, over the life-cycle of a Challenge that target these outlets; • Executing this dissemination plan; • Discussing Challenges with press and answering their questions; and • Seeking and executing other methods for creating and maintaining public interest and excitement for individual Challenges. Areas that should be addressed in your response to this RFI should include, but not be limited to the following:  • What are the best methods for creating press and media interest in ongoing Challenges? • What are the best methods for ensuring strong press and media attendance at individual Challenge events? • Besides press and media outreach, are there other methods that can help create public excitement for individual Challenges? • What methods will work best for creating public interest in individual Challenges? • How can NASA maximize public interest and excitement while keeping costs for the publicity function as low as possible? Challenge Event Management All Centennial Challenges will culminate in an event where a single competitor (in the case of "first-to-demonstrate competitions") or multiple competitors (in the case of "repeatable contests") will make attempts to win the Challenge.  The Challenge Event Management function encompasses all the management functions needed to make these events successful.  Under this function, NASA anticipates that Centennial Challenges support contractor(s) would be responsible for, or play a significant role in: • Identifying and evaluating potential event locations (such as test sites or ranges) for "repeatable contests"; • Potentially negotiating and contracting with event locations for various event needs, such as security, press management, etc.; • Obtaining services for those events needs not provided by event locations; • Notifying competitors, judges, Centennial Challenges management, and other VIPs of Challenge events; and • Coordinating lodging/meals/travel/hospitality for judges and other VIPs. Areas that should be addressed in your response to this RFI should include, but not be limited to the following:  • For "repeatable contest events", what are the best methods for identifying, evaluating, contracting for, negotiating with, and otherwise obtaining event locations and their services, such as test sites or ranges? • What are the best methods for obtaining various event needs not provided by event locations, such as security, press management, lodging/meals/travel/hospitality for judges and VIPs, etc.?	Note that event needs will vary between "repeatable contests", where the event location and time has been provided for all competitors, and "first-to-demonstrate competitions", where competitors will determine event location and time. • How can costs for Challenge events, especially for "repeatable contests", be kept as low as possible? ATTACHMENT B: GENERAL QUESTIONS ON SUPPORT FOR FLAGSHIP AND KEYSTONE CHALLENGES Your organization should answer the following questions.  NASA may use this information in structuring future procurements for Flagship and Keystone Challenge support. • How should NASA organize support contracts for Centennial Challenges?  According to category of Challenge (Flagship and Keystone), by type of Challenge ("first-to-demonstrate competitions" or "repeatable contest events"), by support function, or by some other methodology?  Why? • Should one support contract cover both Flagship Challenges and Keystone Challenges or should NASA pursue two separate contracts?  Why? • Should one support contract cover both "first-to-demonstrate competitions" and "repeatable contest events" or should NASA pursue two separate contracts?  Why? • Should one support contract cover all support functions or should NASA pursue separate contracts for different support functions?  Why?  How should these support functions be grouped? • How can NASA promote teaming between support providers to meet its Flagship and Keystone Challenge needs? • How can NASA structure Centennial Challenges support contract to keep overhead costs low and thus maximize the amount of funding available for prize purses?

<SUBJECT>B--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - NASA CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES OUTREACH SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES
<DESC>External organizations are sought to support Quest Challenges, the outreach element of Centennial Challenges (www.centennialchallenges.nasa.gov) within the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (www.exploration.nasa.gov) of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.  These organizations will help with the planning, coordination, and execution of the following elements as they relate to individual Quest Challenges: • Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Outreach Plan Development • Challenge Formulation • Partner Organization Recruitment • Challenge Information • Challenge Administration • Challenge Event Management • Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Impact Assessment It is expected that this effort would consist of a competitively bid contract, augmented by partnerships with educational institutions and other organizations (relevant non-profits, primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, professional organizations, and other organizations).  This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to identify the field of possible supporting organizations based on the responses received and to obtain information that will help guide the development of future procurements.  Please respond to any or all of the RFI elements provided below. CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES OVERVIEW NASA Centennial Challenges was established to conduct prize competitions in support of the Vision for Space Exploration and ongoing NASA programs.  Centennial Challenges is modeled on past and ongoing prize competitions, including the 18th century British Longitude Prize; early 20th century aviation competitions, such as the Orteig Prize won by Charles Lindbergh; the ongoing Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge; and the recently won, privately funded, Ansari X PRIZE.  By making awards based on actual achievements instead of proposals, Centennial Challenges seeks novel and lower-cost solutions to engineering obstacles in civil space and aeronautics from new sources of innovation in industry, academia, and the public. There will be four categories of competitions conducted by Centennial Challenges, one of which is covered in this RFI - Quest Challenges.  The Alliance Challenge category is covered in a separate "Announcement of Partnership Opportunity".  The other two Challenge categories, Flagship and Keystone, are covered in a separate RFI. QUEST CHALLENGES Quest Challenges are intended to complement other Challenge categories by promoting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) awareness, subjects, and careers to youth and to other age groups who are not involved in STEM careers.  It is envisioned that Quest Challenges, categorized by and targeted at different age groups, will be inspirational and enriching.  Some Quest Challenges will involve individual or group activities, repeatable contests, or submission of entries for judging.	NASA hopes to offer cash prizes in the hundreds to thousands of dollars, or equivalent awards of interest to youth or other age groups. The support contractor for Quest Challenges will have a large role in the creation and design of specific Quest Challenges, but examples include: • Relevant student engineering Challenges, such as model rocket or robotic competitions; • Relevant student science competitions, such as the Intel Science Talent Search;  • Naming and/or logo design contests for individual Flagship, Keystone, or Alliance Challenges; • Science, Technology, Engineering and Math-related games and tournaments, such as internet-based games, card games, and video games; and • "Best Science/Science Fiction" Challenges in literature, art, and/or music. NASA anticipates that most Quest Challenges will be administered via no-cost partnerships between the Quest Challenge support contractor and youth and senior institutions and organizations (groups, clubs, non-profit organizations, primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, etc.) to ensure broad engagement and to maintain low overhead costs. However, a support subcontractor may conduct the administration of some highly visible Quest Challenges or internet-based Challenges. SUBMISSION DETAILS Given the background provided above, describe your organization's experiences, capabilities, and ideas for supporting Quest Challenges.  Where a more complete set of support functions can be provided, partnering between organizations is encouraged.  Joint submissions between two or more potential partnered organizations are welcome. Attachment A provides a description of the anticipated support functions for Quest Challenges. Attachment B provides a list of general questions that may be used to structure future procurements for Quest Challenge contract support. Your organization's submission may be used by the Government to determine the degree of interest in the industry and capabilities for planning purposes.  Submissions to this request shall be limited to no more than 15 pages, including attachments.  Submissions in response to this RFI should be made electronically in the body of or as an attachment to an email sent to Rhett.A.Herrera@nasa.gov.  All submissions must be received by December 17, 2004 at 5:00 p.m. EDT. Questions regarding this RFI should be directed to: Ken Davidian NASA Headquarters 300 E Street, SW Washington, DC	20546-0001 Tel.: (202) 358-0748 ATTACHMENT A: SUPPORT FUNCTIONS FOR QUEST CHALLENGES Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Outreach Plan Development Quest Challenges are the main inspirational and enriching outreach portion of NASA's Centennial Challenges program. It is very important that this category of Challenges make a measurable impact on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) awareness, subjects, and careers to youth and to other age groups who are not involved in STEM careers.   A clear STEM outreach plan will be critical to making measurable impacts.  Under the Outreach Plan Development function, NASA anticipates that Quest Challenges support contractor(s) would be responsible for, or play a significant role in: • Identification of desirable STEM impacts; • Identification of types of Quest Challenges that could support these STEM impacts; • Identification of metrics to measure these STEM impacts  • Formulation of an STEM Outreach Plan that includes desired STEM impacts, the Quest Challenges to support them, and associated metrics. Areas that should be addressed in your response to this RFI should include, but not be limited to the following: • What are some potential STEM impacts that Quest Challenges could be designed to address? • How should these STEM impacts be measured?  Are there low-cost ways of making such measurements? • What are examples of potential Quest Challenges that could be conducted to support these STEM impacts? Challenge Formulation The Quest Challenge Formulation function involves development and review of rules and other details of individual Quest Challenges. It is anticipated that support contractor(s) will play a significant role in guiding the formulation of individual challenges from initial concept to final rules release.

<SUBJECT>B--NASA CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES ANNOUNCEMENT OF PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY
<DESC>NASA seeks to identify potential partner organizations for various prize competitions to be conducted under Centennial Challenges (www.centennialchallenges.nasa.gov) within the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (www.exploration.nasa.gov) of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Partner organizations will have the opportunity to contribute cash or non-monetary resources towards one or more prize competitions (or Challenges) that support the Vision for Space Exploration and ongoing NASA programs.  In exchange, NASA expects that individual Challenges will demonstrate technologies or operational capabilities, and produce highly visible competition events of interest to the partnering organizations.  Partner organizations may provide inputs to the structure and rules of the Challenges to which they contribute. Partner organizations may include but are not limited to:  for-profit companies, universities and other non-profit or educational organizations, and professional or public organizations associated with space or aeronautics. Partner organizations cannot compete for the Challenges to which they contribute. All Challenges are still in the formulation stage, and no final decision has been made on whether or not to initiate the Challenges described in this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity.  Decisions to issue specific Challenges and their rules will be determined at later dates.  In some cases, these decisions are pending Congressional authorization for NASA to conduct large prize competitions. CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES BACKGROUND NASA Centennial Challenges was established to conduct prize competitions in support of the Vision for Space Exploration and ongoing NASA programs.  Centennial Challenges is modeled on past and ongoing prize competitions, including the 18th century British Longitude Prize; early 20th century aviation competitions, such as the Orteig Prize won by Charles Lindbergh; the ongoing Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge; and the recently won, privately funded, Ansari X PRIZE.  By making awards based on actual achievements instead of proposals, Centennial Challenges seeks novel and lower-cost solutions to engineering obstacles in civil space and aeronautics from new sources of innovation in industry, academia, and the public. TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS NASA anticipates two types of Challenge partners:  Co-Sponsor Organizations and Allied Organizations. Co-Sponsor Organizations Co-Sponsor Organizations are those Challenge partners that contribute cash towards the prize purse for one or more Challenges.  In return for their cash contribution, the Co-Sponsor Organization would be associated with the specific Challenge, and/or the rules of the competition may require the winning contestant to grant certain rights to intellectual property or capabilities produced in the course of the competition to the Co-Sponsor Organization and /or the Government.  The specific details of Co-Sponsor arrangements will be determined through the Partner Selection Process and the specific agreement to be negotiated with the selected partner described below.  Co-Sponsor Organizations cannot compete in the Challenges to which they contribute.   Allied Organizations Allied Organizations are those Challenge partners that provide in-kind services, in addition to those that NASA will provide, to enhance the competition.  The specific details of these arrangements will be determined through the Partner Selection Process and the specific agreement to be negotiated with the selected partner described below.  Allied Organizations cannot compete in the Challenges for which they are partners.   TYPES OF CHALLENGES NASA plans four categories of prize competitions under Centennial Challenges.  This Announcement of Partnership Opportunity seeks to identify prospective partners for Flagship Challenges, Keystone Challenges, and Alliance Challenges, each of which is described in greater detail below.  The fourth category of prize competitions, Quest Challenges, is intended to complement other Challenge categories by promoting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) awareness, subjects, and careers to youth and to other age groups who are not involved in STEM careers.	The category of Quest Challenges is not covered in this announcement. Individual Challenges will take one of two forms:  1) "first-to-demonstrate competitions", like the Longitude Prize, Orteig Prize, and Ansari X PRIZE; and 2) "repeatable contests", like the DARPA Grand Challenge.	It is important to differentiate between these types of Challenges because each will make different demands on Challenge partners. Flagship Challenges Flagship Challenges are intended to encourage external teams to independently design, develop, launch, and operate space missions and thereby generate innovative and/or low-cost approaches to various civil space goals that would not otherwise be pursued.   It is envisioned that all Flagship Challenges will be "first-to-demonstrate" competitions and will offer cash purses ranging from millions to tens of millions of dollars to the winners of individual competitions.  NASA intends to pursue this type of challenge once Congress has provided the necessary authority.	 Flagship Challenges will be open to competitors from private sector companies, non-profit research institutions, university researchers, student teams, hobbyists, and any combination thereof.  Examples of Flagship-type prize competitions include the Orteig Prize and the X PRIZE.	Candidate Flagship Challenges for which NASA is seeking Co-Sponsor Organizations include, but are not limited to, prize competitions for: • A soft robotic lunar landing,  • A micro reentry vehicle,  • An aero-assist demonstration, and • A station-keeping solar sail. NASA's Centennial challenges program has established a link on the NASA Exploration Systems website (exploration.nasa.gov/centennialchallenge/cc_submit.html) for submission of challenge ideas; ideas for future challenges may be submitted by sending an email to ccideas@hq.nasa.gov. Keystone Challenges Keystone Challenges are intended to encourage the development and demonstration of advanced technologies and/or innovative capabilities that support NASA's mission areas, and, where possible, have strong synergy with other applications.  Keystone Challenges may be component-, subsystem-, or system-level demonstrations, and may involve robotic contests, drop tests, and/or atmospheric flight tests.	 Depending on the technical goal, Keystone Challenges may take the form of "first-to-demonstrate competitions" or "repeatable contests", and will offer cash purses ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to the winners of individual Challenges.  NASA intends to pursue those Keystone Challenges with large prize purses once Congress has provided the necessary authority. Keystone Challenges will also be open to private sector companies, non-profit research institutions, university researchers, student teams, hobbyists, and any combination thereof.  The Longitude Prize and the DARPA Grand Challenge are two examples of Keystone-type prize competitions.  Candidate Keystone Challenges for which NASA is seeking Co-Sponsor Organizations include, but are not limited to: "First-to-demonstrate competitions" for: • Lightweight radiation shielding, • A mobile power storage breakthrough, • Improved and new physical and chemical lunar resource processing techniques, • An advanced astronaut glove, • An autonomous drill, • An autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for cargo, • A long-duration, station-keeping UAV, and • A hybrid airship. "Repeatable contests" for: • Advances in materials, especially nanotube tethers; • Advances in lightweight power transmission, especially beamed power; • Advances in deployable telescope technology, especially those that could be applicable to space-based observatories; • Advances in general aviation technologies, especially those applicable to other modes of air transport; • A precision landing system; • An advanced tele-robotic construction system; • Highly mobile and cooperative autonomous robots; and • A human lunar all-terrain vehicle. As noted above, NASA's Centennial challenges program has established a link on the NASA Exploration Systems website (exploration.nasa.gov/centennialchallenge/cc_submit.html) for submission of challenge ideas; ideas for future challenges may be submitted by sending an email to ccideas@hq.nasa.gov. Alliance Challenges An Alliance Challenge is identical to a Keystone Challenge, except that the prize is administered by an Allied Organization (see above), at no or little cost to NASA, in exchange for the opportunity to be associated with the prize competition.  Alliance Challenges are designed to leverage the capabilities of various non-profit organizations with domain expertise and/or members in the organization to administer a Challenge competition at no cost to NASA.  Candidate Alliance Challenges for which NASA is seeking partners include any and all of the Keystone Challenges described above. PARTNERSHIP SELECTION PROCESS NASA will select Challenge Partners based on the following evaluation criteria: • Ability of the prospective partner organization to substantially contribute to one or more Challenges; • Ability of the prospective partner organization to recuse itself from competition in the Challenge(s) in which it wishes to partner; and • Potential for the prospective partner organization's mission, vision, and values to complement NASA's vision, mission, and values; and • Prospective partner's experience and demonstrated ability to conduct highly visible competitive events. Using the specific evaluation criteria, NASA will select the Challenge Partner(s) for Co-Sponsor Organizations and Allied Organizations who best demonstrate the ability to further NASA's Vision for Space Exploration. NASA and a prospective Challenge partner may ultimately negotiate a Space Act Agreement (SAA) to define the terms of the cooperation.	The SAA will detail the contributions and responsibilities of NASA and the partner organization for a specific Challenge.  The agreement will also address other important aspects of the Challenge, such as Challenge rules, media rights and intellectual property rights. For those challenges where Congressional authority will be required, NASA and a prospective challenge partner may enter into a preliminary Space Act agreement to initiate cooperation and negotiate in good faith towards a comprehensive Space Act agreement to be executed once existing restrictions, such as the requirement for Congressional authority, are removed. SUBMISSION DETAILS Responses to this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity should be no more than five pages in length and: Briefly describe your organization; • Identify the Challenge(s) in which your organization wishes to partner with NASA (see lists above); • Identify the type of partnership your organization is seeking, either a Co-Sponsor partnership or an Alliance partnership (see descriptions above); • Describe your organization's reason(s) for wanting to partner on this Challenge(s); • In the case of prospective Co-Sponsor partnerships, include an estimate of the amount of cash funding your organization would be interested in contributing to the prize purse(s) for this Challenge(s); and • In the case of prospective Alliance partnerships, describe the prize competition administration capabilities that your organization could bring to bear on this Challenge(s). Duration This Announcement of Partnership Opportunity will remain continuously open to provide future opportunities to expand the number of Challenge partnerships.  NASA plans to update this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity at regular intervals to reflect changes in Centennial Challenges planning. NASA will begin evaluating submissions to this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity starting four weeks from this posting date.  Depending on the number of submissions received for specific Challenges, NASA may close some Challenges to submissions starting on that date.  Submissions received after that date for a Challenge that has been closed will be returned to the sender without review. Contact Information Submissions in response to this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity should be made electronically in the body of or as an attachment to an email sent to Rhett.A.Herrera@nasa.gov.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests.

<DESC>WORK STATEMENT

“Definitional Mission” for Advisory and Assistance Services by Non-Governmental Sources for Nigeria.”

Project Title:  Nigeria: Oil and Gas Definitional Mission

1		Scope of Work

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility studies or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative studies or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues, as called for in Section C.

2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassies in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of each Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to various locations within Nigeria to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy personnel.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.
  
3		Definitional Mission Final Report

3.1		Executive Summary (1-2 Pages)

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

Refinery Operations:

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made attempts in recent years to improve petroleum practices in the country.  Nigeria imports most of its refined product and the NNPC has established incentives in order to encourage foreign direct investment and domestic investment for the establishment of new refinery operations in the country.  NNPC is also faced with a decision to either upgrade existing state-owned refineries still in operation or to privatize these refineries.  USTDA has been approached repeatedly to consider involvement with new refinery operations in Nigeria, however the agency has yet to find an optimal situation to justify feasibility study level involvement.  Considering all of these factors, the DM consultant will analyze potential opportunities for USTDA assistance in refinery operations in Nigeria.  Specifically, the DM consultant will investigate the potential for USTDA funding assistance with the possible privatization of Nigeria’s existing refineries.

Natural Gas:

The Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) has been established as a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.  This was done in an attempt to diversify the economy from solely based on petroleum to also include natural gas, and also to appease the international community insisting Nigeria move to diminish the practice of flaring excess gas associated with petroleum production.  The mission of the NGC includes: ending flaring and developing a domestic natural gas market, capturing economic value and generating revenue, and creating new industry.  Although some developments have occurred to date, NGC is still struggling to meet expectations.  The Downstream Gas Act has been prepared for the GON and The World Bank Group, and is currently under review by both entities.  This Act’s enactment will greatly increase the attractiveness for investment in natural gas activities in the country as it addresses past hindrances identified by private sector parties.

USTDA committed funding for a Gas Utilization feasibility study in 2001 (USTDA#2000-10030B).  The grantee was the NNPC and Pace Energy Consulting was the U.S. firm selected to conduct the study.  As part of this definitional mission, the DM consultant will be required to review this past feasibility study and to follow-up on recommendations made in the study.  This review may result in identification of U.S. exports and/or project developments previously not accounted for as a result of the study.  

Downstream natural gas projects have been identified as primary areas open for investment in the Nigerian gas sector.  The DM consultant will be expected to identify opportunities for U.S. exports and investment in on-going or new project developments in the Nigerian gas sector.  Specifically, the DM consultant will conduct a preliminary evaluation of a private proposal to USTDA from the for a methanol production plant.  

Pipeline Network:

NNPC retains ownership of the fuel pipeline infrastructure network in Nigeria.  Constant low-tech “bunkering” of the pipeline network throughout the country severely impacts operations.  Bunkering occurs when a pipeline is tapped and the product is siphoned off illegally.  Such actions often result in both loss of life and environmental harm, as explosions are frequent.  One such recent explosion in a village near Lagos resulted in 50 people killed and many more wounded as a result of the explosion, and a fire that ensued for five days.  In this instance, the pipeline spilled fuel into a river, which further spread the fire as the fuel on the water ignited.  Sporadic bunkering and similar incidents such as this example are expected to continue.  The human and environmental toll from such incidents is magnified because the GON does not have the capacity to contain such events in a timely manner.  

Although the entire pipeline is not under-question, many links are often in a state of disrepair due to years of poor maintenance that these sections constantly leach petroleum products into surrounding soil and/or water.  These sections also offer tempting targets for those looking to siphon product.  

The DM consultant will be expected to investigate how USTDA assistance to NNPC may be used appropriately in order to address pipeline maintenance and GON ability to respond to pipeline explosions.  This analysis could result in recommendations for an orientation visit and/or capacity building and training activity.  


The DM consultant will be expected to conduct initial research on oil and gas sector project developments and opportunities in Nigeria before travel to identify those most suited for USTDA involvement.  The DM consultant will be required to travel to Nigeria to further investigate opportunities, meet with appropriate public and private sector representatives, and conduct site visits.  In Nigeria, the DM consultant will at minimum travel to the following cities: Lagos, Abuja, and Warri.  (Port Harcourt may also be considered, however it will depend upon U.S. Embassy Abuja advice as to the stability of the city at the time of proposed travel.)  

In Lagos, the DM consultant will meet with appropriate U.S. Consulate personnel and representatives from private sector companies involved with Nigeria’s oil and gas sector.  Travel to Abuja will include meeting with appropriate U.S. Embassy personnel and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.  In Warri, the DM consultant will meet with the Nigerian Gas Company and likely conduct a site-visit of the Warri petroleum refinery.  The DM consultant will also be expected to arrange for a site visit of an existing pipeline network considered under-maintained somewhere in the country.  The location of this site-visit will be determined by NNPC and U.S. Embassy staff.  If included, a visit to Port Harcourt would include meetings with private sector companies in Nigeria’s oil and gas sector, NNPC and/or NGC personnel, and potentially a site visit.
