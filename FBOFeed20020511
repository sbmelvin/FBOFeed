<DESC>NAICS Code 5413. Architectural/Engineering and Related Services
Revised Notice pertaining to A&E Project No. SSA-0802-02-5030.  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES to provide architectural/engineering (A/E) design, administration, management and investigation services for the Social Security Administration (SSA).  THIS REQUIREMENT IS SET-ASIDE ONLY FOR A&E FIRMS CERTIFIED UNDER THE U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 8(a) PROGRAM.

SSA seeks an A/E firm to provide professional services for overall design, project administration, facilities management and multi-discipline (architectural, electrical, mechanical, structural and specialized engineering) support for SSA's nationwide facilities program.  Services are to be order by issuance of task orders under an indefinite quantity contract.

Designated professional services will include but may not be limited to: pre-design, site analysis, schematic design, design development, construction documents, bidding and negotiation, construction contract administration, post-construction and certain non-sequential services such as: special studies, life cycle cost analysis, value analysis, quantity surveys, detailed construction cost estimates, energy studies, environmental monitoring, graphics design, special furnishings design, computer applications, materials and systems testing, photography and videotaping.  Proficiency in the state-of-the art computer software, e-mail, AutoCAD or Microstation is required.

Facilities work will include but not be limited to small office buildings to large sophisticated special use buildings and computer rooms for the latest state-of-the-art computer and people environment.

Consideration will be limited to primary/prime firms with the required disciplines having an existing established office within the Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. geographic area of the SSA Headquarters located in Baltimore, Maryland. The need for close coordination between SSA and the A/E Contractor is essential to the success of the delivery tasks. Telephone coordination alone would be insufficient to ensure the high quality work products.

The selection will be based on the below listed weighted evaluation categories.  More weight will be given in each of the evaluation categories to the prime firm as opposed to the prime?s proposed consultant(s)/subcontractor(s).

1. PROJECT TEAM (25 PERCENT)
This category will be used to evaluate the A-E's proposed key personnel with respect to their qualifications, individual experience, and past experience as team members on similar projects.
A. Evaluate the A/E's proposed team in terms of each member's professional background experience in construction and repair and improvement projects.
1. Evaluate key personnel's educational background and professional registration.
2. Evaluate key personnel's past experience in their technical field.
B. Evaluate the A-E's proposed team in terms of team makeup and interrelationship of technical, management, and production disciplines to meet the program needs.
1. Evaluate key personnel's past experience working as members of a team, more specifically past experience as a member of this proposed team.
2. Evaluate the A/E's rationale for the selection of each member who makes up the team.

2. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT (25 PERCENT)
This category will be used to evaluate the A/E's proposed plan for execution of a task order?s required design/project inspection and production of reports on the basis of team organization, and management and control procedures to accomplish this project.
A. Evaluate the A/E's overall organization in terms of its potential for efficient operation on, and responsiveness to, the needs of task orders.
1. Evaluate the firm's overall organization with a view toward its adaptability for inspection and technical reporting as opposed to only building design.
2. Determine the degree to which the current staffing of the firm and proposed consultant firms will be capable of undertaking task orders, in terms of required expertise, facilities size, and available manpower.
3. Evaluate the ongoing workloads of the firm and its consultants to determine their capability of undertaking task orders and the priority it will likely receive in relation to their other work.
4. Evaluate the proposed level of direct involvement in task orders by the prime firm(s) in comparison with the level considered appropriate to maintain control of this project.
5. Evaluate the firm's proposed method of administration of task orders to ensure satisfactory and timely completion of all requirements.
6. Evaluate the direct involvement in task orders of personnel who make up the ownership level of the firm(s) in comparison with that which would be appropriate.
B. Evaluate the A/E's proposed project team organization and procedures for planning the execution and control of task orders.
1. Evaluate the A/E's proposed means of gathering necessary background information on task orders, assimilation and analysis of this information, and translation of this information through a structured planning process into a program for incremental accomplishment of required new construction and/or alteration/repair and improvement work.
2. Evaluate the proposed method for controlling each task order?s schedule limitations.
3. Evaluate the proposed method for controlling each task order?s scope and budget.

3. TECHNICAL ABILITY (25 PERCENT)
This category will be used to evaluate the A/E's capacity and potential for product excellence, including innovation, recognition of alternative solutions, and perception of special opportunities.
A. Evaluate the A/E's demonstrated awareness of design problems in new construction and alteration/repair and improvement work.
B. Evaluate the A/E's demonstrated understanding of fire and life safety standards, elimination of architectural barriers, code limitations, and OSHA requirements.
C. Evaluate methodology for attaining maximum conservation of energy, materials, etc., while maintaining maximum results within restrictive budgets.
D. Evaluate the A/E's demonstrated capacity for excellence on the basis of major honors, awards, and recognition received.

4. RELATED EXPERIENCE (20 PERCENT)
This category will be used to evaluate the A/E's successful accomplishment of projects similar in nature.
A. Evaluate the A/E's capability to successfully accomplish planning, design, inspection, and production of technical reports as demonstrated by relevant examples of previous work similar in nature and magnitude (either as a firm or through individual experience by proposed project team members).
B. Based on project examples presented by the A/E firm(s), evaluate past performance in the following areas:
1. Conformance to program requirement and scope of services
2. Adherence to budgets
3. Delivery of submittals within schedules
4. Preparation of complete, clear, and comprehensive reports requiring minimum review changes

5. SUPPLEMENTAL POINTS (5 PERCENT MAXIMUM) 
Supplemental points will be given for good performance on previous Federal, state and/or county Government contract experience.

Consideration will be limited to primary firms having an existing active Architect/Engineer office within the area defined.  The A/E must be capable of performing simultaneously multiple projects at multiple locations. This indefinite quantity contract will cover a one-year period with a unilateral option by the Government for four one-year renewals. The maximum amounts to be expended shall not exceed $1,000,000.00 (minimum $200,000) for the base year and for each option year, if exercised. Work under the contract will be by Delivery Order. Each delivery order will be negotiated individually. The architect-engineer firm shall respond to assignments issued by the Contracting Officer. Firms or and/or joint ventures meeting the designated geographical limitations and having the capabilities to perform the services described herein are invited to respond by submitting two copies each of completed Standard Forms 254 and 255 along with a letter of interest referencing A&E Project No. SSA-0802-02-5030 to be received by the office listed above on or before May 31, 2002.  Standard Form 254 should also be included for all consultants proposed as team members. All forms 254 are considered current if they are not more than one (1) year old from the month of this announcement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The Government will not recognize costs associated with the preparation and submittal of Standard Forms 254 and 255.
