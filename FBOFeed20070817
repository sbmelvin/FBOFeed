<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for approximately 3 different types of batteries with varying quantities as indicated on Attachment 1 that will support annual replacement of existing C & D batteries utilized in General National Airspace System (GNAS) and terminal facility systems.  Typical quantities of flooded cell batteries will be 18 per location.  The contractor shall provide batteries with manufacturer date codes no more than 1 month prior to the installation date and shipped to specific locations and by specific delivery dates identified by the FAA.  The contractor shall also provide a lift gate and pallet jack to offload batteries at each designated site and shall remain onsite during battery replacement, and shall palletize old batteries and load onto truck for removal.  The contractor shall provide recycling certificates for all old batteries that shall be picked up from designated delivery locations. The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 335911. The proposed contract is for a base year with option provisions to renew for four additional one-year periods.  These batteries are only known to be available from C & D Technologies, Standby Power Division, (C & D), 1400 Union Meeting Road, Blue Bell, PA 19422, the original manufacturer, because they own the proprietary data rights for the manufacturing and engineering specifications.  The FAA does not have available complete technical documentation to allow other sources to supply and support the GNAS. This requirement is being processed using limitation of sources to a single source as provided for under the FAA AMS Section 3.2.2.4.  This procurement is considered to be single source based upon standardization.  If existing C &D batteries are replaced with a different brand of battery, each battery scheduled for replacement will impose additional hidden costs for engineering studies and documentation that are not factored into the purchase price of the different battery.  If existing batteries are replaced with a different brand of battery, additional time will be required to accomplish the necessary engineering and coordination prior to deploying replacement batteries.    The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these products.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA. This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing. The maximum line of credit is $750,000.

<SUBJECT>F -- Threat Assessment and Pilot Surveillance Plan for the Papahanaumokuakea National Marine Monument
<SOLNBR>AB133C07RP0105A
<RESPDATE>071807
<CONTACT>Stephanie Garnett, Contract Specialist, Phone (808)944-2228, Fax (808)944-2141, Email stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA?s Papahanaumokuakea National Marine Monument Office requires a contractor to provide all supervision, material and labor necessary to perform a comprehensive threat assessment and pilot surveillance project of the newly formed Monument area in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI).  Due to the size of the NWHI region, its remote location, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of management in the area, a threat assessment geared at the protection of the resources from the deep ocean to the land has not been conducted.  Characterizing and evaluating threats to the area coming from human activities such as illegal access, poaching, and unforeseen concerns arising from innovations in maritime technology will be an important part of this assessment.  Threats to the NWHI have been previously researched through the identification of a number of relevant data sets and an enforcement workshop geared at identifying solutions to remote enforcement issues in the area.  However, these have not been comprehensively evaluated or prioritized.  Therefore, the first task of this contract is to conduct a thorough threat assessment working with the co-trustee management agencies (NOAA, USFWS, and the State of Hawaii), the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Defense, and relevant non-governmental entities.  This assessment will utilize to the extent necessary, public, commercial, classified and de-classified data to identify threats.  These threats should be prioritized by potential impact and probability of occurring, as well as geographically referenced.  The second task includes a review of the threat assessment with the management and enforcement agencies and an evaluation of existing assets for surveillance.  AIS, RadarSat imagery and sonar buoy arrays have been used by various agencies in the past, and potentially could be woven together for Monument management purposes in the future.  Identifying and evaluating these assets are important steps in creating an effective surveillance plan for the Monument.  Potential contractors shall have DOD security clearance that would allow them to evaluate the utility of military assets and data sets for surveillance purposes.  Many surveillance tools have been proposed for the Monument, including satellite surveillance, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), radar, AIS, SONAR arrays, etc.  However, they have not been evaluated against a comprehensive threat assessment, and compared by cost to benefit, and feasibility. This analysis will be used to develop a prioritized list of short, medium and long-term surveillance solutions for the Monument.  A small-scale pilot demonstration project will be selected from the prioritized list of solutions discussed above.  This project should demonstrate the capacity to conduct remote surveillance in the Monument, and should not be dependant upon the construction of significant infrastructure.

Scope of Work
1.	Convene and meet with a Monument core surveillance committee (MCSC) to identify relevant partners and establish key contacts
a.	Convene a Monument Core Surveillance Committee;
b.	Identify organizations at the federal, state, and local levels with significant stakeholder interests in ? and responsibilities for ? the study, management, and protection of the Monument and establish cooperative agreements where appropriate;
c.	Develop an understanding of the Monument management structure, existing enforcement and surveillance capacity, and regulations; and
d.	Develop a review process for documents and procedure for consultation.
2.	Conduct a Threat Assessment
a.	Evaluate and integrate all existing surveillance reports, workshop summaries, and previously identified data sets (private, public, classified, declassified and unclassified);
b.	Determine and define historical, present and future threats to the Monument;
c.	Assess the known threats to Monument resources using existing data sets;
d.	Evaluate existing surveillance capacity ? overflights, eyes on the water, human presence, VMS, listening stations, etc.;
e.	Prioritize threats geospatially, and if feasible divide the Monument into surveillance zones;
f.	Review threat assessment with MCSC; and 
g.	Write Threat Assessment Report (TAR).
3.	Surveillance Plans
a.	Evaluate the availability and utility of existing data for surveillance from public, commercial, government classified, unclassified and declassified data sets, existing sensors, acoustics, and remote sensing capacity;
b.	Evaluate existing technologies for surveillance (signal intelligence, acoustic, UAV, AUV, satellite imagery, terrestrial and marine based sensors, etc);
c.	Evaluate information required in order to carry out prosecution of illegal activities (i.e. is satellite data admissible in a court of law, or are hi-res images needed for prosecution?);
d.	Using TAR, develop prioritized short, medium, and long term surveillance strategies with cost/benefit and feasibility analysis;
1.	Each strategy, such as using AUV?s, or acoustic arrays should have a visual depiction of cost/benefit and feasibility and identification of point of diminishing returns
e.	Write short, medium and long-term surveillance plans (these plans should be written in such a way to accommodate a Spiral Development Process).
4.	Conduct Pilot Surveillance Project
a.	With MCSC develop a demonstration surveillance project

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. AG-518P-S-07-AA75 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.
USDA/ARS, Photosynthesis Research Unit, Urbana, IL has a requirement for a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Instrument to measure real-time binding of protein with small ligands or other proteins.  Research Projects currently being conducted will have immediate application for this instrument.  On project involves 14-3-3 proteins which are phosphoserine-binding proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.  Immobilized 14-3-3s will be used to identify binding partners (so-called client proteins) and to determine the strength of interactions (disassociation constants).  Research could also identify small molecules that might bind to 14-3-3s, and SPR is an ideal approach for this.  Other research being conducted involves identifying receptor kinases, and SPR is one approach to identify interacting pairs.  In addition research will be conducted using this instrument for many other applications within the unit, for example, to study Rubisco interaction with Rubisco-activase, etc.  These applications require a sophisticated instrument meeting or exceeding the following salient characteristics:  1)  Must have two measurement channels, to correct nonspecific binding.  2)  Must accommodate variable sample volumes (e.g., 1 2 to 2000 millicuries) to conserve samples.  3)  Must have high measurement sensitivity to allow detection of low molecular weight analytes (e.g., 200 Daltons).  4)  Instrument must be stable, with low baseline noise and low baseline drift    5)  Must have chips that allow for different chemistries to be used to immobilize the ligand.  The two most important are nickel-NTA chip to bind His6-fusion proteins, and a streptavidin-modified surface to capture biotin-containing molecules.  6)  Temperature must be adjustable; for example from 10 degrees to 60 degrees celsius.  7)  Must come with software to analyze binding parameters.  8)  Must come with on-site and off-site training.  8)  Please specify warranty provided with instrument .  9)  Please specify any available instrument service plans along with estimated cost and duration of those proposed  DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE: Offerors shall submit 2 copies of the descriptive literature describing their proposed equipment in enough detail to ascertain whether the equipment meets the criteria listed above.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) is developing a Transportation, Aging and Disposal (TAD) canister-based system to simplify and standardize operations throughout the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System.  The TAD canister will be the key interface component that facilitates the various TAD system functions envisioned for temporary storage of commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) at utility sites, (as necessary), transport to the repository, aging at the repository and ultimate disposal when placed into a waste package.  As such, components of a TAD canister-based system will comply with applicable regulatory requirements of 10 CFR Part 71, 10 CFR Part 72 and 10 CFR Part 63. As part of the design and certification process, each vendor will prepare and submit safety analysis reports (SARs) to NRC for docketing and evaluation. These SARs shall be of sufficient detail such that the vendor can obtain 10 CFR Part 71 and 10 CFR Part 72 certificates of compliance (CoC). The development and demonstration strategy for the TAD canister-based system requires the vendor to work with one or more nuclear utility entity(ies). The vendor and its utility entity must demonstrate the operation of the TAD canister-based system after the vendor obtains the 10 CFR Part 72 CoC at the utility site.  Performance specifications needed to integrate the TAD canister-based system with the system components will be specified by the user utility.  All components, hardware and software needed to operate the TAD canister-based system at a commercial nuclear independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) facility will be provided by others. To facilitate DOE preparation of a 10 CFR Part 63 license application (LA), the vendor shall prepare a design report, analogous to the 10 CFR Part 72 SAR, for the aging configuration at the repository.

<SOLNBR>DTFAAC-07-R-06050
<RESPDATE>083107
<ARCHDATE>09302007
<CONTACT>Brandon Iven, (405) 954-7667
<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for approximately 6 different types of batteries with varying quantities as indicated on Attachment 1 that will support annual replacement of existing C & D batteries utilized in General National Airspace System (GNAS) and terminal facility systems.  Typical quantities of VRLA batteries will be 30-40 per string and location.  Some locations will have multiple strings, which will increase the number of typical quantities.  The contractor shall provide batteries with manufacturer date codes no more than 1 month prior to the installation date and shipped to specific locations and by specific delivery dates identified by the FAA.  The contractor shall also provide a lift gate and pallet jack to offload batteries at each designated site and shall pick up old palletized batteries from delivery locations when directed by FAA and no later than 1-2 weeks after scheduled installation and send the old palletized batteries to smelter.  The contractor shall provide recycling certificates for all old batteries that shall be picked up from designated delivery locations. The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 335911. The proposed contract is for a base year with option provisions to renew for four additional one-year periods.  These batteries are only known to be available from C & D Technologies, Dynasty Division, 90 East Keefe Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53212, the original manufacturer, because they own the proprietary data rights for the manufacturing and engineering specifications.  The FAA does not have available complete technical documentation to allow other sources to supply and support the GNAS. This requirement is being processed using limitation of sources to a single source as provided for under the FAA AMS Section 3.2.2.4.  This procurement is considered to be single source based upon standardization.  If existing C &D batteries are replaced with a different brand of battery, each battery scheduled for replacement will impose additional hidden costs for engineering studies and documentation that are not factored into the purchase price of the different battery.  If existing batteries are replaced with a different brand of battery, additional time will be required to accomplish the necessary engineering and coordination prior to deploying replacement batteries.    The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these products.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA. This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing. The maximum line of credit is $750,000. For further information and applicable forms concerning the STLP, call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169." Any questions must be sent via email to brandon.iven@faa.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to update the previously released announcement regarding The Navstar Global Positioning Wing (GPSW), Space and Missile Systems Center's (SMC) planned activities for the progressive competition and down-selection for the acquisition and production (Phases B/C and D) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized Space Receiver (MSR).  GPS MSR is a phased acquisition; Phase A included trade studies, refinement of the Technical Requirements Documents and the Protection Profile.  Phase A period of performance was from 28 September 2006 through completion of the System Design Review.  The requirements of Phase B/C include the development and delivery of Developmental Flight Units (DFUs) that are flight worthy and Engineering Developmental Units (EDUs) for early testing in the laboratory.  Specific quantities required for each type of hardware shall be specified in the upcoming Call for Improvements (CFI) RFP to be released in September 2007.  The period of performance for Phase B/C is 36 months after contract award.  Phase D includes annual production options with the Government's minimum requirements of two MSR units each year.  The period of performance for Phase D is 2010 through 2020.  Throughout Phases B/C and D, the Government may also procure Developmental Flight Units (DFU) Support, Production Flight Unit (PFU) Support, as well as Special Studies and Classified Special Studies as necessary for the MSR Program. 
RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 resulted in contract awards to General Dynamics C4 Systems, Inc. and ITT Industries Space Systems, LLC for Phase A activities.  The CFI RFP will include complete proposal preparation instructions and proposal evaluation criteria.  To be competitive, potential offerors for Phases B/C and D that were not Phase A incumbents must be able to clearly demonstrate their capability to perform Phases B/C and D work and proposed system maturity necessary to successfully perform the said  Phases.  To meet the requirements of the CFI RFP, potential offerors who are not currently performing Phase A contracts will be required to include in their proposals the same contractual documents required by RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 and RFP Amendments 0001-0006.  Specific information and instructions with respect to these documents is contained in RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 and its Amendments thereto.   These and other GPS program documents are available to all potential offerors in the MSR Bidder's Library.   To gain access to the MSR Bidder's Library contact Capt Joel Rivera at (310) 653-3535 or by e-mail at joel.rivera@losangeles.af.mil.  In addition to establishing a Bidder's Library account, potential offerors desiring to access MSR documentation from the Bidder's Library must have the following Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components: (a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or (b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html).  Any questions in regards to obtaining a CAC or ECA, should be directed Mr. John Pezan at (310) 653-3208 or by email at john.pezan@losangeles.af.mil.  The approximate timeframe for processing a CAC or ECA is eight (8) weeks.  The process time for access to the MSR Bidder's Library website is approximately one (1) week for offerors currently possessing a CAC or ECA.  
In order to demonstrate an offeror's technical capability and system maturity, competitors (including those not currently performing on MSR Phase A contracts) will be required to perform a System Design Review (SDR) demonstration as was identified in RFP FA8807-05-R-0001, Part IV, Attachment 1 to Section L, "MSR Program Statement of Objectives", subparagraph "MSR Contract Objectives Phase A", and RFP Amendment 0005.  Amendment 0005 provides a description of the System Design Review for the MSR program.  As called out in Amendment 0005, the MSR demonstration (SDR) will be a review to ensure that the offeror's proposed MSR can proceed into preliminary design and that all system requirements and functional performance requirements reflected in the Technical Requirements Document (TRD)/Protection Profile (PP), as updated through the results of the trade analysis conducted during Phase A by the Requirements Technical Interchange Working Group (RTIWG), are defined.  Further, the demonstration will ensure that those system and functional performance requirements are consistent with program budget, schedule, risk and other system constraints.  The demonstration will determine whether the MSR functional definition is decomposed to a level sufficient to begin preliminary design.  Completion of the demonstration shall provide:
1. An established system functional baseline;
2. A MSR risk assessment;
3. A System/Subsystem Description Document (SSDD), and; 
4. A program development schedule including hardware and software critical path drivers.
5. Results of Phase A CAIV (Cost as an Independent Variable) trade studies
A successful demonstration (SDR) shall be predicated upon the Government's determination that the MSR performance requirements and plans for design and development form a satisfactory basis for proceeding into preliminary design.
The Government will work with offerors not participating in Phase A to schedule the SDR during the discussion phase of source selection.  
As stated in Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award (page 1), RFP FA8807-05-R-0001, and Section H - Special Contract Requirements (SCR), SMC - H014 of the resulting contracts, the criteria for the Government's selection of the best overall offer will include best value assessment of the CFI proposal, innovation and cost justification demonstrated in Trade Studies, successful completion of design review with a robust, compliant, and low risk design for development and production, successful compliance with all contract requirements, responses to the Engineering Process Questionnaire (EPQ), responsive and effective management, and technical competence.  The Government reserves the right to change these evaluation criteria at any time.  Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the Government's CFI RFP.  
Information associated with the MSR Program may be classified up to SECRET.  Offerors and their teammates interested in competing will be required to have a minimum of SECRET facility clearance and personnel cleared to the SECRET level prior to award of the resultant contract.  Only offers submitted by U.S.-owned companies performing within the continental United States or its territories will be considered for award.   
This pre-solicitation notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered a request to submit proposal or otherwise be considered as a commitment by the Government.  To aid in planning and scheduling events with respect to the competition, request offerors (other than those currently performing Phase A contracts) interested in competing, provide the Government with a Statement of Interest and Capability (SIC).  The SIC should describe the prospective offeror's team, each team member role in the MSR program, capabilities of each member of the team, experience of each team member in performing efforts each team member will be proposed to provide.  At a minimum, the SIC should cover (1) military GPS receiver development, (2) space-qualified GPS receiver development, and (3) GPS M-code.  SICs shall be no more than ten pages and shall be submitted to GPSW/GPK (ATTN: Ms. Debbie D. Tatum, 483 N. Aviation Boulevard, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 or via email to debbie.tatum@losangeles.af.mil).  Responses to this notice must be received not later than 45 calendar days after publication in FedBizOps.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fogarty International Center (FIC) intends to procure services to analyze data to explore spatial and temporal relationships between respiratory infections across the U.S. and determine relative burden of respiratory pathogens, in particular influenza and RSV from Corinne M. Ringholz, Rochester, N.Y.  The Institute intends to procure this system by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  

Ms. Ringholz will be responsible for data collection, data analysis and generation of draft manuscript related to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP).  This project uses state-based hospital discharge (SID) databases from AHRQ to study the temporal-spatial relationship between incidence of hospital admission from viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in the U.S.   The hospitalization data will be compared with surveillance data for specific pathogens from the CDC and State Health Departments.  Mathematical modeling and statistical packages wil be used to investigate the relationships to the level of zip code, by several age groups and by calendar weeks.  Time series methods will be used to look for interactions and synchronicity between pairs of respiratory pathogens.  This is a continuation of analytical services that Ms. Ringholz has been providing for FIC.  To the best of the Government?s knowledge, Ms. Ringholz is the only known source that can analyze data to explore spatial and temporal relationships between respiratory pathogens, in particular influenza and RSV that we require.

<SUBJECT>66 -- DYNAMIC NUCLEAR POLARIZATION WAVEGUIDE
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIDDK-07-378
<RESPDATE>083107
<ARCHDATE>09152007

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to procure a custom-designed and custom-built Microwave Waveguide from Thomas Keating, Station Mills, Daux Road, Billingshurts, West Sussex, RH14 9SH, England.  The Institute intends to procure this system by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  

The requirements necessary are (1) The system must include corrugated waveguide, taper and horn to provide low-loss transmission (<3db) in the frequency range of at least 262 to 266 GHz; (2) The corrugated waveguide, taper and horn must handle at least 100 mW of microwave power; (3) The corrugated horn should provide an optical transition from the rectangular waveguide mode TE10 of the 264 GHz to the HE11 Gaussian beam mode with the beam size appropriate for the corrugated waveguide; (4) The corrugated horn should physically interface with the output flange (WR-4.3, UG-387/U-M) of the 264 GHz source from Virginia Diodes, Inc.  and provide for positioning on an optical board for a focused Gaussian beam input to a quasi-optical polarizer and transmit any polarization (linear or circular) to the corrugated taper; (6) The corrugated taper should connect to the corrugated waveguide, provide optical focusing of the HE11 Gaussian beam to 2.5 mm diameter and allow for redirection of the beam by 54.7 degrees for ?magic-angle spinning? NMR experiments and (7) The corrugated waveguide and taper must fit in a diameter of 17mm to be compatible with available space within a home-built NMR probe.

These corrugated microwave structures (waveguide, taper and horn) for operation at 264 GHz microwave frequency must be custom-designed and custom-built for the following reasons; (a) The 264 GHz operation frequency is not a standard microwave band; (b)the microwave source and quasi-optical polarizer that will be used in conjunction with these items do not have standard dimensions and operating characteristics;(c) the dimensions and geometry of our existing 9.4 Tesla magnet and home-built NMR probe are not standard and (d) dynamic nuclear polarization is not a standard technique, so standard commercial equipment for dynamic nuclear polarization does not exist.  To the best of the Government?s knowledge, Thomas Keating Ltd, is the only known supplier capable of custom design and custom production of corrugated waveguide components with the dimensions and specifications required by our laboratory.

This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient details to allow NIDDK to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.  Offers must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties and/or other information that demonstrates that the offer meets all of the foregoing requirements.  Two (2) copies of the capability statements and related materials must be received in this office by 5:00p.m. EST on or before August 31, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Request for copies of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) shall be emailed to Tina Robinson robinsti@mail.nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-4226.  It is anticipated that RFQ#  NIH-NIDDK-07-378 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  NOTE: In order to receive an award from the NIDDK, contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov  in order to register.  In addition, contractors must have a valid registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Synopsis for Chemical Steam Generators For A3 Altitude Test Stand at NASA Stennis Space Center The NASA, John C. Stennis Space Center has recently been selected as the test site for the construction of a new A-3 Altitude Test Facility.  The new test facility will provide an altitude propulsion test capability which will enable the Constellation Programs Exploration Launch Office, J-2X Project Element to validate the performance of the J2-X engine for the upper stage of the new Ares I launch vehicle.  The A-3 Altitude Test Facility will be constructed for long term altitude rocket propulsion testing at Stennis Space Center.	  While the construction of the A-3 Altitude Facility will involve a significant number of individual procurement actions this requirement is solely focused on the Chemical Steam Generators.  This pre-solicitation synopsis is to request industry feedback regarding the fabrication, inspection, testing, and delivery of Chemical Steam Generator (CSG) Assemblies to Stennis Space Center.  The fabrication drawings will be provided during the solicitation phase of the procurement. The CSGs will operate with a combustion process using liquid oxygen/isopropyl alcohol and water injection.  Each assembly consists of: 	CSG chamber  	CSG chamber liner 	CSG main stage injector 	CSG first stage igniter 	CSG second stage igniter NASA SSC plans to issue an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for an initial order of 6 CSG Assemblies with the option to add an additional 21 assemblies. This synopsis should not be construed as a formal request for proposals but, rather a pre-solicitation synopsis requesting information under the authority of FAR 15.201.  Responses to this request for information are not offers and cannot be accepted by NASA to form a binding contract.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.	NASA does not intend to award a contract as a result of this Pre-Solicitation Synopsis but will use information obtained for market research analysis and to plan future procurements. NASA desires that those companies expressing an interest in the aforementioned synopsis provide a written Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses high-level alternatives; general, market-based approaches; experience in this area; knowledge of the work involved; and professional and manufacturing resources. The SOC should also contain delivery lead times for components.  The SOC shall not include any confidential business or financial information relating to specific companies. All prospective companies are reminded to direct their written electronic correspondence to the attention of: James D. Huk II at James.D.Huk@NASA.Gov.  Those prospective companies shall have their electronic Statement of Capabilities submitted and received at Stennis Space Center no later than August 31, 2007 at 3: pm CST.  Faxed correspondence and telephone correspondence will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Executive Office of the President intends to award a sole-source contract to the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) pursuant to 41 USC Sec. 253(c)(1), in support of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).  The ONDCP is receiving contractor support to implement The Drug Free Communities (DFC) reauthorization Acts of 2001 and 2006.  CADCA has five years of direct hands on experience with providing large scale support to the Drug-Free Communities (DFC) program, its grantees, and project officers and to the federal organization responsible for the management of the Drug-Free Communities Support Program. During this five year period, CADCA has created an infrastructure for the National Coalition to fulfill the Congressional Mandate to:

a. Provide education, training, and technical assistance for coalition leaders and community teams, with emphasis on the development of coalitions serving economically
disadvantaged areas;

b. Develop and disseminate evaluation tools, mechanisms, and measures to better assess and document coalition performance measures and outcomes; and

c. Bridge the gap between research and practice by translating knowledge from research into practical information.

CADCA?s current contracting vehicle will expire in September 2007.  The Executive Office of the President will award a 1-year contract for the continuation of services.  

There are currently over 740 grantees that rely on this system for support provided by the DFC. The resultant contract will provide grantees crucial support, such as conducting New Grantee Trainings for all grantees coming into the DFC system, and assisting with Grant Application Workshops.

The required Professional Scientific Research Device, of which NAMRL only requires one (1) , will reside at NAMRL's relocated facility at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio and must possess all of the following requirements:  (1) Six Degrees of Freedom to include: continuous yaw, pitch, and roll beyond 360 dg displacement; peak velocity not less that 150 dg/s; peak acceleration not less than 60 dg/s2; ability for above to occur in a head-centered axis for +/- 2 standard deviation male or female; and ability for simultaneous rotation in the three axes above (or choices of one, two, or three axes simultaneously); (2) Vertical and Horizontal Linear Acceleration of not less than 400 lb payload at not less than .5 G to include:  capability for pure horizontal linear acceleration of amplitude greater than or equal to 20 feet diameter and less than or equal to 50 feet diameter; and capability for pure vertical linear acceleration of amplitude great or equal to 5 feet and less than or equal to 12 feet; (3) Off-center Rotation to include: capability for off-center rotation at not less than 10 feet radius (or more than 25 feet) from center; capability for controlled counter-rotation of capsule during off-center rotation; and capability for acceleration of central axis at not less than 15 dg/s2; (4) Motion in Multiple Degrees-of-Freedom to include: capability for simultaneous off-center rotation during linear accelerations (horizontal, vertical, or both) along entire usable diameter of the horizontal or linear track (In the case of horizontal linear acceleration, this would require moving through the center of rotation to the other side of the track); and capability for simultaneous yaw, pitch, and roll rotation within the capsule's axis during off-center rotation and linear acceleration (horizontal, vertical, or both) of the capsule, (5) High G with Good Acceleration to include: must be capable of approximately 3G when subject is at maximum radius during off-center rotation; and acceleration to approximately 3G in at least 5 seconds; (6) Integrated Visual Display to include:  field of view as close to human limits as possible, esp. in horizontal plane; and visual display configurable for different experiments so that display behavior can coordinate with motion stimulus, such as would be necessary for simulation experiments or experiments on visual-vestibular integration of sensory information; and (7) Man-in-the-Loop or capability for on-board personnel to supply control inputs, such as might be used in simulation experiments.  The device must be man-rated to 3G and certified operational for human test subjects.  The device must be manufactured, delivered, installed, man-rated, and operational 30 months after contract award in order to ensure that research vital to the Navy continues uninterrupted.  The proposed acquisition is for a supply for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  AMST is the only known source capable of manufacturing and installing a single device that meets all the minimum needs of the Government as expressed above.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information and/or challenges to the sole source acquisition strategy received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  Numbered note 26 applies.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Biostatistics Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1), services from the Dr. Amr Soliman, Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, 109 S. Observatory, Room 2550, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 for the study entitled ?A case-control study of inflammatory breast cancer in North Africa and France? which will assess risk factors for Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC).

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(B)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, poorly understood and particularly aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by diffuse erythema and edema/peau d?orange of the breast.  This acquisition will assess risk factors for IBC and will include approximately 400 IBC cases accrued at 6 centers in North Africa (1 center in Tunisia, 1 in Egypt, 2 in Algeria, and 2 in Morocco) and 1 center in France.  Two control groups will be included: 1) 400 non-IBC breast cancer cases and; 2) 400 visitor controls (excluding first-degree relatives) to randomly selected female inpatients (excluding those with breast, ovarian, endometrial, and pediatric cancers) in the study cancer hospitals.  The study will involve the administration of a questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, blood collection on filter paper, saliva collection, digital photographs of the breasts of IBC cases, and the collection of paraffin-embedded tumor tissue for IBC cases and non-IBC breast cancer cases at selected centers. The study will be conducted as a consortium, with form development and translation centered at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).  The proposed study is an expansion of the pilot study of inflammatory breast cancer in Egypt and Tunisia. Dr. Soliman is the liaison to the investigators at the study hospitals and developed the procedures for the pilot study, which was designed to identify IBC cases at the study institutions in Egypt and Tunisia.  He has a unique relationship with the study investigators in the institutions in Egypt and Tunisia which makes Amr Soliman the only known source for this project.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis in accordance with 13.106-(b)(1) with H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, 12902 Magnolia Drive, MRC-CANCONT, Tampa, FL 33612-9416; services to collect and process serial oral rinse specimens from 4500 study visits and store the specimens at -80 for future HPV DNA testing.  

Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is strongly associated with the development of invasive cervical, vulvar, and anal cancers in women, and penile and anal cancers in men (Cogliano V, Baan R, Straif K, Grosse Y, Secretan B, El Ghissassi F. Carcinogenicity of human papillomaviruses. Lancet Oncol 2005;6:204.)  HPV16 is also associated cancers of the oropharynx (Cogliano V, Baan R, Straif K, Grosse Y, Secretan B, El Ghissassi F. Carcinogenicity of human papillomaviruses. Lancet Oncol 2005;6:204.); recent data suggests that HPV16 is an etiologic factor for more than 50% of oropharyngeal cancers (D'Souza G, Kreimer AR, Viscidi R, Pawlita M, Fakhry C, Koch WM, Westra WH, Gillison ML. Case control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer. NEJM 2007 (19):1944-56.)

The purpose of this procurement is to investigate whether HPV infections at different anatomic sites are linked.  To do so, we plan to conduct a large study to determine the timing of incident HPV16 infection and subsequent clearance in the oral region and anogenital tract among cancer-free individuals participating in two on-going, international, clinic-based studies being conducted by Dr. Anna Giuliano at the Moffitt Cancer Center.  By nesting this work in an on-going study, we can efficiently and effectively evaluate our hypotheses and determine if a larger study is warranted.  This study will be nested in an international (US, Mexico, Brazil), prospective study of the natural history of anogenital HPV Infection in Men (the HIM study), which already has a nested component that aims to evaluate HPV heterosexual transmission (The HPV International Transmission [HIT] Study) by enrolling the partners of the men in the HIM study.  These on-going studies offer the ideal infrastructure to investigate oral HPV infection; approximately 1500 men will be followed every 6 months for 4 years for a total of 10 study visits and approximately 750 female partners will be evaluated every 6 months for a total of 2 years for a total of 5 study visits.  The period of performance shall be for one year from date of award.

The H. Lee Moffit Cancer Center and Research Institute in the laboratory of Dr. Anna Giuliano commenced enrollment for the HIM study in 2005.  To date, the research infrastructure is well-established; the parent study rigorously tracks, organizes, and monitors the collection, processing, and storage of each of the anogenital specimens and corresponding laboratory analyses.  This will be expanded to include the oral rinse specimens.  From this study, there will be access to the data on the anogenital HPV status of the study population, which in turn will enable us to test the most pertinent oral specimens, those which have HPV16 positivity in the anogenital region.  Completing this project will provide data on the feasibility of specimen collection, adequacy of DNA in the specimens, and estimates of oral HPV infection in men and women with anogenital HPV16 infection.   In turn, we can begin to evaluate the relative timing of HPV infection in the oral and anogenital region, and among concurrently infected individuals, to assess the timing of HPV clearance.  We will use this information to determine if a larger study is feasible.  The Moffitt Cancer Center and the laboratory of Dr. Anna Giuliano has the only on-going study in which to nest our prospective evaluation of oral HPV among anogenitally HPV infected men and women.  The research infrastructure is already in place.  To maintain continuity in an on-going research project and avoid introducing new variables into the project, it is of critical importance that the procedures be conducted in the same laboratory so that there is no intra-laboratory variation.  Assuring no intra-laboratory variation is essential to allow comparability the results.   

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole-source basis, in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University of  Wisconsin at Madison, 1525 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706-1596; services to identify host and viral biomarkers that will distinguish those women with HPV infections that are likely to clear infection from those that are likely to have persistent infection and progress to cervical cancer.  The Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED) is being conducted to identify host and viral biomarkers that would molecularly distinguish women "at risk" of progressive cervical neoplasia.  

The procurement will expand previous contracts where SUCCEED tissue specimens were evaluated and answer critical scientific questions for which SUCCEED was designed to address.  In addition to expanding the number of SUCCEED specimens evaluated for host and HPV expression from the microdissected epithelial cells, this requirement will include evaluation of the adjacent stromal cells, which currently remain frozen at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.  As has been done with epithelial cells to date, the University of Wisconsin at Madison shall extract RNA from the stromal cells and evaluate gene expression with the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 human genome microarray and the University of Wisconsin at Madison's in-house human papillomavirus expression array.  In addition, this requirement seeks to further expand the evaluation of microdissected epithelial cells to include microRNA expression using the University of Wisconsin at Madison's in-house microRNA expression array.  Services shall be provided for one year from the date of award.

Handling of specimens in an identical manner as those handled under the previous contract is mandatory and essential for the scientific integrity and validity of the project.  All data elements obtained under the present contract must also be identical to the data elements obtained under the previous contract for combined analysis.  The specimens under the proposed contract and with those handled in the previous contract can not be handled or evaluated differently since their results are intended for a single combined analysis.  The same techniques and assays must be applied to all specimens equally in order to obtain standardized and scientifically sound results across all specimens so that results can be evaluated in totality.  In addition, the HPV chip and the microRNA chip are unique to the University of Wisconsin at Madison.  The University of Wisconsin at Madison is the only known source with an HPV chip that has the ability to detect unintegrated HPV DNA.  Both the HPV chip and the microRNA chip are produced solely by the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the utilization of these assays is integral to the analysis of SUCCEED specimens for host and viral expression.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) plans to enter into a sole source basis procurement in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1),  with Guillermo Perez-Perez Laboratory, New York University Medical Center, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016 for laboratory assays to measure antibodies to H. pylori Whole Cell and CagA antigen on up to 640 PLCO stored serum samples. 
Antibodies will be measured to H. pylori Whole Cell and CagA antigen on up to 640 PLCO stored serum samples. Serum will be evaluated for IgG antibodies to whole-cell (WC) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum samples will be assayed in duplicate, and the results expressed as optical density ratios relative to simultaneously analyzed laboratory standards. An antigen-specific ELISA will be used to determine serum levels of IgG antibodies to H. pylori using a preparation of sonicated whole cells of five clinical H. pylori isolates.  An absorbance index (AI) will be calculated from mean absorbance at 405 nm of two assays per sample, in relation to reference sera.  A previously validated cutoff point of AI > 1.0 will be used to define H. pylori positivity.  When two assayed aliquots provided indeterminate results (i.e., the values straddle the seropositivity threshold), additional aliquots will be analyzed and the average of all results will be used to determine serologic status. CagA status will be determined by an ELISA based on the presence of serum IgG antibodies against orv220, a 65,000 Dalton recombinant cagA-encoded protein purified from Escherichia coli..  CagA positivity (representing carriage of a cagA+ strain) will be defined as an optical density > 0.35, as validated previously.  The samples will be stored at -70 degrees Centigrade. Period of performance shall be for one year from date of award. 
Guillermo Perez-Perez Laboratory, New York University Medical Center is the only source known to the NCI Measure antibodies to H. pylori Whole Cell and CagA antigen on up to 640 PLCO stored serum samples which will meet the research needs of the project in a manner consistent with prior studies. To maintain continuity in on-going research projects and avoid introducing new variables into the project, it is of critical importance that the procedures be conducted in the same laboratory so that there is no variation or interpretation of the results.  Assuring no intra-laboratory variation is essential to maintain validity of the overall evaluation.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) plans to procure on a sole source basis in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University of Washington, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, 825 Eastlake Ave East, Seattle, WA 98109, services regarding:  Breast MRI Use in Community Practice: Assessment of Delivery, Quality and Outcomes in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC).

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain expert investigation into the current state of MRI in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC).  Recent guidelines have recommended screening breast MRI as an adjunct to mammography in women at particularly high risk for breast cancer.  However, there are generally sparse or no data to support the use of breast MRI for other clinical scenarios, such as to guide decision making regarding a suspicious finding on clinical examination or mammography, or to screen women at average or at increased but less than 20% lifetime risk for cancer. In addition, there are limitations and potential harms associated with breast MRI.  The use of the BCSC data collection infrastructure and large patient database will allow a unique and important evaluation of the practice of breast MRI in community settings. A small number of data variables regarding MRI use are now collected and recorded in the BCSC database. The formation of a dedicated BCSC working group for the assessment breast MRI and collection of a greater number of variables will greatly enhance the ability to perform a comprehensive and meaningful assessment of the key characteristics of this new technology. The contractor will organize core BCSC personnel and develop the appropriate data variables to optimally evaluate delivery, quality and outcomes of breast MRI in community practice. The contractor will also, in collaboration with the Breast MRI assessment working group, evaluate the currently collected data variables related to breast MRI and develop additional data variables and data collection tools for the 2008 data submission, in collaboration with the Statistical Coordinating Center. The University of Washington, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance has extensive relevant research experience in the use of breast MRI, including participating in a multi-site American College of Radiology Imaging Network study to evaluate the role of MRI in detecting occult cancer, several National Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium trials, and International Breast Magnetic Resonance Consortium (IBMC)/Cancer Genetics Network pilot high risk screening study.  Period of performance shall be for one year from date of award.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, 14225 Newbrook Drive, Chantilly, Virginia to measure serum levels of the Prolactin (PRL) hormone using the ADVIA Centaur PRL assay using cases and controls from the Polish Breast Cancer Study.  PRL is a hormone responsible for growth and development of the normal human breast and high PRL levels in serum have been associated with breast cancer risk factors including: nulliparity, oral contraceptive use, and family history of breast cancer.  In addition, increased serum levels of PRL have been associated with increased breast cancer risk especially among ER+ breast cancer cases (1, 2).  This procurement will build upon current research on hormones and hormone receptors in the Polish breast cancer study and allow a more complete mechanistic understanding of the relationship between serum levels of PRL ligand with breast cancer risk and tumor characteristics.  Results from this work could elucidate hormone dependent mechanisms of carcinogenesis.  The contractor shall measure PRL levels in 1740 serum samples (from 791 cases, 791 controls and 158 quality controls samples) provided by NCI investigators using the ADVIA Centaur Prolactin assay.  The ADVIA Centaur Prolactin assay is a two-site sandwich immunoassay using direct chemiluminometric technology, which uses constant amounts of two antibodies. The first antibody, in the Lite Reagent, is a polyclonal goat anti-PRL antibody labeled with acridinium ester. The second antibody, in the Solid Phase, is a monoclonal mouse anti-PRL antibody, which is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles.  Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute labs is uniquely qualified to perform this work in the required time and the large number of samples. Quest Diagnostics routinely performs PRL serum assays on a daily bases and is the only known contractor capable of measuring the 1740 blood sample assays. The PRL assay requires an experienced laboratory with diagnostic expertise because of the technical complexities and standards involved. The assays are available in individual laboratories but they are not set up to perform the volume of samples and time frame required.  All services must be completed by April 30, 2008.  In addition, Quest Diagnostics possesses unique expertise and resources for performing PRL serum assays which is critical for the success of our ongoing efforts to identify hormonally related risk factors of breast cancer and the potential association with genetic variants in the same hormone and receptor genes.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1155 Pressler Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030 to analyze lymphocyte samples in order to assess ability to repair DNA damage, using the mutagen sensitivity DNA repair assay.  The mutagen sensitivity DNA repair assays measure the number of chromatid breaks using metaphase spreads in lymphocyte cultures from 432  samples in the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study.  The Spanish Bladder Cancer (SBC) study is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort between investigators at DCEG and epidemiologists and laboratory investigators at the Institut Municipal d'Investigacio' Me'dica (IMIM) in Barcelona, Spain. SBC is a large hospital-based case-control study with very high participation rates, high quality DNA, and detailed and innovative exposure assessment. The Spanish study combines state-of-the-art exposure assessment using a computer-assisted interview and collection of biological specimens. Using the SBC study we have been evaluating genetic susceptibility factors for bladder cancer and the interaction of those factors with environmental and occupational exposures.  The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center shall: 1) Perform 432 mutagen sensitivity assays using cyropreserved lymphocytes provided by NCI investigators.  Lymphocyte cells will be fixed and stained with Giemsa solution to visualize chromosomes.  Fifty metaphase spreads will be examined in each sample to determine the number of chromatid breaks, and the average number of breaks per cell will be determined.  A minimum of 50 well-spread metaphases per sample will be read.  Detailed reading criteria and examples of various types of breakage have been developed;  2) Laboratory Data Quality control:  Researchers performing the assays will be blinded to the subject case control lymphocyte samples. To evaluate assay reproducibility we will include blinded duplicate samples.  A single brand of fetal calf serum and culture bottles will be used as culture medium.  The lot numbers of all reagents and chemicals will be recorded.  The incubator temperature and carbon dioxide concentration will also be recorded each day to ensure that the culture conditions are uniform.  For the mutagen sensitivity assay readings, a single cytogenetist will perform the readings for each assay to minimize inter-reader variation.  M.D. Anderson is uniquely qualified to perform this work. They have successfully performed these mutagen sensitivity assays on cryopreserved lymphocytes from bladder cancer cases and controls from their study population and has shown that these assays also indicate susceptibility differences between cancer cases and controls.  The current request is the continuation and expansion of the previous effort to understand the role of DNA repair genetic variation as a susceptibility factor for bladder cancer risk. The mutagen sensitivity requires an experienced laboratory with a strong cell biology background because of the technical difficulties. M.D. Anderson pioneered and validated this state-of-the-art technology. In addition, M.D. Anderson mutagen sensitivity assays are not offered commercially and only they possess the unique expertise and resources for the mutagen sensitivity assays, which is crucial for the success of our ongoing efforts to identify susceptibility phenotypes and functional genetic variants associated with bladder cancer risk.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Yale University School of Medicine, 310 Cedar Street, PO Box 208023, New Haven, CT 06520 to perform Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) of immunofluorescent stains using antibodies for estrogen receptor coregulators.  Staining would be performed on tissue micrarrays (TMAs) prepared from invasive breast carcinomas collected in the Polish Breast Cancer Case-Control Study. 

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The Tissue Microarray (TMA) technique, which permits the analysis of hundreds of tissue samples simultaneously using just a few slides, is ideally suited for epidemiological studies.  Yale University has successfully built TMAs for 1761 (842 cases in TMA1 and 919 in TMA2) invasive breast cancer tissues collected from the Polish Breast Cancer Study.  The first set of TMAs (TMA1) has been stained for four markers (ER-??, ER-??, PR and HER2) using Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA?) analyses. This work demonstrated AQUA analyses of tumors represented in TMAs provide reliable, quantitative measures of immunofluorescent, which can be used to advance research on differences in cancer etiology based on stratification of tumors by marker expression.  In a continuation of this on-going study Yale University School of Medicine shall: 1) Perform AQUA analysis of TMA1 containing tissue samples from 842 Polish breast cancers with two-fold redundancy (i.e. 1,684 cores) for SRC3/AIB1, NCOR1, and NCRO2/SMRT; and 2) Perform AQUA analysis of TMA2 containing tissue samples from 919 cases with three-fold redundancy (i.e. 2,757 cores) for SRC3/AIB1, NCOR1, NCRO2/SMRT and ER-??.  These activities are required in order to: 1) identify molecular subtypes of breast cancer; 2) evaluate associations between tumor subtypes defined by marker expression and risk factors for breast cancer; and 3) evaluate associations between tumor subtypes defined by marker expression and survival and prognosis of breast cancer patients.  Yale University is the only vendor known to the NCI Researcher that can perform the required AQUA analysis without the introduction of new variables in on-going research.  The laboratory of Dr. David Rimm at Yale University Medical School is uniquely qualified to perform this work. Yale has successfully prepared TMAs of 1,761 invasive breast cancers collected from the Polish Breast Cancer Study and performed AQUA staining of five markers on a subset of TMAs from 842 cases under previous orders (MQ217406; MQ317189; MQ515652). The current request is the continuation and expansion of the previous effort for arrays of invasive breast cancer tissues. The AQUA staining of invasive breast tissues requires an experienced laboratory with strong pathology consultation because of the technical difficulties. Yale has pioneered and validated this state-of-the-art technology. In addition, Yale has constructed and cut the TMAs that will be stained under this procurement, and has demonstrated high quality data derived from tissue samples collected in the Polish Breast Cancer Study. In short, Yale possesses unique expertise and resources for staining TMAs using the AQUA system, which is critical for the success of our ongoing efforts to identify etiologically distinct subtypes of breast cancer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>I.  Objective.  The work to be performed under this purchase order consists of furnishing all labor, materials, supplies and equipment necessary for draining of Beneficial Use Sites  1A and 4A in Chocolate Bay, Texas to facilitate the interior planting of Spartina  alterniflora (S. alternifora) and Spartina patens (S. patens). II.  Project Site.  The project site is Chocolate Bay Beneficial Use Site 1A located near  the western upstream side of the confluence between Chocolate Bayou and the  Intracoastal Waterway and is shown on Sheets 1 and 3 of the attached drawings.   Beneficial Site 4A is located about 1.5 miles downstream of the FM 2004 bridge over  Chocolate Bayou and is also shown on Sheets 1 and 2. III. Description of Work.  Install a commercially available agricultural flashboard riser  made of galvanized steel in Placement Area 4A and 1A as shown in the drawings to drain  the existing interior water.  Install the flashboard riser to a depth of the existing interior  bottom mudline to allow a corrugated metal pipe of no less than 18 inches in diameter  through the existing levee in PA 4A and through the existing geotextile tubes in  Placement Area 1A.       A.	 Beneficial Use Site 1A:  Geotextile tubes shall be cut at the location  shown and enough interior material extracted from the tube so the discharge pipe of  the flashboard riser will fit and lay at the proper slope for appropriate interior  drainage.  The ends of the geotextile tubes once enough material is vacated shall have the ends resewn to prevent further loss of fill material.  The placement of the headwall of the flashboard riser will be as close to the interior line of geotextile tube s as possible.  A metal grated ramp rated for at least 500lbs of load capacity shall be placed to access the board risers.  The riser channels shall be of sufficient width to accommodate only the thickness of a commercially available treated 2-inch x 4-inc h No. 2 board.  The area cut from the geotextile tubes will be back filled with 50lb concrete mix filled marine bags.   The concrete bags shall be neatly stacked over the discharge  pipe and riser structure base to an elevation of the surrounding geotextile tube.  The discharge end shall have enough pipe length to discharge at least 5 feet away from the base of the geotextile tube.      B.	Beneficial Use Site 4A:  The levees shall be cut at the location shown and  a flashboard riser placed at the appropriate elevation to allow for adequate drainage of  the interior of the placement area to facilitate planting.  The cut material shall be  stockpiled in the dry and used to backfill the pipe and structure once installed.  The  horizontal offset of the headwall of the flashboard riser shall be as close as possible to  the interior slope of the earth levee.  Sufficient discharge pipe shall be added to the  basic structure to allow for drainage past the outside slope of the levee.  The area  where the pipe runs through the levee shall be backfilled with the stockpiled material  and sufficiently packed to prevent seepage through the earth and pipe interface.  A  metal grated ramp rated for at least 500lbs of load capacity shall be placed to access  the board risers.  The riser channels shall be of sufficient width to accommodate only  the thickness of a commercially available treated 2-inch x 4-inch No. 2 board.    C.	Repair of breach on Placement Area 4A.  The breach on the earthen levee  on placement area 4A on the location shown on the drawings shall be repaired and  restored to the surrounding levee conditions.  An estimated 4CY of material in needed  to restore the breach.  A photograph of the breach is included. IV.	   General Instructions.   The contractor is responsible for providing all equipment,  labor, and materials to complete work described in this Scope of Work including  mobilization and demobilization to the job site, which is remote.  In addition, it i s the  responsibility of the Contractor to be familiar with the site conditions and weather  forecasts (including tide changes) during the project.  Tides may impact the Contractor's  ability to access the site.   The Contractor shall take precautionary measures to ensure  success of the job and appropriate installation of the agricultural board risers. 	The Contractor shall be aware that there may be colonial waterbird nesting in the  two sites.

<br/>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for establishing large scale, coordinated Systems Biology Programs that utilize a combination of computational and experimental methodologies to conduct research Projects to analyze, identify, quantify, model and predict the overall dynamics of the network of cellular molecular components of microbial organisms and their interactions with the host cells.<br/>
Description<br/> 

<br/>Each research Project of the Systems Biology Program shall concurrently utilize multiple high-throughput ?-omics? technologies to generate a diversity of experimental data. These experimental data shall be collected and integrated to develop and/or validate computational models of the molecular interaction networks involved in the biological processes under investigation.<br/>  

<br/>The resources generated by the System Biology Program shall be made publicly available and easily accessible to the scientific community through public data, software and reagent repositories and through web portals The ultimate goal of the Systems Biology Program is to enhance knowledge of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical and biophysical molecular processes in microbial organisms and host cells which may lead to the initiation and progression of infectious diseases. Such information should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of antimicrobial drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, thus potentially translating basic research findings into clinical applications.<br/>

<br/>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  10.45 FTEs.<br/>

<ARCHDATE>03312008
<CONTACT>Karen Shelley, (937) 904-4217
<DESC>DRAFT SOO Info (17 Aug 07): The attached draft IBSP Statement of Objectives (SOO) is being released  for Industry comment. In the next two weeks we will also be releasing the  draft System Requirement Document, a draft Section M and a draft Section L  for Industry comment.   Please send written comments to Ms Karen Shelley  (Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil) and in the r-mail subject line please add the  name of the document to which the comments refer (EX:  SOO - Comments,  SRD - Comments). Be advised, that it is likely that the complete DRFP release will be  delayed until Sep and RFP release not until Oct.  If you have any  questions, you can contact the acting program manager, George Sarmiento,  at his new e-mail address:  george.sarmiento2@wpafb.af.mil or myself. Additional Information (29 Jun 07): T-38C Improved Braking System Program (IBSP) Drawings Available Upon  Request The drawings referenced in section two of the wheel and brake notional  system/testing baseline for the T-38C IBSP are now available.  To request  a copy, please email Karen Shelley at Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil. Addition Information (29 Jun 07): The attached questions and answers were taken from Panel Discussions at  T-38C IBSP Industry Days on 12 Jun 07. Addition Information: The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year  risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key  envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements.  The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in  the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the  interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and  propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance  specifications. 1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide  answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide  any additional information to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence to Attn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mail brandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager (937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response  to no more than 10 single-sided 8 ½ x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point  font size. 1 Attachment RFI Questions Attachment 1 RFI Questions 1.	Describe your present technical capability and past aircraft-specific history of meeting similar requirements. 2.	Describe in some detail your companys proposed approach for meeting  this requirement. 3.	Identify any commercial item solutions that your company will  incorporate into proposed design. 4.	Identify any non-developmental solutions currently used on military aircraft that your company will incorporate into proposed design. 5.	Describe what portion of the proposed work will be accomplished  in-house versus subcontracting. 6.	Describe the technical risk and problem areas for this requirement, including any anticipated interfaces/technical inputs required to  implement a (system) solution. 7.	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and timeline (proposed schedule) of major milestones. 8.	Describe proposed support approach 9.

<DESC>Solicitation N1577070010 THIS IS NOT A MODIFICATION / AMENDMENTS Question(s) and Answer(s) 1.I''m interesting in knowing whether or not this solicitation has a real estate/land consulting component, or if it strictly deals with consulting on the management efficiency of the park operations.  Can you provide any clarification on this point? ANSWER: It is not real estate/land consulting - We awarded the previous contract via a GSA procurement.  It was originally competed under the GSA Ebuy site within Small Businesses. 2.  I was wondering when you expect to release the RFP N1577070010 - Management & Organizational Consultation and Facilitation Services, and how much time you expect we will have to respond?? ANSWER: Solicitation will be out by 27 July with a closing due in our office approximately August 30, 2007. Anticipated date of award is September 12, 2007. 3.  The notice I found made reference to a Statement of Work but I was unable to find that document.  Can you point me in the right direction? ANSWER: The presolicitation notice is letting the Acquisition world know that there will be a solicitation (statement of work is included in the solicitation) coming out shortly.  Shortly usually means within 14 days or longer we will issue a solicitation.  If you are new to contracting be aware that you must be registered within the CCR (Central Contractor Registration) http://www.ccr.gov/ database to be awarded this possible gov't contract. Any questions generated by this solicitation will be posted on the FBO page for all Vendors to see. 4.  In reading the Solicitation document, it references on pg. 21 the National Park Service Core Operations Analysis, begun in 2005.  Can you provide me with information on this and its relationship to the SOW?  Is there a document I can reference? ANSWER; Our mistake in using words that are interagency understood.  Basically, the National Park Service Core Operations Analysis, 2005 is taking current fiscal budget / cost and projecting a 5 year forecast of future availability of these funds. 5.  Regarding solicitation N1577070010: Section B-2 of the solicitation specifies a ceiling for services of $55,000/year.  The date of that paragraph is April 1984. Is that limit accurate and in place?  Is there an incumbent and, if so, what rate was in place in the last contract? ANSWER:  There is an incumbent and the ceiling rate was not used in the previous contract.  We competed the previous contract within the GSA schedule.  Ellen Cull was the incumbent and her rates are located on the GSA page under her contract terms and conditions GS10F0339R.  This year the DOI-Yellowstone chose to compete this contract within the small business arena instead of issuing a BPA with GSA for various consultant services.  We felt that there would be adequate competition within this market to issue a contract, instead of a BPA with GSA. The GSA Contract may be viewed on the GSA website:  GS10F0339R Ellen M Cull, 1604 Newton Street NE, Washington, DC 20018-2318 (Women Owned Small Business-incumbent) 6. I have read through the above mentioned solicitation.  I am familiar with the National Park Service Core Operations Analysis and the need for Yellowstone to operate within a smaller budget.  I understand the focus day meetings.  I read that the consultant chosen to work with Yellowstone  will provide consultation and facilitation services.  However, what I do not understand is what Yellowstone hopes to attain with such a professional relationship.  Are there specific goals, financial or otherwise that they want to improve?  Are those metrics measurable?  In other words, what specific problem(s) are looking to be addressed?  I need to know in order to see if my firm's goals and missions match up with that of the National Park Service. ANSWER:  We expect the successful bidder to bring us a skill set that will help us define and achieve success in our Focus Days and other meetings (by their application of those skills through consultation and facilitation services).  The first paragraph under "Focus Days" to zero in on three goals:  management strategies; implementation of efficiencies; and organizational realignment.  Other examples are listed in the "Other meetings/consultation" section.

The Contractor will define, establish, document, and implement a Continued Airworthiness Program (CAP) to predict and prevent fatigue separations.  

The CAP must: contain: 

1.	Define and describe the contractor's airworthiness program and how it meets the exhibit requirements.

2.	Insure that the aircraft has been issued a Standard or Restricted certificate by the FAA.

3.	Meet the intent of developing a maintenance and inspection program specific to their airtanker fleet.

4.	Submit documents for FAA approved Instructions for Continued Airworthiness in accordance with FAR 25.1529 at Amendment Level 54 or later, and be based on the FAA Type certification. 

Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) are maintenance actions defined by the TC or STC holder in accordance with 14 CFR 25.1529 and delivered with the airplane or provided by the manufacturer. ICA's are documented information that includes applicable methods, inspections, processes, procedures and airworthiness limitations.


1.	Obtain documentation of manufacturer support for maintenance of the aircraft while the vendor is operating their aircraft in the firefighting role. 

2.	Include an evaluation of the airtanker structure (airframe and tank) to FAR 25.571 at Amendment Level 96 or later.  

Amendment 96 of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 25.571 requires that it ?be demonstrated with sufficient full-scale test evidence that WFD will not occur within the design service goal of the airplane. It requires special consideration for WFD and requires full scale fatigue testing have been completed on a same model airframe.  The corresponding Advisory Circular (AC) 25.571-1C provides general guidelines on the requirements and recommends rigorous posttest teardown inspections as a way to generate sufficient evidence. However, AC 25.571-1C does not specify the teardown protocol, inspection procedures, data collection, and subsequent analyses. Comprehensive guidelines and data that are documented and available to the broader aviation community are lacking. It would require that an LOV (or DSG) be established for the airframe.  


1.	Install and monitor an aircraft Operational Load Monitoring (OLM) system for the purpose of updating and improving the continued airworthiness of the Contractor's aircraft.  

2	Provide for the Contractor to submit revised ICA's to the FAA for approval based on the operation of the aircraft as an airtanker using the data collected from the OLM system.  The revised ICA would be based on either an analysis similar to that used in FAA certification or a combination of analysis used for FAA certification and data obtained from firefighting operations.  As a minimum, revised ICA's would be submitted prior to the 3rd year of the contract.  Copies of the package submitted to the FAA will be sent to the Contracting Officer.

3.	Explain how a quality assurance program will be put in place to insure that the Contractor can predict and prevent fatigue separations.

<DESC>I.	Purpose: The purpose of the SIR is to seek competent and suitable sources for the subject project.  Responses to the SIR will be used to screen qualified companies. Screening information allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine which offers are more likely to receive award, and ultimately, which offers will provide the FAA with the best value.

<SUBJECT>A -- Toward Maximizing the Scientific Value of the Biologic Specimens from the Women's Health Initiative II
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NHLBI-WHI-SS-09-01
<RESPDATE>090107
<ARCHDATE>09012007
<CONTACT>Paul McFarlane, Chief, ECA/WHI Branch, Phone 301-435-0345, Fax 301-480-3430, Email pmcfarlane@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND

The NIH has supported collection of blood samples and clinical data from participants in the three clinical trials and the observational study of the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI) since 1993.  This well-characterized population provides a rare and valuable scientific resource maintained under contracts between NHLBI and the WHI centers.  Promoting optimal use on a national scale of such a resource requires a large and concerted effort which may exceed the research capacities of individual study locations, and of WHI as a whole.  The NHLBI and the researchers it supports have a responsibility to the public in general, and the scientific community in particular, to encourage the most rapid scientific progress possible using these resources.  In order to take full advantage of such resources and to maximize their research value, it is important that samples and data collected with public funds be made available, with the least amount of restrictions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.

NHLBI and NIH programs were reviewed to determine whether existing projects will satisfy the requirement, and the proposed activity was discussed with key staff in NHLBI and other NIH Institutes to determine that this BAA does not replicate other efforts.  The WHI resource is unique in its scope, focus on diseases of older women, ethic and racial diversity, and in particular in that it includes several large randomized controlled clinical trials which are capable of yielding information that cannot be obtained from observational studies.  Care will be taken to ensure that the investigations under this BAA will not duplicate those already performed by the WHI investigators and their colleagues.

The original WHI study population included 161,808 postmenopausal women in the United States, 68,132 (42%) of whom were randomized to one or more components of the clinical trial (CT), and 93,676 (58%) of whom were enrolled in the observational study (OS) between 1993 and 1998.  Recruitment criteria included being 50-79 years of age, being post-menopausal, and planning to live in the area of a given Clinical Center (CC) for three years, with specific exclusionary criteria for the Dietary Modification (DM) and Hormone Therapy (HT) Trial components. Specific study goals were set for ethnic distribution (20% minority women in the CT) and age distribution (30% for 50-59 years of age; 45% for 60-69; 25% for 70-79).  Table 1 shows the number of participating women by baseline age and race/ethnicity.  The numbers are given for the CT and OS separately and combined since proposals may include efforts to comprehensively evaluate the effects of CT interventions as well as observational studies in the combined CT and OS.  The original cohort was followed until March 31, 2005, after which subjects were invited to enroll in the WHI Extension Study from 2005 to 2010. As of August 2006 there were 115,273 women (77% of eligibles) enrolled in the Extension Study, during which ascertainment of outcomes (including activities of daily life) has continued together with limited exposure data on use of hormone therapy, calcium/vitamin D supplements, and 24-hour recall of food intake (in a subset). 

ACQUISITION PLAN

This acquisition will employ a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals that will maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data in the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI), by soliciting the best ideas for laboratory-based research studies to apply to the WHI biologic resource.  This second solicitation follows on a first solicitation issued in January, 2006. That BAA solicitation resulted in the award of 12 contracts, each of a 2-year duration, awarded in January 2007. WHI collected extensive information on multiple outcomes, including any disease leading to overnight hospitalization, cancers, self-report of a number of additional conditions, measures of cognition/dementia, sleep, and functional status, amongst others. For this second BAA solicitation, proposals utilizing the data on any of the phenotypes or groups of phenotypes will be considered.  It is anticipated that the research programs funded by this BAA will include applications of genomics, proteomics, and other laboratory investigations to the existing frozen samples of DNA, serum, plasma, red blood cells, and urine.  The BAA will not fund new data collection and will make use of existing biologic specimens.

In general, the BAA seeks innovative technologies that enable comprehensive, yet efficient, investigation of sets of markers associated with disease outcomes or treatment effects, or of groups of mediators that might substantively explain the pathway of exposure or treatment effects on disease. For example, genomic studies might include whole-genome and haplotype approaches and studies of sets of functional genes with related effects on an outcome.  Studies that combine information from genes and gene products in the form of blood proteins could help to elucidate pathways.  Studies on serum or plasma might include multiplex assays of a panel of markers, for example adipokines or cytokines, which allow a large number of markers to be tested using a modest amount of sample.  On the other hand, focused studies on a more limited number of candidate genes or candidate markers will be considered if there are reasonably strong data supporting large effects from these individual markers that need to be confirmed in a large dataset, and their validation has potential public health implications. 

Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) are used by agencies to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state-of-the art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific solution.  Proposals received under this BAA will be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria as specified in the solicitation, through a peer review process.  Proposals will not be evaluated against a specific Government need, as in the case of a conventional request for proposals (RFP), as they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.

In addition to the mechanism envisaged by this BAA, investigators may also gain access to the WHI data (including study data not related to the biologic resource) through an established ancillary study mechanism by collaborating with one or more WHI investigators.  A portion of the biologic resource not reserved for the BAA is otherwise reserved, and therefore studies that are not suitable for funding through the BAA may be proposed for funding through a variety of other mechanisms.  Such ancillary studies are reviewed by the relevant WHI committees and by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and if approved can be eligible for funding from NIH and non-NIH sources outside of the BAA.  Procedures for establishing collaboration can be found on www.whiscience.org. 

NHLBI anticipates awarding between 14 and 16 2-year contracts in mid January 2009. Awards will be made based on the weighted evaluation factors of technical merit, programmatic balance, and funds availability. It is anticipated that the individual award amounts will vary depending on the scope and capacity of the technical objectives for the award. For example, lower award costs may be made for more focused or limited investigations, and higher award costs may be for consortia proposing more comprehensive investigations. At the sole discretion of the NHLBI, meritorious proposal that cannot be funded within the amount currently available under this BAA may be forwarded to other National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutes for their consideration.

Cost reimbursement type contracts are planned for this acquisition because the programs being solicited will be basic research into highly technical areas of medical/scientific interest where there has been little work performed in the past.  It is expected that only minimal information concerning the specific requirements of the work will be provided by the government in the BAA.  It will be necessary for the contractors to develop their own research programs including research hypotheses and methods based on highly specialized knowledge and expertise.  The contractors will need to have considerable medical/scientific expertise in order to carry out the work to achieve the highly sophisticated research and technical objectives of the programs. 

EVALUATION PLAN

The primary basis for selecting proposals submitted in response to this BAA shall be technical excellence, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  The technical evaluation of proposals will be conducted through a peer review process in accordance with established criteria. The evaluation criteria shall evaluate the Offeror?s scientific and technical approach, adequacy of the technical approach, the Offerors? capabilities, and the qualifications, capabilities experience, and availability of proposed key personnel. NHLBI program and administrative staff will determine importance to agency programs and availability of funds.  In addition, past performance of the Offeror and the extent of small disadvantaged business concerns in performance of the program will also be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.304.

This sources sought announcement is published to notify the contracting community of this upcoming project and is meant to inform of its breadth and scope. This is NOT a request for proposals. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541710 e.g. Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. If your institution is a small business and would like to submit a capabilities statement to inform this office of how your business may fulfill some portion of this requirement, you are welcome to send two (2) copies thereof to this Office. Do not include budget information.

<SUBJECT>61 -- Energy Management Control System
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE-SOURCE.  The USAF Academy intends to award a sole-source Energy Management Control System (EMCS) contract to Siemens? Building Technology, Inc.  
The Academy?s EMCS is standardized with Siemens Building Technology System?s licensed software and hardware components, which are not compatible with any other brand or EMCS system.  The particular use of Siemens for connection to the EMCS is vital to ensure compatibility with the existing and expanding system.  

The Government has an operating license for the Siemens-owned software.  Proprietary information as it relates to this acquisition includes software programs and applications developed and sold by Siemens.  All DDC controllers are proprietary (as per patent protection) and this includes the operation source code in each controller.  
The existing system, which has been in place since 1978, has over 150,000 points and is one of the largest, most complex EMCS systems within the DOD.  Therefore, it has been determined that this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued development of a major system.  
The Sole Source requirement is necessary to maintain continuity of service and to continue to improve the overall system.  

This requirement will be referenced with solicitation no.: FA7000-07-R-0043.  The Standard Industrial Code (SIC) is 3822, the business size is 500 employees, and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334512.  

This requirement is determined to be available from only one source because of its unique requirements.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  

Point of contact is Michella Hill, 10 MSG/LGCB, 8110 Industrial Dr. USAF Academy, CO 80840-2315, (719) 333-2789, Michella.Hill@usafa.af.mil.

Please send all written comments and questions to the following by July 24, 2008.  If further information is required, please do not hesitate to call me at (208) 397-5695.

		Email:  chightower@fs.fed.us

The Contractor will define, establish, document, and implement a Continued Airworthiness Program (CAP) to predict and prevent fatigue separations.  

The CAP must: contain: 

?	Define and describe the contractor?s airworthiness program and how it meets the exhibit requirements.

?	Insure that the aircraft has been issued a Standard or Restricted certificate by the FAA.

?	Meet the intent of developing a maintenance and inspection program specific to their airtanker fleet.

?	Submit documents for FAA approved Instructions for Continued Airworthiness in accordance with FAR 25.1529 at Amendment Level 54 or later, and be based on the FAA Type certification. 

Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) are maintenance actions defined by the TC or STC holder in accordance with 14 CFR 25.1529 and delivered with the airplane or provided by the manufacturer in accordance with ? 21.509. ICA?s are documented information that includes applicable methods, inspections, processes, procedures and airworthiness limitations.


?	Obtain documentation of manufacturer support for maintenance of the aircraft while the vendor is operating their aircraft in the firefighting role. 

?	Include an evaluation of the airtanker structure (airframe and tank) to FAR 25.571 at Amendment Level 96 or later.  

Amendment 96 of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 25.571 requires that it ?be demonstrated with sufficient full-scale test evidence that WFD will not occur within the design service goal of the airplane.? It requires special consideration for WFD and requires full scale fatigue testing have been completed on a same model airframe.  The corresponding Advisory Circular (AC) 25.571-1C provides general guidelines on the requirements and recommends rigorous posttest teardown inspections as a way to generate sufficient evidence. However, AC 25.571-1C does not specify the teardown protocol, inspection procedures, data collection, and subsequent analyses. Comprehensive guidelines and data that are documented and available to the broader aviation community are lacking. It would require that an LOV (or DSG) be established for the airframe.  


?	Install and monitor an aircraft Operational Load Monitoring (OLM) system for the purpose of updating and improving the continued airworthiness of the Contractor?s aircraft.  

?	Provide for the Contractor to submit revised ICA?s to the FAA for approval based on the operation of the aircraft as an airtanker using the data collected from the OLM system.  The revised ICA would be based on either an analysis similar to that used in FAA certification or a combination of analysis used for FAA certification and data obtained from firefighting operations.  As a minimum, revised ICA?s would be submitted prior to the 3rd year of the contract.  Copies of the package submitted to the FAA will be sent to the Contracting Officer.

?	Explain how a quality assurance program will be put in place to insure that the Contractor can predict and prevent fatigue separations.

Section 2.0 Statement of Work 2.1	Contract Objectives: 	To provide RMA with the necessary information to determine if the Silage Sorghum Pilot Insurance Program should be modified and continued as a pilot, terminated, or converted to a permanent program 2.2	Scope and Type of Work This contract will involve submitting reports and oral presentations on the results of a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the Silage Sorghum Pilot Endorsement.   In general, the work will involve critical thinking and innovative problem solving techniques; compiling and analyzing results of research; data collection and review, and data analysis; categorizing, analyzing, and summarizing verbal information; report writing, and presenting the findings orally; and project planning, scheduling and quality control.  More specifically, the program evaluations will involve evaluating the applicable insurance program materials; obtaining grower and insurance provider feedback; tendering reports that document the contractor's evaluation of the program and its recommendations, and delivering oral presentations to RMA and the FCIC Board of Directors. 2.3	Background The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) Board of Directors authorized the implementation of the Silage Sorghum Pilot Endorsement starting with the 2005 crop year to run through the 2008 crop year.  The pilot program was authorized to run in two counties in Colorado (Baca, Prowers) and 37 counties in Kansas (Barton, Decatur, Ellis, Finney, Ford, Gove, Graham, Grant, Gray, Greeley, Hamilton, Haskell, Hodgeman, Kearny, Lane, Logan, Meade, Morton, Ness, Norton, Osborne, Phillips, Rawlins, Rooks, Rush, Russell, Scott, Seward, Sheridan, Sherman, Smith, Stanton, Stevens, Thomas, Trego, Wallace, Wichita).  The number of policies earning premium increased during the pilot program, from 250 in crop year 2005 to 1,046 in crop year 2006.  Insured acres have also increased from 26,826 acres in crop year 2005 to 216,631acres in 2006. The loss experience of the Silage Sorghum Pilot Endorsement has been unfavorable.  The loss ratio was 2.41 in 2005 and 3.02 in 2006 For the 2007 Crop Year RMA made actuarial and underwriting changes to the program to address issues.  One of these issues has been the lack of information concerning silage only varieties or if they exists.  T-yields for non-irrigated silage sorghum were reduced to reflect returns on comparable crops.  Producers were required to provide documentation they produced and sold or fed silage sorghum two of the last four crop years, Insurable acreage was capped at 125 percent of the last two years average of insurable harvested acreage. RMA developed a Program Evaluation Handbook, FCIC-22010 (SOW Attachment 1) to provide a framework for comprehensive assessments of insurance programs operated by FCIC, both permanent (regulatory) and pilot.  A program evaluation is performed to ensure that relevant provisions of the Act are met as effectively and efficiently as possible while providing risk management tools that meet the needs of agricultural producers.  Program evaluations examine the past and present performance of a crop program to determine if that performance can be improved and if there are program vulnerabilities and weaknesses.  The outcome of a program evaluation may result in recommendations to revise any regulation, manual, handbook, guide, directive, or actuarial structure to address any identified conflicts, ambiguities, inconsistencies, gaps, duplications, or other problems.  A sound program is a program with documents that are clear, consistent, in accordance with the applicable law and regulations, understandable, predictable, and enforceable; that reduce the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse; and, that reduce risk of litigation. Specifically, a program evaluation determines if: 1.	There are problem areas or issues with the plan of insurance and to identify discrepancies between the policy provisions, procedures, and current practices and technology in the industry; 2.	There are policy vulne

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  This announcement serves as both a notice to offerors and as the solicitation.  Responses (Quotes) should be developed based upon this announcement since a formal solicitation (Request for Quotations) will not be issued.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  The NAICS Code is 541511.  It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Knova Software Inc., One North Shore Center, 12 Federal Street, Suite 503, Pittsburgh, PA 15212 for the purpose of upgrading, installing and deploying KNOVA 7.2 proprietary software.  KNOVA 7.2 includes the following suite of Intelligent Customer Experience applications:  KNOVA Contact Center?, KNOVA Self-Service?, KNOVA Forums?, KNOVA Field Service?, KNOVA Guided Selling?, and KNOVA Knowledge Desk?.  KNOVA brand name software and maintenance support were previously selected in 2004 for the initial design and installation to support the NIH Help Desk.  KNOVA has provided infrastructure maintenance support to the NIH Help Desk since that date.  KNOVA is currently integrated into the NIH Help Desk?s Remedy problem-tracking system and is used directly by the NIH Help Desk staff and other NIH technical support infrastructure components.  The upgrade, installation and deployment of KNOVA 7.2 will enable the NIH Help Desk to complete its transition to a service desk utilizing ITIL to assimilate the other components required to complete the service desk model.  In addition to enhanced functionality, an upgrade to KNOVA 7.2 will provide a Return on Investment (ROI).  KNOVA 7.2 software represents a major upgrade from the existing KNOVA Version 5.0 and will include the following enhancements:  Successful deployment of KNOVA 7.2 live in the NIH environment, including installation; KNOVA Contact Center for Internal Users; and Configuration of Authoring Workflow and Document, Template and External Content Integration.  KNOVA 7.2 is a top-rated product suite delivered on a powerful, adaptive NLP Search and Knowledge Management Platform.  KNOVA 7.2 provides an intuitive toolset that will allow the NIH Help Desk to affect the customer experience in a far more granular manner.  KNOVA 7.2 features a patented self-learning search technology that enables users to access the best answers quickly.  Service desk agents simply enter questions or issues in the customer's own words (supporting the Federal Government?s Plain Language Initiative), and KNOVA Knowledge Desk informs them of the resolution options with the highest probability of success.  Critically, this patented self-learning search and Knowledge Management engine - called the Cognitive Processor? - continuously learns and improves with each transaction.  KNOVA 7.2 provides a more proactive approach to managing the customer help desk experience than the traditional focus on service resolution management.  The features included in KNOVA 7.2 will also support collaboration across NIH Institutes/Centers.  Since KNOVA engineered the existing software used by the NIH Help Desk, it would be difficult at best for another commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product to map to the existing data.  Furthermore, the KNOVA 7.2 user interface supports Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. ? 794d). CIT has determined that the upgrade (including installation and deployment) of KNOVA 7.2 brand name software is the only COTS product that can provide the enhanced software functions required by the NIH Help Desk.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their capabilities which will be considered by the agency.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a software product, and installation and deployment, that can fulfill all of the enhancements described above.  Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award.  Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at:  http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.

To date, the Department maintains over 220 million dollars worth of radio communications equipment worldwide. To maintain this equipment, a procurement vehicle has been in place to cover the need to purchase parts and life cycle replacement radios.     	This procurement vehicle, an IDIQ contract SLMAQM 01 D 0013 with Motorola Corporation has exercised its last option year, and a new refresh contract is in negotiations between Motorola and Department of State. The life cycle for the deployed radio system has four more years in which operations and maintenance are required to continue. 	The justification for sole sourcing with Motorola Corporation is due to the Motorola proprietary embedded signal algorithms essential to the compatibility of the network.  In addition, the Federal Flash algorithm which allow the federal government to deploy the zoned radios globally. Without it a radio can not access these networks and communicate emergency instructions.  This is the MDC1200 signaling algorithm. 	The Radio Programs Branch relies on Motorola equipment to meet the requirements of the O&M phase now in existence.<BR><BR>

To date, the Department maintains over 220 million dollars worth of radio communications equipment worldwide. To maintain this equipment, a procurement vehicle has been in place to cover the need to purchase parts and life cycle replacement radios.     	This procurement vehicle, an IDIQ contract SLMAQM 01 D 0013 with Motorola Corporation has exercised its last option year, and a new refresh contract is in negotiations between Motorola and Department of State. The life cycle for the deployed radio system has four more years in which operations and maintenance are required to continue. 	The justification for sole sourcing with Motorola Corporation is due to the Motorola proprietary embedded signal algorithms essential to the compatibility of the network.  In addition, the Federal Flash algorithm which allow the federal government to deploy the zoned radios globally. Without it a radio can not access these networks and communicate emergency instructions.  This is the MDC1200 signaling algorithm. 	The Radio Programs Branch relies on Motorola equipment to meet the requirements of the O&M phase now in existence.<BR><BR>

    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-07-R-66RA90 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 336611.  The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.

This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Quantity of 1 Job: Assessment of the Dynamic Behavior of a High-Speed Foil Thrust Bearing Test Rig (Oil-Free Turbomachinery) Overview The High-Speed Thrust Bearing Test Rig at NASA Glenn Research Center is capable of testing oil-free thrust bearings up to 80,000rpm and 540°C (1000°F).  This turbine-driven rig consists of a rotating shaft supported radially by foil journal bearings and axially by an active magnetic bearing, with a thrust runner bolted to the shaft.  Foil thrust bearings are mounted on a nonrotating shaft and loaded axially against the rotating runner, while measuring reactionary torque of the test bearing.  A more detailed description of this test rig may be found in the sources listed at the end of this document.   As delivered, the test rig was equipped with a hydrostatically supported piston system to load the test bearing, allowing for high-temperature operation.  However, axial vibratory modes at certain operating conditions restrict the usefulness of this arrangement, and subsequently an arrangement with mechanical loading and support has been substituted, with only room-temperature test capability.  As part of a facility upgrade plan, NASA intends to award a contract to assess the dynamic behavior inherent to this test rig and recommend potential solutions.  Contract Requirements The requested work entails both onsite and offsite activities to assess the axial dynamic behavior of the rig rotor system.  First, the contractor shall travel to NASA GRC to collect dynamic data from the test rig during operation over the course of 2 consecutive business days.	The contractor shall provide a standalone data acquisition system and any sensors and instrumentation required to measure vibrations, axial displacement, and any other qualities the contractor deems necessary.  Additional instrumentation on the test rig may be used by the contractor to further provide data, and the Government may make available additional sensors and equipment at its discretion.  The contractor shall record simultaneous measurements of the axial position of the rotating shaft and of the test bearing load piston.  The frequency and phase response of the magnetic bearing controller shall be measured and reviewed to be incorporated into the system dynamic model.  NASA will provide and install a test thrust bearing, and NASA-designated personnel will be responsible for safe operation of the rest rig during this data collection phase.  Following the onsite collection of dynamic data, the contractor shall create a model for dynamic analysis to predict system behavior. This model will be compared to the collected test data in order to determine axial resonances and mode shapes.  The control algorithm for the magnetic bearing shall be examined for appropriateness and alternate implementations investigated if warranted.  Derating the magnetic bearing load capacity to achieve better dynamic response at low loads will be considered. The contractor shall submit a final report documenting their detailed findings and conclusions.  Magnetic bearing controller bode plots are to be provided along with details of the control algorithm, as well as approximate transfer functions for both control and plant.  Details of the magnetic bearing including current and loads in appropriate units shall be provided in the report.  Axial resonance modes shall be documented along with parameterized expressions governing the behavior.  The contractor shall recommend one or more possible solutions to improve system dynamic behavior, including updated control hardware and changes to the control algorithm, if required.  The contractor shall deliver this final report within one month of completing the onsite work.

Deliverables:
A written MDR program addressing the inspection and investigation of medical device complaints including the preparation of reports and exhibits.

The activities encompassed within this procurement are intended to ensure effective and consistent administration of the Border Enforcement Grant program and other FMCSA grant programs including the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) and the Commercial Driver??s License Program (CDL)

When operating in the United States, Mexican and Canadian carriers, drivers, and vehicles are required to comply with all Federal and State safety and operating regulations. These regulations include operating authority, insurance, and other requirements of the FMCSA. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance.  To effectively meet its responsibilities, the FMCSA has been working in concert with the States to improve commercial motor vehicle safety and ensure foreign carriers, drivers, and vehicles that enter and operate in the United States comply with U.S. commercial motor vehicle, driver and carrier safety requirements.

	The North America Borders Division within FMCSA is responsible for administering grants being made available to Border States to expand and sustain commercial vehicle inspection and other compliance activities in preparation for full implementation of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) truck access provisions.  The State Programs Division administers the MCSAP and the Commercial Drivers License Division administers the CDL.

The authority to award a contract and obligate funds for this requirement is contained in the Motor Carrier Safety Reauthorization Act of 2005 (H.R. 4818, PL 108-447).

Paragraph 31313(b) High Priority Activities specifies that ??The Secretary may make a grant to a State agency, local government, or other person for 100 percent of the costs of research, development, demonstration projects, public education, and other special activities and projects relating to commercial driver licensing and motor vehicle safety that are of benefit to all jurisdictions of the United States or are designed to address national safety concerns and circumstances.??  

Authorization to use MCSAP Administrative Takedown funds for this purpose is contained in 49 U.S.C. 31104(e) Deduction for Administrative Expenses, which provides that the Secretary may deduct, from the funds made available each fiscal year, not more than 1.25 percent of those amounts for expenses incurred in the administration of MCSAP.

Database monitoring
Database monitoring can detect problems before they become critical, identify performance bottlenecks and warn about possible inconsistencies in the database, system or software. 

Problem determination and resolution
Databases may fail or experience errors due to a number of reasons, including power fluctuations, system crash, hardware failures, bug in a software or a user error. Problem determination and resolution, thus, requires the person to be the expert in a number of fields, including system administration and engineering, database administration and LIS software. 
Critical performance problems ("deadlocks", "lock ups", or "very slow system" events) can often be resolved "on the fly" to minimize client's downtime and adverse effects of slowdown.

Database backup, recovery and failover.
It is essential that patient data is protected and recoverable should the disaster strike. Engineers will create and set up backup configuration, adjusted to our hardware architecture and requirements. 
Database backups monitoring and verification is a cooperative effort between engineers and the client, DCRI will check their database backup daily and report any failures to engineers  to make sure database is continuously recoverable.
Although backups are normally performed as automatic or semi-automatic jobs, recovery is a complex process, which requires significant knowledge of database engine and is usually a manual process, performed by domain expert.
For dual systems configurations, database operations can be fail overed to the auxiliary system, if the primary system fails.
Database administrators are trained and certified in database backup and recovery and database failover.
Database performance tuning

Performance of applications depends to a large degree on a performance of the database. Properly configured and tuned database can increase database through output and reduce average wait times several times, compared to an untuned one on the same hardware. Engineers will collect and analyze database performance statistics over representative time period and perform necessary adjustments to database(s), based on the current workload, underlying system configuration and business needs. 
Conduct periodic workload analysis and adjustments are necessary to make sure database is running on peak efficiency.


Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Government Furnished Information:

The government will provide the contractor with the necessary facilities to support task completion, including desktop computers, software and network services.

<SOLNBR>SECHQ1-07-R-0173

<CONTACT>Linda Baier, Contracting Officer, Phone 202 551 7315, Fax 703 914 9226, Email baierl@sec.gov
<DESC>Q&A for SECHQ1-07-R-0173 for IV&V Services

The following questions have been received; the answers follow each question.  The questions are divided into two groups:  technical and administrative.  Technical questions refer to requirements of Section C and administrative questions refer to preparation of the proposals.

TECHNICAL:
1.	Will the work be performed at the SEC site or Contractor site?
The work will be performed at the SEC site.
2.	Is there any work required outside of DC metro area other than occasional travel to other SEC location?
There is no work required outside of the DC metro area.
3.	Can the contractor(s) utilize any testing tools that they feel will accomplish the IV&V task(s)?
The contractor may bid testing tools as part of their technical solution.  Contractors should identify which tools they would use as part of their solution as well.
4.	What automated testing tools will SEC desire for IV&V contractor to use for this work?
The SEC has not defined any tools for the contractor to use for this work.  Tools that the contractor would use to perform this work should be identified in the proposal.
5.	What is the technical environment of the EDGAR and also other OIT applications? 
EDGAR and the SEC use both the Windows and Unix (Sun and J2EE) environments for software development and deployment.
6.	Can you please provide list of other OIT applications, their function, and technical environment that would require IV&V service under CLIN 0002?
Attachment 3 of the solicitation lists other OIT applications and a brief description of their function.  The technical environments that would require IV&V service would be both the Windows and Unix (Sun and J2EE) environments.
7.	What configuration control system is used for the software source code?
The SEC uses PVCS.
8.	How many releases of the EDGAR application are implemented each year?
 Approximately four releases each year.
9.	Who is incumbent development contractor for EDGAR application and the incumbent development contractor for other OIT applications that require IV&V?
There are several contractors here at the Commission who provide development services for OIT but there is not an incumbent providing all of the services.  We do not consider that we have an incumbent.
10.	The profile of the personnel required by the SEC involves a skill set that is rare which may not easily and readily available. Will the SEC give reasonable time to the contractor to fill this requirement in case, either a person declines an offer he or she once mentioned they would accept or leaves employment in the middle.  
The answer to this question hinges on the term reasonable.  What may be reasonable for the Commission may not be reasonable for the Contractor.  The SEC will allow reasonable time for the contractor to fill any position when the person in that position leaves abruptly.  For general purposes, assume 60 days or fewer is reasonable.
11.	Page 22, Project Manager description, our lead person was certified under a program at IBM with a minimum base of PMI standards. This involved testing and inspection of the PMI areas by a qualified board and additional evaluation in expanded and related areas to PMI. She then served in two global positions: one to lead certified PMI project executives and another to build IBM?s internal project management capabilities throughout the corporation. Would she still be considered qualified for the PM role at SEC?  
There is nothing in the above description that would disqualify her; however, the strength of her qualifications would depend on her length of experience in the positions and the similarity of the work with what is required for this contract.
ADMINISTRATIVE:
1.	Should we submit the complete proposal via email so that it will be available to you in softcopy MS Office format as required?
Yes.
2.	Is it acceptable if we send the proposal via e-mail only (i.e. electronic copy only, no hard copy)? 
Yes.
3.	Section L.5 Technical Proposal mentions "Offeror?s invited to give an oral presentation of its technical approach will be given no less than five (5) business days to prepare.  The proposed IV&V Team will give the oral presentation."  Since we do not currently possess the personnel with the skills as required in the statement of work, we need to hire them once we get the contract. Since the technical proposal is due before contract award, will it be acceptable to the SEC to have an officer of the contractor deliver such an oral presentation?  
No.  The purpose of having the team present is to assess their skill level and ability to communicate.
4.	Is there any requirement for the personnel to be a US Citizen or a legal permanent resident or isn't there? 
Citizenship is not a requirement but the time to secure a clearance is lengthy and the SEC prefers proposed contractor staff be US citizens.
5.	Is there any requirement for any of the officers of the contracting company to hold any kind of security clearance?  
No.
6.	Several of my contractors hold security clearances, can the SEC hold the clearance as apart of the contract?
No; clearances are not transferable.
7.	What are the criteria for evaluating the criminal and credit history records? For example, would an Experian credit score of < 500 make the personnel ineligible to work at the SEC for this project? Similar question in terms of criminal history. 
 	The SEC does not use the credit score.  Any criminal action or derogatory information is unacceptable.  Mitigating factors may help to negate any issues but it depends on the mitigating factor.  The SEC has very stringent requirements that many contractors and potential employees are not able to meet.
8.	Is there any restriction on the type of subcontracting deal that occurs between the contracting company and the personnel? For example, corp to corp, 1099 contractor or W2?
 	Not to our knowledge. 	
9.	Does the contractor have the option of using any contract vehicle (GSA, etc.)?  If not, what should the labor rates be based against?  
Yes, any contract vehicle may be used.  If none is used, state the basis for the labor rates cited.
10.	Page 13 H.8.1: If form 85P is on file, will another be needed?
 	No. 
11.	Will there be an extension on the due date?  
No.
12.	Would this be single-award IDIQ contract?  
Yes.
13.	Is there page limit on submission due on 8/28 (i.e Addendum A for Experience Matrix and IV&V Team Qualification)?  
No.  
14.	Are you looking to see resumes of key personnel in the IV&V Team Qualification section?  
No.  If so, for what positions?  See Section L.5, Factor 2.  
15.	Would you be providing more instructions on what would be required in orals presentation upon down-selection to the vendors?  
Not regarding content.
16.	The Offeror shall use its own format to describe the experience of each team member, however the page limit is four (4) pages using a 11-pt font or greater.  Responses to the Matrix and the written documentation of work experience are separate submissions.  Can you clarify what you mean by separate submissions?  
Submittal (1) is to fill in the Matrix required at Section L.5, Factor 1.
Submittal (2) is to answer Section L.5, Factor 2.
17.	Page 25 Step one. Is the experience page limit of four (4) page a total for all staff proposed or for each staff member?  
Each person.
18.	It is understood that 4 pages of Personnel Qualification are allowed during the Aug 28th submittal, can we attach the resumes of key personnel in addition to the 4 page description of personnel qualifications? 
No.
19.	Please clarify that in the matrix, you require information about each of the three key personnel in each row?
Yes.
20.	Do you plan on awarding one task order per CLIN number?
No.  CLIN 0002 will definitely have more than one task order.
21.	When do you expect to award the Task Order(s) for CLINS 0001, 0002 and 0003 for base period?  What would be expected start dates of Task Order(s) for CLINS 0001, 0002 and 0003 for base period?  
First task order may be awarded within 30 days after contract award.  Possible start dates would be within 30 days after contract award.
22.	When would you be notifying vendors of down-selection decision and also oral presentation schedule?  
After the evaluation decisions are made, prior to the end of this month.
23.	In Task Order Pricing Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, do you just want us to take into account CLIN 0001 and not other CLINs?  
Yes.  Please read Section L.6.1.b).
24.	ABC is on our small business team; are there any OCI issues associated with ABC participating on the RFP?  
You will need to decide that.
25.	As a young small business, we have not obtained a GSA schedule yet.  If you decide to go with GSA schedule holders, and our team is, still in the competitive range could we use the GSA schedule of one of our teaming partners?
Yes, if the GSA contract is current and covers this type of work.
26.	We are a small business that just formed, how is that viewed by the SEC? 
Past performance will not be counted against you but you must meet all of the other requirements of the solicitation. 
27.	Should we exclude Past Performance submission from the proposal package to be sent on August 28 and bring it at the orals on September 6~10 in both hardcopy format and a softcopy?
Yes.  Please read Section L.3.
28.	 Does exclusion of Past Performance from the 1st package prevent us from getting to orals somehow?
No.
