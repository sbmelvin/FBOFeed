<DESC>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation. NHANES is overseen by the Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (DHNES).
<p>The NHANES program began in the early 1960's and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized United Stated population of about 5,000 persons of all ages each year. These persons are located in 15 randomly selected counties each year. Data from the examination portion of NHANES are used to obtain objective health measures. The NHANES program also assesses new methods for collecting biomedical data in the household and in the mobile examination center (MEC). New methods ensure that NHANES continues to establish national standards in health measures data collection.</p>
<p>NCHS is planning the next National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with interview and health measurement data collection beginning in December 2014. Accordingly, NCHS seeks to procure the following services: 1) statistical services related to the sample design, weighting, and related survey statistical issues; 2) data collection services related to the collection of interview and medical exam data in 15 primary sampling units (PSUs) each year; 3) physical operations services related to the operation of a household interview and medical exam survey conducted in Mobile Examination Centers (MECs) in 15 primary sampling units (PSUs) each year; and 4) information technology services related to the entry, transmission, storage, and delivery of data collected in a home and medical exam survey conducted in 15 primary sampling units (PSUs) per year and any supporting programming and other computer requirements therein. Additionally, NHANES may seek additional services for related medical data collection survey efforts such as community HANES, longitudinal HANES, feasibility studies, pilot tests, methodology studies, genetics, linkage studies, etc.</p>
