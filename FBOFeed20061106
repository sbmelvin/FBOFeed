<DESC>DESCRIPTION: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. This is a Request for Information (RFI) for the Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright-Patterson  AFB, OH. This Request for Information does not constitute a Request for  Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quote (RFQ), nor does this issuance restrict  the Government’s acquisition approach. Wright-Patterson AFB is requesting  information on a name brand or equal high-performance, space-saving  battery, C&D Technologies XT4LC-13, for use in the Major Shared Resource  Center (MSRC).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)  code is 423430.  The contractor shall be required to furnish all  equipment, labor, supplies, and supervision, and perform all operations  necessary for the packaging, transporting, shipping, delivery and  installation of the XT4LC-13 batteries, and removal/disposal of old  batteries from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). The purpose of  this RFI is to identify potential items equal to the B&D Technologies  XT4LC-13 which meet the requirements and specifications cited above and  below in Attachment 1. The government anticipates an Indefinite  Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract, consisting of one base year, plus  four (4) option periods. Delivery of batteries is one (1) to two (2) weeks  after placement of order. Specifications for the XT4LC-13 can be found  below at Attachment 1. Your response should demonstrate capabilities,  expertise, and compatibility and comparability to the C&D Technologies  XT4LC-13. Your response should not exceed 6 pages and should include the  following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone Number;  E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Size of Business. Please  submit your responses to ASC/PKWIS, Building 16, Room 128, 2275 D Street,  Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7228 or via e-mail:  denise.smith2@wpafb.af.mil. Packages should be submitted no later than  3:00 p.m. EDT, November 13, 2006. No facsimile responses will be accepted.  The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this  RFI nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with  preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The Request for  Proposals (RFP) or Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued electronically.  It will be posted on the Wright-Patterson AFB Pre-Award Information  Exchange System (PIXS) web site at: http://www/pixs/wpafb.af.mil/. NO HARD  COPIES WILL BE ISSUED FOR ANY REASON. The RFP/RFQ will be issued  approximately 17 Nov 2006. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to  review this site for updates to the documents. The Department of Defense  (DoD) has determined the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be the  Single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are  interested in conducting business with the Department. Defense procurement  and finance policies require contractors to be registered by 31 May 1998  for consideration in future solicitations, awards, and payment. DoD  contracting officers worldwide will use CCR to identify sources and  financial officers will use it to make payments. To register in CCR, you  may use one of the following methods: (a) call telephone number  1-888-CCR-2423 for further information.

The RFP will be issued on or about 11/20/2006.  Proposals shall be received on or about 12/20/2006.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that is considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors are:    (1) Experience of the Firm (2) Past Performance of the Firm (3) Qualifications of Key Personnel and (4) Management and Technical Approach.  The technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration (GSA) through the Government Point of Entry (GPE) on FedBizOpps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic Government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your company CCR Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your company CCR point of contact), your company DUNS Number or CAGE code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No Federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address:  www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink. It is the vendor?s responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for any changes and/or conditions.  Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to use the Online Representation and Certification Application (ORCA).  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information at your convenience via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items:  an active CCR record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Once in ORCA, you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer the questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provided are then automatically entered in the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provision for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

17. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Delivery Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the area of V-22 maintenance data ground stations.  This effort requires intricate knowledge of the diagnostic ground station used by the V-22 platform which is poised for two key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 anticipated in June 2007 and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22 anticipated in October of 2007.  RTSC is the only known source independent of the V-22 prime contractor that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints to the program.

V-22 Aircraft Maintenance Event Ground Station (AMEGS).  AMEGS is a ground station system that collects maintenance, vibration, failure, and engine data from the aircraft and uses that data to generate diagnostic information that can be utilized for aircraft data analysis, trending, and troubleshooting. RTSC designed, developed, tested and produced the AMEGS, and continues to implement new functionality.  RTSC will also continue to support and sustain the current AMEGS product to include interfaces with the Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS) and the Air Force Integrated Maintenance Database System-Central Database (IMDS-CDB). RTSC will also continue to support the transition of further automating the maintenance data ground station toolset.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The period of performance is to start 02 January 2007 through 31 December 2007.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 02 January 2007.  Services under current contract number N00421-02-D-3073 with Raytheon Technical Services Corporation expire 31 December 2006.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.*****

The lead firm(s) selected for contract award will be engineering design firm(s) as the majority of services to be performed under this contract(s) will generally be civil/environmental engineering in nature. The contract type will be firm fixed-priced. The Government may elect to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts to one or more sources under this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work. Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued. The Government will use such factors as experience, qualifications, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, geographic location, and other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders. With respect to the production of plans and specifications (Title II design services), the maximum amount that can be paid to an Architect-Engineer (A/E) is 6% of the estimated cost of construction (41 U.S.C. § 254(b)). In accordance with Department of Interior Acquisition Policy Release (DIAPR) 2004-1, Amendment 1 and its Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (SBCDP) Adjustment of Set-Aside Policy, the NPS has reinstated the use of small business set-asides for A-E Services NAICS Code 541330 - Engineering Services. Accordingly, this acquisition is set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS Code is 541330. The Small Business Size Standard is $4.5 million. For the purposes of this acquisition, any concern will be classified as small business if its average annual gross revenue for the preceding three fiscal years does not exceed the small business size standard stated herein. 1. TYPES OF PROJECTS - Projects may include, but are not limited to: A.  Buildings and Structures. B.  Drainage and Stormwater Management Systems. C.  Electrical Systems. D.

C.  Incidental services, e.g., AutoCAD drafting and 3D modeling, GIS, Microsoft Word processing, Adobe Acrobat, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements. D.  Professional registration of Architect-Engineer staff. Active professional registration of Architect-Engineer staff will be required in accordance with FAR 52.236-25. It will not be necessary for prospective firms to hold registrations within all the States, Commonwealths, or Territory that comprise the entire National Park Service, Pacific West Region (California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Guam, Saipan, and American Samoa) at the time of submission of the SF-330, but the ability and willingness to obtain registration(s) where it may be needed will be considered in evaluating qualifications. 3. CONTRACT PERIOD - All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract. The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. The total duration of the contract, including options, shall not exceed 5 years. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed-price or not-to-exceed type task orders. The maximum ordering limitation will be $7,500,000.00 for the life of the contract. Each task order will not exceed $250,000.00. The $7,500,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread over the life of the contract including all option years. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $50,000.00. 4. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN - The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. 5. EXECUTIVE ORDER - In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures. Work performed under this contract may be subject to this requirement. 6. PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED - For the purposes of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily: A.  Project Planning and Compliance Services;  B.  Predesign Services: 1.  Programming; 2.  Site Analysis; 3.  Supplementary Services; C.  Design Services: 1.  Schematic Design; 2.  Value Analysis; 3.  Design Development;	4.  Construction Documents; 5.  Construction Support; and D.  Construction Management Services. 7. COORDINATION - The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving  projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes, and policies. 8. SPECIALIZED SERVICES - In the course of doing business with A/E firms under contract with the NPS, our office occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the sub consultant, the NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor. Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass throughs" would have on the cap. This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s). Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services. The NPS does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub consultant's services. 9. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA - Statements of Qualifications will be evaluated by a selection committee of NPS personnel based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: A.	Engineering & Design:  Demonstrated professional qualifications, technical expertise, and experience in developing integrated designs, specifications, and cost estimates for projects in a multidisciplinary environment.

The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $50,000.00. 4. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN - The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. 5. EXECUTIVE ORDER - In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures. Work performed under this contract may be subject to this requirement. 6. PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED - For the purposes of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily: A.  Project Planning and Compliance Services;  B.  Predesign Services: 1.  Programming; 2.  Site Analysis; 3.  Supplementary Services; C.  Design Services: 1.  Schematic Design; 2.  Value Analysis; 3.  Design Development;	4.  Construction Documents; 5.  Construction Support; and D.  Construction Management Services. 7. COORDINATION - The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving  projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes, and policies. 8. SPECIALIZED SERVICES - In the course of doing business with A/E firms under contract with the NPS, our office occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the sub consultant, the NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor. Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass throughs" would have on the cap. This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s). Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services. The NPS does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub consultant's services. 9. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA - Statements of Qualifications will be evaluated by a selection committee of NPS personnel based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: A.	Engineering & Design:  Demonstrated professional qualifications, technical expertise, and experience in developing integrated designs, specifications, and cost estimates for projects in a multidisciplinary environment.  Emphasis will be on experience in sustainable designs that minimize the use of non-renewable resources through water and energy conservations; that use alternative energy sources, recycled content materials and recovered materials; that promote low life cycle costs, pollution prevention and waste reduction; and that possess good constructability and ease of operation and maintenance.  Demonstrated qualifications of key project staff responsible for integrated design including professional accreditation, registration, licensure, certifications and training.   B.	Project Management and Construction Administration:  Demonstrated project management and contract administration experience and expertise with integrated design with an emphasis in coordinating a multidisciplinary team of internal and external resources.  Demonstrated ability of the firm and its sub consultants to successfully communicate, coordinate, facilitate, and work expeditiously with Federal, state, and local agencies, organizations, and individuals.  Demonstrated ability of the firm and its sub consultants to manage and maintain scope of work, budgets, and schedules without sacrificing quality of product or deliverables. C.	Firm Profile:  Demonstrated technical expertise and experience of the firm and its sub consultants with architecture and engineering (A/E) projects in a variety of settings, such as new construction or repair/rehabilitation, urban and remote locations, various climatic regions and environments (including but not limited to: high mountains, volcanic area, tropical, coastal, heavy snow, arid desert, and isolated conditions) with sensitivity to natural, cultural, and historic resources, as well as aesthetic attributes consistent with a National Park. D.	Codes, Standards, Regulations, and Requirements:  Demonstrated knowledge and application of all Federal, state, and local codes, standards, regulations, and requirements pertaining to projects involving but not limited to the following components: water and wastewater, building, structural and seismic, drainage and storm water, electrical, fire protection, geotechnical, marine and coastal areas, mechanical, transportation and traffic, and surveying.  Demonstrated knowledge and application of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), National Historical Preservation Act (NHPA) and other relevant construction permitting and requirements.   E.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541360   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Globe Explorer of Walnut Creek, California.  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide an Internet-based service for high quality and satellite imagery of the United States and border regions.  The EPA's Geospatial Community, consisting of over 300 experts from the 10 regions and 7 major programs use this imagery to conduct a variety of forms of analysis and models.  Globe Explorer is a small business entity that provides the imagery through a web-based  service that charges EPA based on the number of pixels of imagery accessed.  Absent access to Globe Explorer, EPA would have to spend several weeks and considerable manpower converting and loading a terabyte of unprocessed imagery provided to us by the Defense Department.  Globe Explorer is the  only commercial service that provides high quality and comprehensive imagery for the nation and providess this imagery in formats suitable for directly integrating into our ArcESRI tools.  Our market research indicates that there is no other commercial service that provides the full range of  imagery available directly through Globe Explorer.  Finally, Globe Explorer is currently integrated into a number of EPA's applications and redirecting these applications to another viable service would  not be cost effective for the Government.  It is believed that any cost savings which may be  achieved through competition cannot offset the cost of the in-house effort to redirect and rework these applications to another  viable service.  Offerors who can provide an equivalent system to the Globe Explorer which can be proven to be fully compatible with the pre-existing systems can submit a  capability statement to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency c/o Elaine Scott 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue., N.W., Washington, D.C.  20460 U.S. EPA Mail Code 3803R or via email at scott.elaine@epa.gov by 2PM EST Tuesday, November 14, 2006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541611   Provide labor and materials for the support of the implementation of the Industry Partnership Initiative according to the below-noted Statement of Work for a two-year period.  Industry Partnership Initiative - Statement of Work.  Purpose of Project:  Industry Partnership Initiative is a program to promote voluntary partnerships of locally-based business and industry working together with community and regulatory agencies to reduce emissions of air toxic pollutants.   Participating Industry Partners are committed to reducing hazardous air pollutants and decreasing  accidental releases in the communities in which they operate. The Industry Partners include a diverse group of industries ranging from chemical manufacturers, refineries, research laboratories, baking companies and others.  Two partnerships are being established this year - one in the metro  Philadelphia area and a smaller partnership in Claymont, DE.  Additional partnerships may be formed in West Virginia and/or Virginia.  The Industry Partnership is characterized, in part, by focusing on a place.  The Industry Partnership will accomplish emission reduction and accident prevention  goals by fostering communication and in exchanging ideas and technology among the community, industry and government.  Industry Partnerships represent a feasible and measurable approach for reducing emissions and exposures of air toxics in our urban neighborhoods - areas which face the cumulative  effect of multiple pollutants from multiple sources (point, area, mobile). To assist the Industry Partnerships, EPA will offer a range of technical assistance: on-site audits, training workshops, development of environmental management systems, and possibly technology cost-sharing.  EPA is  currently working in two places, Philadelphia and Claymont, DE to identify specific technical assistance and training needs to assist in meeting air toxics reduction goals of these nearly formed Industry Partnerships. This Statement of Work (SOW) describes several activities required by the  contractor to  support the Industry Partners' technical assistance needs, specifically, the Claymont, DE and Philadelphia metropolitan area partnerships.  The government will work with industry partners to identify specific technical assistance needs required by industry partners and will decide  which facilities will receive contractor support as identified in the tasks listed.   The contractor shall work with EPA and Industry Partners to deliver the technical assistance in a timely manner and with appropriate reporting and follow-up actions. The [service provider] will provide the  following services over a two-year period:  1.During the course of the two year period, the contractor shall conduct a maximum of 12 facility site audits as requested  to help determine pollution prevention, control technology and/or other options to reduce emissions of identified priority air  toxic pollutants. Any size of facility will be considered for the technical assistance; however, priority will be given to those industry partners which do not in-house capability.  EPA will determine which facilities would be appropriate to receive contractor support as outlined in this SOW.  a.  One site audit in both Claymont and Philadelphia is guaranteed. b. Follow-up with 5 of the audited facilities to help determine reduction benefits (post-assessments). EPA will work with Industry partners to identify which facilities will engage in follow-up assessments. c. Travel within 25 miles of  Philadelphia and/or Wilmington, DE is included for one contractor at the government per diem rate. 2. The contractor shall compile best practices, relevant for local use (may include language translation), for  area sources which may include one of the following kinds of industry:  metal finishers,  small chemical manufacturing,  a. Use and/or revise existing  materials provided by EPA and/or other partners to serve as technical assistance guidance for facilities/businesses in the Mid-Atlantic region w/emphasis on Philadelphia metro area and Wilmington/Claymont, DE area. 3.  The contractor  shall conduct 1 or 2 workshops in the greater metro Philadelphia area or Claymont, DE area on pollution prevention/toxic emissions reduction strategies for Industry Partners: a. Develop a draft and final agenda that meets the needs of the Industry Partners b. Send invitations; provide venue, and  supporting workshop materials c. Provide follow-up assistance to 1-5 participating facilities upon request by EPA.  These facilities would include small to mid-sized businesses which do not have their own capacity and/or technical expertise to implement reduction activities in the absence of  technical support. d. At conclusion of workshop, compile information and ideas into a 'best practices' document for circulation among partners.  4.  Deliverables:  The contractor shall provide the following deliverables within the timeframes indicated. a. Draft/draft final reports for each facility  site assessments to be delivered to EPA and facility contact person within 30 days of site visit.  b. Draft/draft final reports on selected facilities that participate in post-implementation assessments (within 30 days of site visit)  c.

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 05 should be submitted by 31 Mar 05; FY 06 by 01 Nov 05; FY 07 by 11 Dec 06; and FY 08 by 01 Nov 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.     

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support the development and operation of information management technology in accordance with AFRL Information Management technology goals. 

Information management (IM) is defined as a set of intentional activities to maximize the value of information to support the objectives of the enterprise.  The managed information referred to a Managed Information Object (MIO) which is comprised of a payload (e.g., document, imagery, or movie clip) and metadata that characterizes the object (e.g., topic, time, and location).

Much of the current research in the area of net-centric approaches aimed at addressing the technical challenges presented by System of Systems (SOS) and information interoperability is primarily focused in the area of Business to Business (B2B) exchange of services, information and/or products.  Standards organizations such as the WC3 (www.w3.org) and OASIS (www.oasis-open.org) are engaged in the development of XML-based specifications that define the protocols and information exchange formats that establish the foundation for building business capabilities and their underlying commercial Web Services (WS) infrastructure implementations.   The DoD is basing their Global Information Grid Enterprise Services (GIG-ES) (www.disa.mil) and Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) (www.disa.mil) infrastructure on these emerging standards.   It is expected that NCES will provide the core services that will enable the interoperability of all DoD net-centric operations from business processes to the forward deployed warfighter. 

Concurrently, AFRL/IF has been conducting research in the areas of information dissemination and management approaches which have been focused uniquely on military applications and requirements.   This research has lead to the development of multiple information dissemination and management infrastructures conforming to the Infospherics (www.infospherics.org) Common API.  Both commercial and AFRL/IF research and development initiatives provide useful approaches to systems and information interoperability challenges. The concept of an Infosphere: "a set of managed information (MIOs), services to facilitate information gathering and dissemination, the producers and/or consumers of that information, and the managers of that information," is central to the AFRL Information Management vision.  The Federation of  Infospheress to address a set of mission and information requirements, provides a useful basis for interoperability regardless of underlying technology or implementation. Understanding how these concepts and technologies can be applied in the unique military operational and tactical domains is of critical importance.   Further, identifying and addressing deficiencies in these technologies will be essential to achieving the DoD vision of Net-Centric Operations (NCO).

This solicitation is divided into three (3) technical areas focused on how to construct, share and federate information.  White papers are expected to address a technical area but may address solutions that respond to requirements across the technical areas as well.  All white papers should address solutions based on the development of non-proprietary, modular components (including the delivery of source code) that will be capable of being integrated into existing or emerging IM infrastructures.

Area (1):  Dynamic Node Discovery-Fundamental to supporting a  "from the ground up"  automatic formation of a Infoshere, is the discovery and configuration of the underlying communications and networking nodes.  This technical area is focused on developing methods and approaches to address this requirement, specifically focusing on an airborne network environment.   A set of Internet Protocol based interfaces are required to allow services operating at the application (middleware) layer to discover and interact with each other regardless of the underlying communication waveforms and must support both connection oriented and connectionless services.   A critical aspect of this research will be the specification and implementation of an API that enables observation and control to flow between the network layer and the application (middleware) layer.  The software application (middleware) will use these common interfaces to facilitate the creation and maintenance of dynamically evolving information management infrastructures.  The realization of this new capability will potentially require enhancements and/or modifications to lower layer protocols.  Minimizing the impact of these enhancements and/or modifications on existing standards and systems is crucial.

Successful white papers in this technical area will provide a flexible and standardized interface design consisting of non-proprietary, modular components (including the delivery of source code) capable of being integrated into existing or emerging IM infrastructures.  The technical issues listed below identify specific concerns, but should not be used to limit or constrain innovative ideas:

(a) Methods for node discovery generalized across a variety of communications systems, and differing physical and link layer configurations. 

(b) Methods to deal with reliability issues in the airborne network environment

(c) Methods to handle network disruptions

(d) Methods to address Tactical Data Links, and other non-IP based environments

Area (2):  Infosphere Discovery and Bootstrap-This technical area is focused on the need for rigorous processes and procedures that are necessary to dynamically discover, create, and maintain a shared information space in a dynamically changing airborne tactical environment.  Information management capabilities across this environment will necessarily be decentralized.  Components of the IM infrastructure, as well as the decentralized infospheres themselves will need the ability to discover and bind to each other.  Information producing clients, (e.g. sensor platforms, FBCB2 entities, etc.) and information consumers, (e.g. TACP, SOF, Strike Assets, etc.) will need to discover and bind to an existing infosphere to facilitate mission information sharing requirements.   Information management infrastructures (including clients) in this environment will need to rapidly adapt to changing network topologies and intermittent connectivity while maintaining the functional effectiveness.  

Successful white papers in this technical area will provide non-proprietary, modular components (including the delivery of source code) capable of being integrated into existing or emerging IM infrastructures.  The technical issues listed below identify specific concerns, but should not be used to limit or constrain innovative ideas: 

(a) Methods and approaches for dynamic infosphere instantiation, initialization, and self-identification

(b) Methods for dynamic infospheres to initialize in  pre-defined configurations based on operational and/or functional requirements

(c) Methods for instantiating with initial information sets

(d) Methods for automatic discovery and association with infospheres for either clients interactions or federate participation. 

Area (3):  Infosphere Federation.  This topic area seeks the development of information management technology to support the federation of information across multiple infospheres. The idea of a single, universal information space is unlikely to be achieved in any complex military or commercial endeavor. Wherever it is necessary to have multiple information spaces, it is anticipated that clients will need to acquire information across the infospheres.  Therefore the spaces themselves need to connect to create a federation that allows one information space to be 'extended' by the contents of the other.  

These infospheres will be organized and based on multiple factors such as geographic regions, functional requirements, organizational boundaries, and network topology/infrastructure.  The necessary modes of interaction will require higher-level services where service agreements between the infospheres manage the interactions in a seamless and efficient manner.  These information services connect information spaces together for the purpose of providing a 'single virtual' information space. The federation interfaces to the information space encompass trust management, confidentiality, integrity management, policy mediation, content filtering, information replication and pass-through processing.
 
Successful white papers in this technical area will provide non-proprietary, modular components (including the delivery of source code) capable of being integrated into existing or emerging IM infrastructures.  The technical issues listed below identify specific concerns, but should not be used to limit or constrain innovative ideas: 

(a)  Methods for performing information discovery across infospheres without prior knowledge of the existence of that information

(b)  Methods for seamless information sharing across information boundaries to satisfy both client demand and information management efficiencies.

(c)  Distributed trust mechanisms between infospheres

(d)  Role and policy mappings for discretionary and mandatory access

(e)  Information service agreements that enable the specification of: 

     a.  QoS requirements

     b.  Information sharing obligations 

     c.  Enforcement of obligations across infospheres

(f)  Mediation of inconsistent data standards

(g)  Methods for managing the lifecycle of the federation, addressing formation, dynamic adaptation, and dissolution.

<DESC>VA Maryland Heath Care System VAMHCS intends to award a sole-source contract to Bayer Diagnostics for Point of Care A1c analyzers, test cartridges and control kits.  The VAMHCS is basing its sole-source justification on an August 30, 2005 Point of Care Testing of Hemoglobin A1c report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality which provides data on all A1c testing devices.  In this report it states that there are twenty-one (21) devices that meet the NGSP Certification requirement.  Out of that twenty-one (21) devices there are nine (9) devices that have no interference with Hb variants and derivatives.  Out of those nine (9) there are three (3) devices that are CLIA waived for low complexity.  During VAMHCS research for this procurement it is determined that the Bayer analyzer is the only device that meets all three requirements for NGSP Certification, CLIA waived and no interference with Hb variants and derivatives.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>I2WD is requesting information on immediately available technologies and other measures that may be effective in detecting long, thin wires.  These wires are small gauge conductors, ranging from tens of meters to several hundred meters long.  These w ires can be run along the ground, suspended from vegetation and/or common utility poles, or buried just below the surface.  Approaches that have stand-off detection capabilities are desired.  Two areas of interest are detection from the air and detection f rom moving ground vehicles.   The intent of this RFI is to gather information to support a rapid acquisition decision (following a capability demonstration) and/or evaluate suitability for immediate and near-term experiments (2QFY07).  The demonstrations and experiments will be used to  validate existing technology and identify areas, which given additional investment, will provide increased capability. Directed development of value-added technologies may follow. Proposals and/or acquisition actions will be requested for capabilities hav ing merit.  Interested parties are encouraged to electronically submit a technical information paper (not to exceed 10 pages total, 12 point font, single line spacing). Acceptable file formats are MS word or Adobe PDF.  We encourage responses from industry, academia, government, and other research and development organizations.  The Government does not however, intend to pay for information received.  The affiliation and point of contact of the author should be clearly and prominently placed on the title page with the technology area (i.e. RADAR, EO, IR, LADAR, Fusion, etc) and technology readiness level (i.e. immediately available or developmental).  In addition to a concise description of the capability, papers should include a summary of test results and the conditio ns the test was performed, an empirical analysis that indicates the expected detection rate and false alarm rate (or similar estimates of performance) with clear stipulation of the underlying conditions and assumptions. Author biography and organizational background information should demonstrate a record of accomplishment in areas pertinent to the paper topic.   You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-RA (Mr. Govoni) or the following e-mail address: Mark.Anthony.Govoni@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Industry Day, Atlanta, Georgia. Construction Management Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Construction Management Contracts.  The Government intends to award up to four (4) Contracts.

On Monday, November 20, 2006, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct an Industry Day for Small Business Architect / Engineer firms which may be interested in interviewing with the Short Listed Architect / Engineer Firms as possible consultants (subcontractors) for up to four (4) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Construction Management Contracts. This Industry Day will be conducted in The Summit Exchange at The Summit United States Federal Building, 401 West Peachtree, Atlanta, Georgia, from 2 pm to 4 pm.  The Summit Federal Building is a secured Federal facility so additional time should be allowed to clear security prior to the meeting. 

The contracts to be awarded will be up to four (4) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Construction Management Contracts.  Each Contract will include a base year plus four (4) additional one year unilateral options.  The minimum ordering limitation is $5,000 per contract.  The maximum ordering limitation for each contract will be $20,000 per year. The Government?s program objectives for these contracts are: 1) Provide Construction Management Services in the eight (8) states in The Southeast Sunbelt Region; 2) Enable GSA to supplement its in-house resources by using the designated contract Construction Management Team as an extension of its staff; and, 3) To provide GSA with expert consulting services for a variety of technical tasks and projects.  For additional information, please go to www.FedBizOpps.Gov for the official project announcement.

Industry Days (formally termed Small Business Subcontracting Networking Sessions) are intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between qualified Small Business Firms in that community which may be qualified to bid as consultants on these contracts.

At this Industry Day, Small Business firms capable of providing Construction Management Services will be given an opportunity to meet the GSA Contract Team, listen to an explanation of the scope of the contracts and the contract procedures and methods, to participate in a question and answer session with Contract Team members, and to interview one-on-one with The Short Listed Firms.  All participants need to be aware that the Federal government is prohibited by law from attempting to influence the selection or non-selection of consultants / subcontractors.  Any contracts which may result from an interview at this session will be strictly private sector arrangements.  The Government will not be a party to them.

Questions about this IDIQ Industry Day should be directed to  David Gibson, GSA?s Small Business Advocate for The Public Buildings Service in The Southeast Sunbelt Region (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV.

<DESC>CLARIFICATION:    The Library of Congress solicitation, RFP#S-LC03013, for Information Retrieval services for the FEDLINK Program offers customers two service options for contracting with FEDLINK vendors which are as follows:   (1) RFP section F.2.2(a)  Direct-Pay.  Under the direct pay option, customers send their agency generated purchase order directly to the vendor.  An interagency agreement between the customer and LC is not required and the customer does not pay the FEDLINK administrative fee.  The vendor provides service, invoices the customer directly against the agency purchase order, and the vendor pays the FEDLINK administrative fee.  Direct-pay processes are described in detail in section F.3 of the RFP.   (2) RFP section F.2.2(b)  Transfer-Pay.  Under the transfer pay option, a customer transfers both FEDLINK administrative fees and estimated annual service dollars to LC via a signed interagency agreement or other LC-approved customer agency document authorizing the transfer of funds to LC.  On behalf of the customer, LC/Contracts issues a delivery order to the vendor in the amount specified on the interagency agreement or funds transfer document.  After receiving the delivery order, the vendor provides service to the customer and submits the customer's invoices to FEDLINK.  FEDLINK reviews the invoices, rejects improper ones, and pays acceptable ones from the customer's account.  Transfer pay processes are described in detail in section F.4 of the RFP.   THE TRANSFER PAY OPTION IS REQUIRED under this solicitation; all vendors responding to this solicitation must offer the Transfer Pay option.  The Direct Pay option may be offered in addition to the Transfer Pay option but is not mandatory.  Vendors shall NOT offer the Direct Pay option only.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address 

United States Postal Service, Supplies and Services Purchasing, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway Dewey Bldg, Merrifield, VA, 22082-8150

Description

The United States Postal Service is currently seeking a source to move equipment within and between exiting Postal Service facilities. The following Postal Service equipment will be included; DBCS, AFSM100 and SPBS Machines.  The following steps should be included; inspection, pre-teardown, teardown, relocation/installation, and post re-installation testing and performance requirements for from estimated 1 to 60 each of the respective Machines, including attached feed systems.
Requests for information and the program data submission should be provided to Mr. Mark Travers, Contracting Officer, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Merrifield, VA, 22082-8150, Telephone (703) 280-7953. Requirements: Specification System Relocation; DBCS, AFSM-100 AND SPBS Program.

Background:
 Reorganization of mail processing operations, including the installation of new mail processing equipment often make necessary the relocation of existing mail processing equipment.  Particularly impacted are the AFSM 100 and SPBS machines.  These systems require relocation, often, with relatively short notice.  There are hundreds of these respective machines located in mail processing facilities across the country.  
Variations in the location, installation, configuration, condition, etc. of these systems make necessary a pricing strategy that is flexible with a reasonable sharing of risks.  The best suited contract type is an indefinite delivery type contract with time and materials type features.  Firm fixed unit priced orders for each respective relocation is considered appropriate.    

SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES: For purposes of this process assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide performance data for similar relocation programs for USPS review. This information should include a complete description of a program which substantiates the vendor?s ability to meet the requirements in this specification. This written information shall be provided no later than December 01, 2006. Following USPS review of the submitted program performance data, pre-qualification determination will be made. Interested parties of this sources sought are to submit a total of two copies (one hard copy and one soft copy) of any company promotional handouts, brochures, catalogs. Overly elaborate responses are neither expected nor required. The USPS by issuance of this notice makes no commitment to accept the program as provided by the supplier.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) via National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to UCLA Microarray Core 695 Charles E. Young Drive South Los Angeles, CA 90095.  No period of performance.  The purchase is in conjunction with Protocol Study#03-M-0035 ?Screening, Evaluation, Diagnosis, Treatment Optimization and Follow-up for Childhood Onset Psychotic Disorders. The purpose of the research is to screen and evaluate children with psychotic disorders, establish or confirm their diagnosis, and to collect data about their condition.  Childhood Psychotic Disorders are debilitating conditions in which children have auditory or visual hallucinations and disorganized thoughts.  Using longitudinal brain imaging our research is pursuing the following questions: What is the pattern of brain development in childhood onset psychoses?  What is the relationship between the brain development pattern in COS and the clinical outcome? Is cortical gray matter loss as a trait marker?  And if so, how is cortical brain development influenced by the underlying risk genotype? Is the loss of gray matter diagnostically specific? An integral part of the research process in answering these questions requires the use of microarray chips. 

The Child Psychiatry Branch has an ongoing collaboration with the UCLA Department of Genetics, Microarry Core for the past three years. The laboratory owns Affymetrix instruments which is necessary to run the microarrays. This equipment is prohibitively expensive and we don?t have the lab space to conduct these assays, therefore we had to collaborate with UCLA to complete these experiments. In order to complete our initial screen of our rare cohort of childhood-onset schizophrenia patients, we need to run additional arrays.  It is imperative for us to continue using the same product from Affymetrix, and under the same laboratory conditions, otherwise the reliability and consistency of the research we have already collected, and at significant cost would be jeopardized. 

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI70016 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch 31, Center Drive, Bldg. 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892 Attention: Kathleen Gregory

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  
The intent of this acquisition is to procure up to 70 Cutter Boat -Larges (CB-L) vessels over a five (5) year period, along with the associated equipment, spare parts, and documentation necessary to support this fleet of boats.  The new CB-L will replace existing CB-Ls in the USCG fleet.  The existing CB-L is an open boat of the type commonly referred to as a Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) or Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB).
The CB-L will be deployed from USCG cutters (ships) in support of a wide range of missions including Search and Rescue, Law Enforcement, and Ports, Waterways and Coastal Security.   These Cutters can be deployed at sea anywhere in the world.
While the Cutter is underway, the CB-L will normally be stored in a cradle on deck, exposed to the weather.  This procurement will standardize the CB-L fleet throughout the USCG and offer DHS components the opportunity to procure CB-Ls off the same contracting vehicle.

The anticipated procurement will utilize GSA schedule 84, category 260-01 and target Small Business concerns only.  This RFI is to gather information with regard to the draft requirements; obtain pricing information and solicit interest to maximize competition.  All responses should be sent (electronicaly - preferaby) to LTJG Ty Mller at Tyler.D.Miller@uscg.mil, no later than 1600, 20 November 2006, EST.  SEE ADDENDUM FOR DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS.

<DESC>Pending the availability of funding, the U.S. Department of Education intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Dr. Susan Dynarski.  The purpose of this purchase order is to review and critique the preliminary analysis of the marginal benefits of the student financial assistance programs submitted to OMB in the fall of 2006.  OMB's President's Management Agenda scorecard for Budget and Performance Integration has set a target of December 31, 2006, for the Department to complete an independent report on the Department's preliminary analysis.  In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the Contracting Officer has determined that only one source, Dr. Susan Dynarski, is reasonably available to meet this requirement.

Dr. Susan Dynarski, associate professor of public policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, is a nationally recognized expert on higher education funding.  She has been a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research since 1999 and has written extensively on the impact of grants and loans on college attendance, the impact of government policy on college completion rates, and the distributional aspects of college savings initiatives.  She holds a master's degree in public policy from Harvard and a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Dr. Dynarski's article "Does Aid Matter?  Measuring the Effect of Student Aid on College Attendance and Completion" (American Economic Review, March 2003), was the foundation of the Department's preliminary analysis, which attempted to quantify the impact of increasing Federal grant aid on postsecondary enrollment.  Given her intimate familiarity with both the methodology used and available data sources, she is uniquely qualified to review and critique the analysis, as well as to offer insights on the feasibility of expanding the analytical approach.

The Department intends to execute this purchase order on or before November 17, 2006.

<SUBJECT>15 -- H-1 Upgrade Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Request For Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N0001907P7PBL
<RESPDATE>120806

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request For Information (RFI) Synopsis.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The following information is provided to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully support an H-1 Upgrade aircraft PBL product support strategy, and to exchange ideas with industry on how best to implement an H-1 Upgrade aircraft PBL program.

The U.S. Marine Corps H-1 Upgrades program is currently a combination of  remanufacture and new build of legacy warfighter aircraft to increase payload, power, endurance, and range.  The UH-1Y, replacement for the UH-1N, is a new build platform commencing with Lot III deliveries.  The AH-1Z, replacement for the AH-1W, is a remanufacture platform.  The program incorporates state of the art designs into the existing fleet of AH-1Ws and into the new build UH-1Ys.  A total of 180 AH-1Zs will be remanufactured and 100 UH-1Ys will be built.  The H-1 Upgrades aircraft will have several common systems such as: four-blade main and tail rotor systems; hinge-less and bearing-less main rotor system; updated drive train systems; crashworthy seats; and modified landing gear. The AH-1Z and UH-1Y will also have an integrated cockpit display to provide enhanced navigational reliability and accuracy, and a Helmet Mounted Sight Display that is compatible with all cockpit avionics and will improve weapons delivery.  The original equipment manufacturer and prime contractor for the H-1 Upgrades Program is Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.

The H-1 Upgrades program is currently in the latter stages of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  Low Rate Initial Production was approved in Oct 2003, with the first production aircraft delivering in FY 06.  The program is currently completing the first phase of a two-phase Operational Evaluation (OPEVAL) at Naval Air Warfare Station China Lake, California.  

H-1 Upgrade aircraft operate from Marine Corps Air Stations, Navy ships, and airfields, worldwide.  The H-1 Upgrade concept has three levels of maintenance (organizational, intermediate and depot).  O-level maintenance is performed by USMC personnel that have custody of the aircraft/equipment (inspecting, servicing, lubricating, adjusting, and replacing parts).  I-level maintenance is performed by designated maintenance activities for direct support of organizational activities (calibration, repair or replacement of damaged or unserviceable parts, components, or assemblies).  D-level maintenance is performed by designated maintenance facilities on material requiring major rework or a complete rebuild of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including manufacture, modification, testing, and reclamation of parts as required.  

The Navy/Marine Corps H-1 Upgrade aircraft have been designated as a Joint Chiefs of Staff planning scenario aircraft.  Accordingly, as delineated in Title 10 USC Sec. 2464, core capability must be supported by performing H-1 Upgrade depot maintenance at a Government owned and operated facility, by Government personnel.  For depot level maintenance, public-private partnership is the preferred approach to meet Title 10 USC Core logistics capability requirements.  Innovative approaches to providing a broad based support package that is efficient and embraces continuous process and product improvement, is being sought to optimize the life cycle support provided to the Navy/Marine Corps forces operating H-1 Upgrade aircraft, worldwide.  PBL support is being considered for all H-1 Upgrade aircraft, to provide a more cost-effective readiness solution.  PBL is a support strategy that places emphasis on meeting the needs of the Warfighter to project the most cost effective solution with an acceptable amount of risk.  Its primary tenets are to meet Warfighter requirements - system availability and reliability - as documented in the Performance Based Agreement.  The outcome of this activity is expected to result in improving overall life-cycle management of system availability, reliability, supportability, and total ownership costs.

For PBL, performance is defined by more than just managing parts.  PBL should be used as a form of sustainment to meet operational requirements - the right aircraft, in the right configuration, in the right place, at the right time.  Furthermore, the PBL should provide a process that will resolve obsolescence issues, and find ways to integrate support solutions.  To implement a successful PBL contract, contractors should be able to exhibit the capability to: 1) improve inherent design reliability 2) establish and execute Lean processes 3) reduce cost.  

The H-1 Upgrade program intends to engage with contractors in an Alpha process where there is a collaborative discussion between the government and the contractor.  Using this process the government will define the requirement(s) and metric(s).

We are looking for contractor PBL approaches that address all of the following areas:
 
- General Contracting Approach - to include recommendations regarding:
- Contract Relationships: traditional prime sub, thin prime/sub, joint venture, public/private teaming and/or sub-contractor contractual relationships that encourage flow-down of PBL concepts and incentives 
- Contract Type and Length 
- Payment based on: e.g. flight hours
- Metrics: e.g. NMC, system reliability and system availability
- Information Technology: established bidder?s infrastructure; familiarity with, and access to systems such as: NMCI, NALCOMIS, Emall, etc.
- Sustaining Engineering - to include inherent reliability improvements; development of changes/modifications; failure analysis; and maintenance engineering support of all three levels of maintenance.
- Supply Chain Management - to include the management of actions, procedures, and techniques necessary to determine requirements; to acquire, document, receive, store, transfer, issue and dispose of spares, repair parts, and supplies; provide Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation; comply with Unique Identification; and manage Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages/Obsolescence.
- Maintenance - to include approaches and experience in maintaining aircraft and associated components.  The contractor should explicitly address their approach to satisfy Title 10 requirements.
- Tech Support - to include approach for providing on-site technical support.
- Support Equipment/Automated Test Set (ATS) (peculiar and common) - to include approach for management of all support equipment (hardware & software/TPS) that will be required for the operation and maintenance of the aircraft.
- Training - to include all the appropriate processes, procedures, techniques, training devices, and equipment used to train flight crew, as well as O, I, and D level maintenance personnel, to operate and support a system.
- Technical Data/Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) - to include approach for management of technical data (i.e. technical maintenance and operator manuals, engineering drawings, and supporting graphics) in addition to the implementation of a long-range requirement to develop, deploy, and maintain IETMs.
- Configuration Management - to include the approach for documenting the configuration of each aircraft/system/component.
- Exit Criteria - to include approaches which will allow the government to continue sustainment in the event the contractor should fail to perform, or, does not negotiate in good faith at the end of the contract term.

Contractor responses should include information on all of the aforementioned areas pertaining specifically to the following H-1 Upgrade Systems: 1) airframe and integral systems, 2) mission systems, 3) Target Sighting System, 4) Helmet Mounted Sight Display.  (Refer to attachment (1) for a detailed description of the four break-out categories.)  Contractors may respond to any or all of these four sections.  Responses should not exceed 20 pages for each section.

Companies interested in responding to this request should mail the following: a company pamphlet, brochure, or short statement of the company's abilities/history with this type of service, the name and telephone number of a company representative that can be contacted, and the company's address.  Once responses are received, interested parties may be requested to provide a presentation to further describe their capabilities and allow an opportunity to exchange ideas on how best to provide cost-effective performance based outcomes for the H-1 aircraft.  Contractors should submit responses electronically to andrew.warner@navy.mil.  Hardcopy responses to this announcement can be submitted to:

<SUBJECT>High Energy Laser Weapon Systems Request for Information (RFI)
<DESC>Extends closing date on previously released Special Notice: The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane has a requirement in support of Naval Sea Systems Command’s Directed Energy and Electric Weapon Systems (DE&EWS) Program Office (PMS 405) and is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to determine the general availability of components / equipment / subsystems / systems that could comprise a High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) and to determine viability for integration into an incrementally-fielded, spiral capability HELWS for usage by all military services and Department of Homeland Security.  PMS 405 is interested in existing / planned efforts that would allow for leverage of existing and/or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items into militarily useful laser weapon systems within two to three years. Emphasis should be placed on an initial capability that could counter a subset of asymmetric threats such as jet skies, small boat swarm attacks, rockets, mortars, artillery rounds, manpads, electro-optic sensors, and soft unmanned !  aerial vehicles. The system should be multi-mission capable and able to support electro-optic surveillance missions as well as laser engagements. As laser and laser beam control technology matures the system should be able to support upgrades that expand the potential target set, surveillance capabilities and operating range of the system.  PMS 405 and its technical designees would be the Technical Design Agent responsible for integration of the various detect, track, process, and engage elements that will comprise HELWS baselines.  HELWS is projected to be:  •	Initially an independent capability that can be fielded as either a transportable system for land based use or as a stand-alone / minimally-integrated capability for ship board use. •	A future Navy shipboard capability that could be integrated into the ship's combat systems consistent with the Department of the Navy’s Open Architecture (OA) thrust to support future Surface Navy needs. Responses to this RFI should not exceed fifty (50) pages, including a one (1) page corporate capability and a statement of capability in engineering analysis.  The RFI must contain the following information: a system / subsystem / component capability statement which includes information on the type of technology used, producibility, a brief analysis of lethality, laser propagation and target vulnerability, pricing information, an assessment of risk and Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and a delivery schedule.  In the response, vendors should clearly mark any information that is proprietary.  Interested parties should list production-representative components / equipment / subsystems / systems that could be available for test / evaluation and/or integration at a government designated facility by March 2007.  Pricing and delivery information should be based in FY07 dollars. Responses are due by 12 January 2007.  Both e-mail and mail submittals will be accepted.  Responses should be sent to:  Commander, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, Code 80931, Bldg 3168, Attn:  Mr. William Wootton, 300 Highway 361 Crane, IN 47522-5001.

NOTE:  This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation.  In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.

<SUBJECT>B -- Development of Case Study pertaining to the Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Engine Rule
<DESC>Under the authority granted in FAR 13.501(a)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to make award of a contract, on a sole source basis,  to the Council for Excellence in Government (CEG), to develop a case study based on the impartial analysis of the collaborative effort  used  during the rulemaking process for Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule. 

The original analysis of  the process involved a  determination of which factors and principles contribute to a successful collaborative process.  The analysis included interviewing a limited number of key participants in the collaborative process for the rule and reviewing documents and articles relevant to it.  In addition, a training course was developed for how to conduct a collaborative process and a pilot class was conducted to ensure that the training materials developed have real-world functional utility. The last phase of the project is to develop the case study.

As a non-partisan organization, the CEG has the unique ability to conduct not only  impartial research and analysis of the collaborative process used in the EPA?s CleanAir Nonroad Diesel Engine Rule but also to create the detailed and concise case study which can be used by local, state, and federal government employees, as well as private sector personnel, to gain an understanding of how to implement a successful collaborative process to reach a positive outcome without resorting to command and control solutions and/or costly litigation. 

The Council for Excellence in Government (CEG) is the only known source that has the combination of experience, reputation, and skills determined necessary to perform this complete effort.  CEG has a unique depth of experience in public policy and governmental administration that is directly relevant to regulatory development.  CEG has testified before Congress numerous times concerning ways to improve government performance.  CEG also conducts several programs to educate and train government administrators and managers.  CEG?s training programs and analysis work involve and are oriented to achieve real world application by people that are working in the government.  It is critical that the results of this analysis and training course have real world application and that the contractor demonstrate a high level of experience in relevant ?on point? projects involving the real world activities of government officials and managers.   CEG has a reputation for being non-partisan.   It is critical to the success and credibility of this effort that the contractor provide an impartial analysis that will not be considered biased by the contractor?s reputation of political partisanship.  CEG offers personnel skilled in performing research and analysis of government practices and processes as well as well-respected training programs.  Market Research identified no organization other than CEG that had this unique combination of experience, reputation, and skills necessary to successfully perform the complete effort.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-06 Proposer's Day Conference for One-Shot Program
<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE

DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference in support of the Advanced Sighting System (One-Shot) program on November 20, 2006 at the Executive Conference Center located at 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia  22201 from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the One-Shot program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of Advanced Sighting System (One-Shot) program is to enable Snipers in the measurement of downrange crosswind (wind) and range to target and compensate the trajectory of the first round to accurately hit targets within the crosshair.  The system must operate over a range of visibilities, atmospheric scintillation, environmental and operating conditions and exploit novel technologies that address the overall requirements of this program.  It is anticipated that the ultimate system culminating from this investigation and development conducted in Phases 1 and 2 will provide performance summarized in an Annex to Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 07-03 (Classified). The BAA (excluding the Annex) will be posted to FedBizOpps at a later date. 

 

It is recognized that crosswind has the effect of deviating the bullet trajectory producing offsets in the hit point.  In some cases, a 10 mph wind could produce a miss even at 400 meters while in other cases; the deviation could be much worse ranging to approximately 3 meters at 1200 meters range.  The deviation increases as the wind velocity and/or the engagement range increases.  Current methods to compensate the bullet trajectory, under adverse combat conditions, are inadequate since they require a) a spotter to guide the shooter on target by observing wind velocity and direction, b) determining the hit point if the 1st round results in a miss, c) guessing range to target, and d) intense field training. 

 

Typically for long range shots, it is desirable to profile the downrange wind instead of measuring an average value since wind can change at various points along the range.  If the wind is profiled, it could increase the overall measurement time duration; introducing latency in measurements.  Therefore the system must be able to optimize the required accuracy in a given measurement period and the number of profiled segments.  Clearly, the greater the number of sampling segments, the better is the anticipated hit accuracy. Topography, pressure and temperature should therefore be considered in the estimation of the number of profiled wind segments.

 

Although substantial efforts have been made over a decade in measuring crosswind, two approaches have been commonly used.  These are, namely a) Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) and b) Coherent Doppler Lidar.  Although these techniques are useful for some applications, they do not seem to be adequate for this application. 

 

Proposers may consider any potential sensor technology, individually or in combination, or other effective sensor modalities which the Proposer considers to be technically superior or more affordable or both.  Proposers are reminded that 1) the time urgency of the need argues for mature technologies rather than immature technology requiring many years of development, and 2) end system affordability in production argues against unduly complex and expensive sensor solutions and system architectures.  

 

PROGRAM GOALS:  

Phase 1 Goals (Base Program):  In Phase 1, the Proposer shall demonstrate the technology of choice for estimating crosswind velocity, direction and range to target by modeling/simulations and validating the hit point accuracy by developing sufficient hardware to conduct field measurements.  At the end of Phase 1, the proposed approach must provide answers to the following questions: 

 

1.      Does the developed approach measure Crosswind?  

2.      If so, can it measure crosswind to the maximum effective range of the weapon? 

3.      What is the measurement accuracy of the proposed system compared to other errors (weapon, riflescope magnification, in-line night sight, etc.)?

4.      Is down range wind profiling required?  How often?  Does one need to measure wind in other directions? If not, what's the error?

5.      What is the maximum overall measurement time? 

6.      Does the simulation error agree with the field test data? 

7.      How accurately the approach measure range to target?  

8.      How does it minimize clutter while ranging target?

9.      What is the minimum and maximum offset error at various ranges and wind conditions?  

10.  How is the offset error signal presented to the User (Shooter or the Spotter)?

 

Phase 2 Goals (Option 1):  In Phase 2, the successful contractor will develop a prototype crosswind measurement and compensation system.  The SWAP of One-shot will be commensurate with battlefield operational and environmental requirements and interfaces with the weapon or spotting scope.  The desired system, as a minimum, will include the sensing and display elements that will be fully integrated with a riflescope (desired) or spotter's scope.  It is required that methods and design approaches for integrating the One-shot sensing and display technologies into the riflescope and/or spotting scope be identified, described and plan provided to demonstrate manufacturing in volumes along with potential cost matrix for the bill of materials (BOM).  

 

The contractor must provide the impact of the proposed sensing system on the battlefield concept of operation (CONOPS).  Substantial deviations from the current practices are discouraged.  Minor changes that improve the efficiency and ultimately the overall performance should be provided as part of the training resources and instruction sets, and will be part of the deliverables for this effort.  The desired system must be developed quickly on a rapid success-oriented schedule.  The desired system must be affordable in volume production.  

 

DARPA will be requesting proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations.  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to the BAA.

 

 

A SECRET facility clearance and a SECRET safeguarding clearance are required to perform under this BAA (beyond Proposers' Day).  Organizations that do not have BOTH of these clearances may still perform under this BAA by teaming with an organization that does.

 

Additional information on the One-Shot program, to include BAA07-03, the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), and DD Form 254,Contract Security Classification Specification, will be available at a later date.  Details regarding program objectives, development and integration schedule, and milestone criteria will be provided in a classified addendum to the associated program BAA.  To receive the classified addendum, your organization's CAGE code must list both the facility and safeguarding clearances, as a minimum, at the SECRET level.  Proposers are advised to email their Facility Security Officer's (FSO) name, phone number, secure fax number, and classified registry mailing address, and CAGE code to Mark.Doody@darpa.mil as soon as possible in order to receive the classified addendum in time to prepare their proposal accordingly.  The classified addendum, when available, will be sent ONLY to each organization's FSO.

<CONTACT>Dana Herndon, 301-619-7140
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  THIS IS AMENDMENT NO. 0003 TO SOLICITATION NO. W81XWH-07-BIOSTATISTICIAN.  This amendment provides the answers to several questions that have been requested in writing. 1.  Do offerors need to include the Quality Control Plan (QCP) at the time responses are submitted or can the QCP be established after contract award through discussions with the Government, including the Government end user? The Quality Control Plan (QCP) may be established after award through discussions with the Government, including the Government end user.  The QCP would then be entered into the award document by way of a modification.  As a result of this decision, the of feror will not be penalized for non-submission of the QCP at this time.  The QCP will need to be finalized within 30 days following contract award. 2.  In section 5.3 Consulting, the RFQ indicates that the candidate must have a record of developing innovative materials.  Can you more fully explain what is meant by innovative materials and give some examples of innovative materials? The question is intended to show that the contractors employee is able to go beyond following the direct instructions of the client. The consultant proposes and supports a broader range of biostatistical approaches, as appropriate. This can be as simple a s convincing a client that a Wilcoxon test is more appropriate than a t-test in a certain situation. It can be as complex as publishing new statistical theory to support analyses that could not otherwise be addressed. 3.  Does the Government require that contractor pricing come from a published GSA type schedule (such as MOBIS)?    No.  If not, what level of pricing detail is required to support a Firm-Fixed-Price quote?

4) ADVERTISING OF AWARD

The contractor shall not refer to this award in commercial advertising, or similar promotions. This includes advertising, or similar promotions, in all forms or electronic, broadcast, and print media. In addition, the contractor is restricted from reproducing the image(s) of the EOP in any form of commercial advertising, or similar promotion.  This includes images of official seals and buildings.  The reproduction of official seals and the images of buildings are a matter controlled by regulation and Executive Order.  Any proposed usage of such symbols must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer.

5) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR): 

The COTR will monitor all technical aspects of the contract.  The types of actions within the purview of the COTR's authority are to assure that the Contractor performs the technical requirements of the contract, and to notify both the contractor and the Contracting Officer of any deficiencies observed.  A letter of designation will be issued to both the COTR and the Contractor at the time of contract award setting forth the responsibilities and limitations of the COTR.

It is important to note that while the COTR will be responsible for administering the performance of work under this contract, in no event will any understanding, agreement, modification, change order, or other matter deviating from the terms of this contract be effective or binding upon the Government unless proper, formal contractual documents are executed by the Contracting Officer prior to completion of the contract.

6) PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: 

All data and information that is required in the performance of this task is unclassified, and a security clearance is not required in performance of this effort.  However, access to the White House Complex (including the New Executive Office Building and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) requires approval by the EOP Office of Security and Emergency Preparedness Office (OSEP).  Approval is granted after suitability is determined by considering the results from a name check performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Contractors must allow fifteen working days prior to the projected start date for a name check to be processed and approved by the OSEP.   All Contractor personnel must be 18 years of age and U.S. citizens.

Contractors are responsible for providing personnel who meet EOP personnel security requirements.  In this regard, contractors are expected to perform initial background checks of potential employees.  Failure to do so results in an unnecessary delay of beginning of contract performance; results in a waste of Government resources to do background checks on individuals who contractors should have pre-screened; may result in unfavorable past performance evaluations for the contractor, because of a failure to meet contract requirements; and may be a factor for evaluation of any award fees, if applicable.

Contractor personnel who require access to the complex for longer than 90 days will also be required to undergo a full-field FBI investigation, and other background investigations as deemed appropriate.  Contractors must provide information to complete the full field background investigation within two weeks after their start date at the White House Complex or within two weeks of being notified that their work will extend for longer than a 90 day period.  Permanent access (beyond 90 days) is granted only after EOP OSEP review and approval of the results of the investigations.

7) CONTRACTOR PLAN ON ESTABLISHING COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES FOR A DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE

All Contractor employees who work on this contract will be required to submit to and successfully pass a drug test prior to placement on the contract.  The Office of Administration, Human Resources Management Division will arrange for the drug test at no cost to the Contractor.

The Contractor is required to submit a drug testing plan for all of its employees who will be working on-site.  This requirement is in addition to FAR Clause 52.223-6, Drug Free Workplace.

The Contractor's drug testing plan shall provide testing equivalent to that covered in the EOP Drug-Free Workplace Plan and comply with relevant provisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration,  Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing, effective September 1, 1994.  The EOP plan and HHS guidelines may be reviewed by arrangement with the Contracting Officer.

At a minimum, the Contractor's plan shall provide for drug testing of all employees who will be located at the Government's work site.  The testing must occur, and the results of a clear drug test must be confirmed in writing to the OA Human Resources Management (HRM) Division  before any employee begins to work at the Government work site.  In addition, the Contractor's plan must provide for the periodic random drug testing of employees during the term of the contract and any exercised options.

The Contractor's plan for drug testing shall follow the procedures described in the HHS guidelines, listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, effective September 1, 1994, and published in the Federal Register at 53 FR 11979.  This document can be viewed on the internet at http://www.drugfreeworkplace.gov/oDrugTesting/MGuidelines.htm.  In the event that a Contractor's employee tests positive for any substance referred to above, and the test is verified by the Contractor as un-attributable to an excusable source, for example, a properly prescribed medication, the OA HRM must be notified immediately, and the employee may be removed from performance of the contract.

The Contractor is responsible for submitting a report of the number of employees tested on a random basis and the results of random testing.  The report should also include those instances where employees were removed from the performance of this contract for testing positive for drug use.  This report shall be submitted to the OA HRM via the OA Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) semi-annually.

8) STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND RESTRICTIONS: 

The contractor shall conform to standards of conduct as follows:

(a) Contractor employees shall dress appropriately for a professional office environment.

(b) No contractor employees shall solicit new business while performing work under this contract on Government premises.

(c) The contractor and his/her employees shall refrain from discussion with unauthorized persons any information obtained in the performance of work under this contract.

(d) The contractor and his/her employees shall conduct only such business as covered by this contract during periods paid by the Government.  Business not directly related to this contract shall not be conducted on Government premises.

(e) Use of Government furnished equipment or records for company or personal use is strictly prohibited.  Use of Government telephones to make personal, long distance phone calls at the Government's expense is prohibited.

(f) While the contractor's employees are at the Government facility, the contractor is responsible for compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations governing conduct with respect to health, safety, and use of Government property.  This relates not only to the health and safety of contractor employees and agents, but also that of Government personnel and other individuals.  While on Government premises or at home and in the possession of Government property, the contractor is responsible for such property and damages thereto.

(g) Contractor employees are expected to adhere to the high professional ethical standards to which Government personnel in a comparable position would be expected to adhere.  In addition, contractor employees must comply with the pertinent provisions of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1987, Pub. L. 101-189, 41 U.S.C. 423.
