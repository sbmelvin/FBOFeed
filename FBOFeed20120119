<SUBJECT>IDIQ Airfield Paint and Rubber Removal

<RESPDATE>030612
<CONTACT>Rick L Murrow, Phone 580-213-6054, Email rick.murrow.ctr@vance.af.mil
<DESC>CSC Applied Technologies LLC (CSC) is contemplating the issue of solicitation IFB158B for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Maintain Airfield Pavements Paint and Rubber Removal. Should an IDIQ contract result, any resulting work will be purchased by issue of a Delivery Order against the IDIQ contract. The contemplated solicitation would include work at Vance AFB to include airfield painting of markings on three runways, all taxiways, aircraft parking areas and Base street striping and marking, and is expected to include rubber removal on three runways as needed. Work is expected to also involve painting one non-precision asphalt runway markings, concrete aircraft parking area and concrete taxiway centerlines at Kegelman Auxiliary Air Field as needed. If awarded the IDIQ contract will have an effective period of approximately 31 calendar months from date of award through 30 September 2014 (Unit Costs for work in the IDIQ will be valid from date of award of IDIQ contract through 30 September 2014) and will include unit pricing by year that will be submitted by bidders as part of the Unit Price Book. No bid bond will be required because there is no specific dollar amount being bid. If a contract results 100% Payment and 100% performance bonds will be required for the amount of each delivery order issued. Bidders will be required to show proof of their ability to bond as part of their bid. Bidders should consider the impact to their bonding capacity when considering bidding on this IDIQ. Estimated maximum dollar amount of the entire IDIQ if completely funded for the entire 31 months is expected to be less than $1M. A single delivery order per year is anticipated for all work that can be done within available funding for any twelve month period. Minimum delivery is expected to be only one delivery order the first contract year and is anticipated to be less than $250K. Should funds for a minimum delivery in the first contract year be provided, no minimum delivery or dollar amount will apply for any following IDIQ contract year(s) and additional delivery orders may or may not result. Funds are not currently available for the contemplated IDIQ and have not been promised or guaranteed. There shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government or CSC should funding not be provided. In the absence of funding for a minimum delivery order in the first contract year no IDIQ contract will result.
<p>The work consists of furnishing all labor, equipment, quality control inspection and reports, materials and all other necessary supplies, fuels, lubricants, fluids, solvents, parts, tools, required to perform all operations in connection with removal of rubber and paint from primarily concrete airfield pavement surfaces and the repainting of markings. Also included is the surface preparation and layout of new and existing markings and application of traffic paints and reflective media to airfield and base street concrete or asphalt pavements in accordance with the specification and project drawings. Vance AFB is an AETC training Base which uses T-6, T-1 and T-38 aircraft for pilot training. These lighter aircraft do not typically create a great amount of built up rubber to be removed and the majority of removal is on one end of two runways due to more aircraft recoveries occurring on these ends because of predominate winds. The contractor will be allowed to paint or remove rubber on only one runway at a time and only during non-flying hours or when the Airfield is closed. This is due to the need for all runways to accomplish the training mission.</p>
<p>Contractor certification of equipment paint and rubber removal rates using a vehicle mounted non-chemical water blast method capable of removing 95% of rubber deposits at a rate of 10,000SF/Hr and 95% of existing paint at a rate of 1,000SF/Hr will be required. A satisfactory past performance history of work accomplished on an active military airfield or commercial airfield is required. Each bidder's Unit Price Book will be used in predetermined estimated quantity Schedules for comparison between bidders to arrive at an apparent low bidder for this effort. Cost and Past Performance will be considered as equal in determining the apparent low responsible bidder.</p>
<p>NAICS 237310, <br />Small Business Set Aside <br />Small Business Size $33.5M. <br />Magnitude of the entire IDIQ $500K - $1M.<br />Estimated Solicitation Issue Date: February 2, 2012</p>

<DESC>This is a Presolicitation as defined in FAR 15.201(c)(5). DMS&amp;T and IP are seeking ideas for manufacturing technologies that meet the intent as directed by Congress and that serve as the bridge between science and technology development and implementation of these developments in the field. The primary focus of IBIF is the domestic defense industrial base. The objective is to ensure that the domestic defense industrial capabilities on which the Department of Defense (DoD) depends is reliable, cost-effective, commercially competitive, and responsive to DoD requirements and can be sustained, even when demand for certain products or technical expertise temporarily declines. The technical focus is on the development, demonstration and deployment of foundational technologies that enhance manufacturing productivity and enhance cost-effectiveness, so as to support addressing surge requirements or diminishing manufacturing sources.

<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>AG-6395-S-12-0027 UGMA Moisture Meters Purchase<br />USDA, GIPSA Technology and Science Division
<p>Background</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates a laboratory in a privately-owned building: 10383 North Ambassador Drive, Kansas City Missouri 64153. The laboratory operates under the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), Technology and Science Division (TSD).</p>
<p>The USDA GIPSA Technology and Science Division is responsible for maintaining the reference methods for all official services provided by GIPSA to facilitate the marketing of grain. It is also responsible for developing and maintaining methods for accurately predicting the quality of grain and grain products moving through the U.S. marketplace. In order to provide the highest quality service needed to minimize variability in the testing methods, GIPSA has standardized to specific methods and/or equipment within the Official Inspection Service. Only these specific methods/equipment can be used by any entity providing testing service as either a GIPSA lab, an official agency, or State that is designated or delegated to perform work on behalf of GIPSA.</p>
<p>Measuring moisture content in grain is a critical factor for official inspection. To obtain accurate, repeatable, and fast results required for official grain inspection, GIPSA has long used moisture meter technology. Currently GIPSA is using Dickey-john's GAC2100 as the exclusively allowed moisture meter within the Official Inspection system. This instrument has been in use for over 10 years and is at the end of its lifespan. The GAC2100 requires maintenance of separate calibrations for each type of grain/oilseed which is a significant cost to GIPSA.</p>
<p>For many years GIPSA has conducted research into new technology to improve the accuracy and repeatability of grain moisture meter testing. The research found benefits to measuring at a higher radio frequency (about 149 MHz). The result is the development of the Unified Grain Moisture Algorithm (UGMA). GIPSA's research over multiple crop types and years showed that using the UGMA greatly improved the accuracy and precision of moisture results, reduced the "moisture rebound" effect associated with freshly harvested grain, and required only one calibration curve for all types of grains and oilseeds (though a few simple "unifying parameters" are required for each "grain group"). Basically the effects of variables such as sample temperature, geographic origin, variety, crop year, density and kernel moisture distribution are greatly reduced when using the UGMA technology.</p>
<p>During the course of the research, GIPSA has made information available and, when requested and Non-disclosure Agreements signed, provided assistance in developing UGMA-compatible instruments. GIPSA has been working directly (although confidentially) with several manufacturers. GIPSA's intent to standardize on this technology has been publicized for almost 10 years and GIPSA's Grain Inspection Advisory Committee was updated on the technology multiple times and has recommended proceeding in this technology.</p>
<p>Contract Scope/Deliverables</p>
<p>The two prime technical requirements for instruments are they MUST have NTEP-certification through GIPSA's TSD lab and they MUST be certified as UGMA-compatible through testing by our lab. UGMA-compatibility is crucial to permit the instruments to utilize GIPSA's UGMA calibrations and to give equivalent results to any other UGMA-compatible moisture meter.</p>
<p>GIPSA currently owns about 105 instruments that will need to be replaced. GIPSA intends to split the purchase among viable alternatives to ensure the continued availability of UGMA-compatible instruments from multiple sources. There are approximately an additional 500 known instruments needed by various agencies and entities which conduct grain sampling.</p>
<p>GIPSA requires delivery of instruments (around 100) by approximately June 1 to allow for full implementation by August 1, 2012.</p>
<p>Instruments would be shipped to multiple GIPSA locations throughout the United States</p>
<p>A one-year warranty is expected to be included for each instrument at no additional charge. The life cycle of the equipment is expected to be at least 10 years. Since the meters would have NTEP-certification and be certified as UGMA-compliant through testing in our lab, first-article testing is not needed. The current NTEP-certified instruments are currently present in the TSD laboratories participating in the ongoing NTEP grain moisture meter calibration program, so TSD is collecting extensive data that can be used for further assessment of UGMA-compatibility.</p>
<p>GIPSA intends to split the purchase among viable alternatives to ensure the continued availability of UGMA-compatible instruments from multiple sources. Since all NTEP/UGMA-certified instruments would be on the GIPSA Approved Equipment List the headquarters lab must, at a minimum, maintain copies of all models. The split between the competing vendors will not necessarily be 50/50.</p>
<p>Proposal Submittal</p>
<p>There are currently only two vendors who meet the prime technical requirements. As such, this is most likely a limited source procurement. The two sources are:<br />1. Dickey-john (GAC 2500b) <br />2. Perten Instruments (Aquamatic 5200)</p>
<p>Manufactures (NOT distributers) interested or capable of supplying these instruments shall contact Nathan Johnson via email (Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov).</p>

NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  <br><br>The US Army Contracting Command-Redstone has a requirement for a one year contract with options to be awarded in fiscal year 2013 for PBL Supplies/Services and Sustainment/Operational Support for the Shadow TUAS Program.  It is anticipated that the one year contract will have a period of performance of 1 Nov 12 - 31 Oct 13 and will be awarded on contract W58RGZ-12-C-0011.  The contract will be for a performance based Contractor Managed Supply and Maintenance effort that consists of field supply support, depot level supply support, depot-level maintenance, software support, total package fielding, sustainment training, field service support, field service operations, sustainment management, PBL engineering and management, depot material repair and management, and post deployment software support.  The Sustainment/Operational Support will consist of Brigade Integration Training (BIT), New Equipment Training (NET), Presets, Resets, Government Owned Contractor Operated teams in theater, and contractor augmentation teams in theater.  The options will be for additional Presets, Resets, and BIT/NET events.  <br><br>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 United States Code 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii) (B).  The proposed acquisition of this effort is directly related to the ongoing and future work being performed by the Shadow prime contractor, AAI Corporation, York Road and Industry Lane, Hunt Valley, MD  21030, CAGE CODE 97384.  This requirement must be restricted for the following reasons: 1) AAI Corporation is the only source with the corporate knowledge, expertise, and facilities to execute all basic sustainment requirements for the Shadow TUAS Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program, 2) Many of the components of the Shadow TUAS are proprietary, and the Government does not currently own a Technical Data Package suitable for full and open competition, 3) The technology is state of the art and duplication of the effort would require lengthy development and would impact the Shadow TUAS readiness rate. <br><br>Firms that recognize and can provide the required PBL and Sustainment/Operational Support are encouraged to identify themselves.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement and proposal which shall be considered.  <br>

<DESC>The government intends to issue a Sole Source contract to Beaufort Radiology Associates, P.A. for Radiologist services for a base period of 6-months.  Beaufort Radiology Associates, P.A. is currently providing these services under contract N62645-07-C-4018.

The bridge contract shall be placed in anticipation of the award of a long term agency contract resulting from a competitive solicitation.  The current contract is due to expire on 30 March 2012.  The long-term, competitive requirement experienced unanticipated delays with getting a complete package from the requiring activity, which has set the plan of action and milestones behind schedule.  It has been the intent of this office to compete this requirement upon receipt of a completed package in a timeframe commensurate with the Procurement Administrative Lead Time (PALT) for procurement of an agency contract less than $50M.
  The current PALT timeline for a requirement of this nature is 12 months.  The original anticipated start date of the long term requirement was 31 March 2012.  However, a completed package was not received in this office until 03 January 2012, thus not allowing sufficient time to follow all required acquisition processes prior to the required start date of services.  Delays with the requiring activity included identifying and agreeing upon a proposed contract vehicle as well as providing approval of the statement of work.  Due to these delays, there is not sufficient time to receive responses, conduct evaluations, make an award, and reasonably expect there would be enough time for a contractor to be able to recruit for and fill the positions by 31 March 2012.
  These factors combined have resulted in the need to issue a short-term bridge contract in order to avoid a lapse in service and maintain current staffing levels.  The base period for these services will be 31 March 2012 through 30 September 2012.  The new anticipated start date for the long term requirement is 01 October 2012.  

However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product.

All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment within 15 days of this posting to Erik Przygocki, erik.przygocki@med.navy.mil. No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's decision to contract with Lockheed Martin Corp. via single source procedures.

Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) intends to award a non-competitive contract to Lockheed Martin Corp, under the Simplified Purchase Method to provide the Terminal Services Group in support of Terminal Field Operational Support Group to purchase twelve (12) Rackmaster AP-1 Chassis (Part Number 7413009-00, NSN: 5895-01-53-1811) with REQUIRED internal components and hardware specifications used by the FAA Terminal Field Operational Support Group.

Lockheed Martin Corp. is the only known source that can supply the remaining units. 
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in delivering such services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.

<DESC><br />Notice of Intent to Award
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order to UBM Global Trade Inc to provide relevant data required to support their mission to ensure safe and legitimate pharmaceuticals are imported into the United States.</p>
<p>The Import Operations Branch (IOB) currently utilizes import trade data from the Port Import Export Reporting Service (PIERS) to assist Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)/ Office of Compliance (OC ) in its fact finding mission related to import and exports. CDER/OC's mission is to promote and protect public health through strategies and actions that minimize consumer exposure to unsafe, ineffective, and poor quality drugs. IOB is specifically responsible for handling compliance questions from all FDA field compliance offices across the country; Developing sampling programs to be implemented countrywide; Working with Customs and Border Protection on imports questions; and Working with other CDER Offices to make imports and exports compliance decisions. The current system of import entry information, the Operational and Administrative System for Import Support (OASIS), is limited to very few fields. The fields include country of origin; FDA product code, manufacturer; and shipper. In addition, OASIS was developed and implemented in 1996 to collect minimal information on imported products.</p>
<p>Acquiring these components from one source will provide a single point of contact for ordering, staging deliveries, and accountability for delivery issues and non-performing units or components. Due to the quantities being ordered and multiple delivery locations, it is of paramount importance to ensure that deliveries are appropriately coordinated and FDA's administrative oversight is minimized. The period of performance for this requirement is from date of award through base with four option periods. The NAICS code is 519130.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation document is available. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give notification to the Contract Specialist by 8:00am local eastern time on February 02, 2012. Interested firms must furnish supporting evidence with sufficient detail to demonstrate its ability to comply with the requirement described above. Interested firms may email the information to the Contract Specialist, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attn: Vida Niles at the email below.</p>
<p>The FDA will review all responses received; however, the Government retains the sole discretion not to further compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice. If the FDA does not receive any responses, the FDA will proceed with a base award with four option periods to: UBM Global Trade Inc, 2 Penn Plaza East, Suite 3, Newark NJ 07105-2251</p>
<p>The anticipated award date of this Purchase Order is on or around March 01, 2012.</p>
<p><br />THE FDA WILL NOT ACCEPT TELEPHONE CALLS. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Vida Niles via email at vida.niles@fda.hhs.gov</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology plans to procure on a sole source bases with FEI Company, 5350 N.E. Dawson Creek Dr., Hillsboro, OR 97124 for maintenance of the government-owned CM10 Philips Electron Microscope, serial number D869.
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard in $19.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance for the government-owned CM10 Philips Electron Microscope serial number D869, Goniometer and accessories.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide: 1) two (2) preventive maintenance inspections per component during the contract period; 2) emergency repair services on an unlimited basis during the term of this contract; 3) software service in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures, to include telephone access to technical support for use of program software and troubleshooting of the operating systems; and 3) all required replacement parts, with the exception of consumable parts to include batteries. Parts shall be new or remanufactured to original equipment specifications. Personnel shall have a minimum of one year factory training and experience in servicing the type of equipment covered by this contract. All primary service personnel shall have at least one backup support who shall have at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this contract.</p>
<p>This repair is required to maintain laboratory accreditation. To maintain the highest standard performance, complex scientific instruments are required to be maintained and serviced by the original manufacturer. FEI Company bought out the Philips Company and are now in one in the same. FEI has experienced technicians for servicing NCI's Philips electron microscope. The microscope is over 30 years old and only the manufacturer has parts and certified technicians to make repairs and maintain the EM Scope at peak performance. Over the past 15 years NCI has used FEI because of its association with Philips and the specific training of its technicians on servicing of Philips Electron Microscopes. The company's technicians have the best response time to emergency calls, NCI receives a call back within an hour and the technician arrives within 24 hours. FEI stocks spare parts for the microscope which reduces the down time of NCI's clinical service. The annual cost of repair performed without this service contract would eclipse the total cost of this contract. To sustain the high level of precision required for operation, periodic maintenance (beyond end-user ability) is required. Without such maintenance, generation of high quality, reproducible data is compromised. Because FEI is the sole vendor possessing the capability to inspect, repair, upgrade, and maintain the Philips Electron Microscope FEI is uniquely qualified to service NCI's electron microscope. NCI knows of no other source capable of providing these services.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 2, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at wardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-120028-MW on all correspondence.</p>

The NIH-CRM's main focus is the generation and differentiation of iPSCs to study their functionality and their use as potential therapeutics.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Sigma-Aldrich Corporation is the sole source provider of the Zinc Finger Nuclease Compozr&reg; Kits. Sigma-Aldrich currently holds exclusive rights to zinc finger nucleases technology for research purposes under licenses granted and/or sublicensed from Sangamo Biosciences, John Hopkins University, MIT, Scripps, the University of Utah, the MRC and Caltech. Sigma-Aldrich is the only worldwide commercial source of zinc finger nuclease Compozr Kits for research use. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325998, with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-55 (January 3, 2012). This requirement is under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) of $150,000.00.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with Flightline Electronics, Inc., DBA Ultra Electronics Flightline Systems for 1553 Data Bus Network Testers (P/N S2476N) to support CV-22 and MV-22 Aircraft at the Organizational Level of Maintenance. The 1553 Data Bus Network Testers are ruggedized, hermitically sealed units that are manually calibrated by the end user. They are computerized multiplexed digital data distribution systems. The network functions are command, control, communication and intelligence. P/N S2476N is the only tester tested, verified and certified to be used on the V-22 aircraft and the only tester meeting V-22 aircraft requirements. It is the only tester that has been designed to the environmental and EMI hardening requirements required for organizational level shipboard utilization. The interface adapter cable sets were specifically designed to interface the 1553 Data Bus Network Tester, P/N S2476N, to the V-22 aircraft. In addition, the S2476N Data Bus Network Tester has a fault isolation capability not found in other testers. The S2476N databus tester measures signal loss over a databus loop without the need for a specific algorithm. By positioning the transmitter and receiver modules at various databus stubs (Weapons Replaceable Assembly (WRA) locations) the maintainer can determine if the problem is wiring related, and if so, isolate the loss to a particular wiring segment or component (coupling transformer, etc.) leading to a more definitive and efficient repair process. The S2476N is a bus wiring tester and does not require the databus to be powered and running or even to have the WRA's connected in order to perform its functions. Anticipated delivery date is four months after contract award. The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a response which may be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract.

This IDIQ contract includes a variety of engineering services for the repair and conversion of the MK 105 and the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS 53).  The use of task orders will provide the flexibility necessary for the different types of work required.  Under this IDIQ, EDO will provide for repair, modification and overhaul of the MK 105 and AMNS 53 systems.  This includes all depot repairs and incorporation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), including the generation of all Integrated Logistics Support documentation to support the conversions.
  This effort is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.   a)  EDO is the manufacturer and the only source for the two systems listed above.  As such, only EDO has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above.  EDO is the Depot facility for the above Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) systems.  EDO is the Software Support Activity and the Drawing Configuration Manager for the MK 105 and AMNS 53 systems.  The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at EDO under Contractor control.
   b)  Given the complexity of the MK-105 and AMNS systems and the level of system knowledge required overhauling and repairing this complex equipment and systems, EDO is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking.  c)  This is a follow-on to contract N61331-09-D-0005 for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
 In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.     NAICS Code:  541330, Size Std: $27.0M FSC Code: R425

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a sole source contract to the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) for a duration of five (5) years. The proposed action provides access to MARTA transit fare media for NRC employees for official travel. MARTA is the only vendor that provides these services in Fulton and DeKalb counties. The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. A determination may be made by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice and it is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation is available. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 12. NRC intends to purchase the services from MARTA. The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition is FAR Part 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), where only one responsible source and no other supply or service will satisfy agency requirements. MARTA is the only licensed public transportation provider for Fulton and DeKalb counties that can provide the required services. Interested parties may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 3:00 pm EST on December 15, 2011. For further information, please contact James Leedom at 315-405-8102 or James.Leedom@nrc.gov.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue a solicitation in March 2012 for a contractor to construct/install an ice flushing system at Snell Lock in Massena, New York. The final design is not yet complete at this time; however, the work site is now dewatered and accessible for inspection and this will be the only time prior to award of a contract that the entire site will be fully accessible. The Corporation plans to conduct site visits for interested contractors at 1:00 PM on Thursday, February 2, 2012 and on Tuesday, February 7, 2012. Attendees must 1) make arrangements&nbsp;by calling Doug MacQueen at 315-764-3254 Tuesday through Friday between the hours of 6:30 AM and 5:00 PM, 2) come equipped with safety-toed shoes, hardhats and safety glasses and 3) sign a liability release form prior to the site visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Snell Lock is a navigation lock that is 80 feet wide and 860 feet long from gate to gate and&nbsp;raises and lowers vessels approximately 43 feet. Snell Lock is open from late March until late December each year and typically during the opening and closing periods, ice needs to be flushed from the lock to make room in the lock for transiting vessels.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The preliminary designs for the project include installation of seven (7) steel pipes fifty (50) feet in length having approximate cross-sectional areas of twelve (12) square feet to be embedded in the concrete gate sill with intakes upstream of the miter gate and outlets in the downstream face of the miter gate sill. Each pipe will be fitted with two (2) knife gates having openings approximately six (6) feet wide and two (2) feet high with one (1) knife gate being hydraulically operated and the other manually operated. It is anticipated that the work will require removal of approximately 1,500 cubic yards of concrete and placement of approximately 1,000 cubic yards of steel reinforced concrete to install the steel pipes and to enlarge a concrete gallery. The work will also include connecting the knife gate operators to existing hydraulic power units, integrating the controls for the new valves with the existing lock operating controls and installing a new access stairway. The work will occur over a two (2) year period beginning in January 2013 due to the short winter shutdown periods (i.e. approximately ten (10) weeks) when the lock can be dewatered. Work that will not interfere with navigation can be accomplished during the navigation season. <br /><br />Drawings are attached to this notice.</span></p>

<a href="mailto:meghan.mccloskey@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department Veterans Affairs (VA) Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record Enterprise Program Management Office (VLER EPMO), in partnership with the Office of Disability and Medical Assessment (DMA) of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the Compensation Service of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) will be holding a two-day industry day on January 26-27, 2012 in Washington, DC. The purpose of the industry day is to solicit commercial/government off-the-shelf (GOTS/COTS) product demonstrations as part of market research toward identifying potential candidate solutions or solution components for an enterprise Disability Benefits Questionnaire and Medical Assessment (DBQMA) Service solution. The business need supports the notion of a common access point and system that will standardize, centralize and integrate, through a clinical workflow, the universal collection and case management of disability and separation medical evaluation data to support a streamlined, efficient, paperless, and Veteran/Servicemember-centric disability claims process. 

The anticipated agenda is as follows: on 26 Jan 2012 - the doors open for registration from 8:00am to 8:30am; DBQ & Compensation & Pension Process overview from 8:30am to 10:30am; then 45 minute one-on-one product demonstration sessions from 10:45am to 5:30pm, continuing the next day 27 Jan 2012 from 8:00am to 5:30pm. Please note that the 45 minute product demonstrations may be lengthened or shortened depending on the number of participating vendors. 

Registration is required for attendance.  The meeting will be held at the VHA Conference Center located at Crystal City in Arlington, VA 22202. No meals will be served at the conference center; however, refreshments will be available at the food court for a nominal fee. Please email Stewart Maestas ( Stewart.Maestas@va.gov ) with the names of individuals (limit 3 in-person participants per vendor) who intend to participate in the industry day, plus a point-of-contact e-mail address for each vendor so a registration confirmation message and other information can be provided. All of the above information must be received by 5:00pm PST, 25 Jan 2012.  Contact Stewart Maestas @ 202-461-9035 if you do not receive the confirmation e-mail the day prior to the event. For updated information on industry day, including schedule changes or cancellation notices, visit www.fbo.gov ("FedBizOps.gov"). 

PROGRAM OVERVIEW:  VHA and VBA are working together to accelerate and streamline the disability claims adjudication and separation process by enhancing its capability to collect the required medical evidence to document and adjudicate a claim. This includes expanding the pool of available clinicians to speed the collection of high quality data from clinician to adjudicator. Currently, VA lacks a clinical workflow system that universally assists healthcare professionals in providing quality, timely and complete medical evaluations while simultaneously generating that medical evidence directly from clinician to adjudicator or other users.  Providing a real-time solution that guides VA and non-VA clinicians through a highly customizable and configurable clinical protocol, based on the Veterans/Servicemembers' claimed conditions, along with a way to automatically submit focused information to the adjudicator will not only streamline the disability claims process but permits VA to utilize resources efficiently.  This centralized clinical workflow solution will provide a control for implementation of more cost-effective workload management strategies and flexibility to support future changes based on VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities and military separation requirements. Although the DBQMA Service is intended to support the performance and management of all disability medical evaluations, it is also expected to optimize and support other disability and separation medical evaluation-related processes, to include: requesting and scheduling examinations, assigning examiners, referring examiners and the referred work between VA, Department of Defense (DoD), Social Security Agency (SSA) and contractors including the contractor billing, and future utilization of the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).  

PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS:  None.

DECLARATION: This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP), government sponsorship of contractor charges against any government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

<DESC>UNCLASSIFIED: Distribution Statement A. Approved for public release.<br><br>Market Survey Questionnaire<br>for<br>Bridge - Light Assault Gap Crossing Capability: Type I<br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<br><br>1.	Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<br><br>2.	In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<br><br>3.	The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.<br><br>4.	Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of <br><br>5.	the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<br><br>6.	In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br><br>7.	The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.<br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br><br>REFERENCE:<br><br>Trilateral Design and Test Code for Military Bridging and Gap-Crossing Equipment can be found at the following website:<br><br>http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA476390&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf<br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:<br><br>1.

<DESC>UNCLASSIFIED: Distribution Statement A. Approved for public release.<br><br>Market Survey Questionnaire<br>for<br>Bridge - Light Assault Gap Crossing Capability: Type II<br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<br><br>1.	Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<br><br>2.	In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<br><br>3.	The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.<br><br>4.	Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<br><br>5.	In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br><br>6.	The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.<br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br><br>REFERENCE:<br><br>Trilateral Design and Test Code for Military Bridging and Gap-Crossing Equipment can be found at the following website:<br><br>http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA476390&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf<br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT:<br><br>1.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Nett Warrior Vehicle GPS Retransmission Systems:<br><br>Project Manager Soldier Warrior, Product Manager Ground Soldier, will field the Nett Warrior (NW) system to Stryker Brigade Combat Teams and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams in FY 2014 through FY 2016. The Nett Warrior system will use an End User Device (EUD) with GPS capabilities to determine Soldier location information. The EUD accompanies Soldiers into military combat vehicles where GPS signals cannot be obtained. To reduce the amount of time for a Soldier's EUD to acquire or reacquire satellites, GPS retransmission inside of the vehicle can provide the EUD a persistent GPS signal.  GPS retransmission is also known as GPS re-radiating or GPS re-radiation.<br><br>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gain knowledge of interest and production capabilities of various contractors to compete and perform a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract. The Government seeks to ensure that there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors. This RFI is for informational purposes only, and is only to be used for the preliminary planning process. Proposals are not being requested or accepted with this synopsis. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this request. A solicitation may or may not be issued as a result of this RFI. No reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information requests.<br><br>Anticipated purchase quantities are 40 in FY 2012, 794 in FY 2013, 851 in FY 2014, and 809 in FY 2015.  Potential military combat vehicles for installation include but are not limited to M2A3 Infantry Fighting Vehicles, M3A3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicles, M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicle, and M1127 Reconnaissance Vehicle.<br><br>Expected capabilities of the GPS retransmission system are:<br>1. The system shall consist of the amplifier and retransmission antenna.<br>2. The system shall have a selectable power level changed by end users to control the vehicle signal coverage area.<br>3. The system shall be capable of being powered from 12 to 32 V DC power from a military combat vehicle.  <br>4. The system shall repeat at a minimum a live L1/L2 signal.<br>5. The system shall be capable of providing power to an active antenna that is mounted outside the vehicle.<br>6. The system will be periodically installed and removed from various types of military combat vehicles and the design shall account for portability and be easily installed in a vehicle.<br>7. Optimally, the system shall work in multiple military combat vehicles without adjustment.  If adjustments are necessary, those adjustments shall not require specialized tools.<br><br>Responses to the RFI should also address the following questions:<br>1. What military combat vehicles have your GPS retransmission systems been installed in?<br>2. What alternative power options are available, for example: solar, battery, or AC power?<br>3. What military specifications and standards does the system conform to from the following (but not limited to):<br> a. MIL-STD-810, Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests<br> b. MIL-STD-461 (CE 102, CE106, RF 102), Requirements for the Control of Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment<br> c. MIL-DTL-5541,  Chemical Conversion Coatings on Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys<br> d. MIL-STD-704, Aircraft Electric Power Characteristics, or MIL-STD-1275, Characteristics of 28 Volt DC Electrical Systems in Military Vehicles<br>4. Based on the anticipated purchase quantities what are approximate system costs?  <br>5. Based on the anticipated purchase quantities what are the approximate delivery timelines? <br><br>To respond to the RFI interested parties can submit a White Paper in electronic format addressing the expected capabilities and include product literature related to the RFI in electronic format.  For email purposes the size of the combined electronic submission shall not exceed five (5) MB.<br><br>This market survey is not a request for competitive proposals. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government will not pay for any effort expended in response to this market survey.  The submitted responses and data will be reviewed by the NW technical team which consists of both Government and embedded support contractor personnel.<br><br>Responses and technical questions should be emailed to Tom Marousek at thomas.j.marousek.civ@mail.mil and Aqua Jefferson at aqua.m.jefferson.civ@mail.mil. All information must be submitted and received no later than 02 February 2012.  <br>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for Small Business Concerns
Walking Box Ranch Construction Project
** This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This is not a Pre-Solicitation Notice. **


Background
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  is seeking interest from qualified Small Business Concernsfor the adaptive reuse/redevelopment of an historic resource known as Walking Box Ranch, as well as the new construction of a small research and learning campus on site.
The ranch is located west of Searchlight, Nevada, just south of Highway 164.  The project involves the sensitive adaptation of the resource to accommodate public visitation while maintaining the historic integrity of the site and structures.   Another separate, yet integral, element of this undertaking is the development of a field research facility to be operated by the University of Nevada  Las Vegas (UNLV) on a portion of the site outside of the designated historic zone.  Interpretive exhibits will be concentrated in areas open to the visiting public.  Utilities and infrastructure will need to be developed.  The development involves 40 acres in the northwest quadrant of a larger 120-acre, protected parcel.  Sensitive treatment of the developed area and methods to control impact upon the adjacent protected areas is part of this undertaking.
The project consists of, but is not limited to, the stabilization, rehabilitation, and preservation of the following (note: all square footages (sf) listed are approximate):&#61656;	Installation of a rock garden to its historic context&#61656;	Selective demolition and the historic preservation of a 5000 sf ranch house&#61656;	The rehabilitation of a 1500 sf existing bunkhouse and the addition of approx. 600 sf to create a new 2100 sf administration building .&#61656;	The preservation of a 2100 sf barn&#61656;	The stabilization of a 120 sf ice house&#61656;	The design completion and fabrication of interior and exterior interpretive exhibits
The project also consists of, but is not limited to, the new construction of (note: all square footages (sf) listed are approximate):&#61656;	Extensive site improvement work (grading, vehicular and pedestrian hardscape, utilities and infrastructure, fencing, tortoise habitat fencing, landscape, etc.) of the 40 acre site&#61656;	A 4300 sf research, classroom, lab facility&#61656;	A 7700 sf bunkhouse with kitchen facility&#61656;	A 300 sf campground pavilion&#61656;	A 1200 sf caretaker residence and garage structure&#61656;	A 900 sf maintenance facility&#61656;	A 120 sf blacksmith shop
This is an educational facility dealing with environmental themes.  It is therefore essential that this undertaking be constructed using sustainable practices.  The project must be registered for certification under a nationally recognized green rating system.  Criteria for evaluating the success of having achieved a sustainable development will be guidance from a rating system such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Globes, or equal.
The attached concept site development plan is for illustration purposes only, and does not necessarily represent the final approved project scope and construction documents.

INFORMATION REQUEST
The Government seeks informed input and questions from interested companies regarding technical requirements and contractual descriptions regarding an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of d-Methamphetamine abuse in urine.  Attachment 1 contains a sample, theoretical Statement of Work (SOW) which details the projected requirements interested responders shall base their submission upon.
  This sample does NOT indicate that the Government will contract for any of the supplies or services discussed within; it is merely a forecast of potential requirements to generate interest and feedback from companies in order to better inform the Government.  Responses will not be rated but will be reviewed as part of an information gathering process.  
The white paper shall address the following two sections:

Section 1 - Technical Requirements
While responding directly to the sample Statement of Work (SOW) within Attachment 1, the white paper shall address the technical requirements based on the SOW provided within the Attachment.  This should be a brief, informal section stating any specific interest, inquiries, capabilities, solutions, expertise, and past experience related to the technical requirements listed in the SOW.
  Comments and suggested revisions to the SOW are also requested.

Section 2 - Questions
Is your company currently producing an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of d-Methamphetamine abuse in urine that is able to meet the requirements based on the Statement of Work provided in the Attachment? 
If not, does your company plan on producing an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of d-Methamphetamine? If so, how long would it take to be able to meet such requirement?
If your company is currently in the process of producing a d-Methamphetamine reagent kit, at what stage of production is the kit at? What is the predicted date of completion?

BACKGROUND
The DOD drug testing program performs testing for a number of drugs of abuse to include both amphetamine and methamphetamine.
  At present the vast majority of the drugs detected in this grouping are amphetamines.  The majority of the amphetamine only tests when reviewed by DOD Medical Review Officers as legitimate use due to a prescription that contains d amphetamine.  In contrast there are a small number of methamphetamine positives.  When the DOD Medical Review Officers review methamphetamine results, the majority of the d-methamphetamine results are found to not have a legitimate prescription.   The DOD drug testing program is interested in seeing if a kit exists that can separate out the positive amphetamines from the positive methamphetamine urines.

<SUBJECT>Capability to Predict Infectious Disease Outbreaks
<SOLNBR>JPM-TMT-12-PREDINFDIS-RFI
<RESPDATE>020612
<CONTACT>Victor E. Cramer, Contracting Officer, Email victor.cramer@dtra.mil
<DESC><strong>Synopsis: <br /></strong>This is a Request for Information. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This notice is published for market research purposes only. This notice is open to qualified business sources of all sizes.
<p>Information is sought regarding the availability and capability of all qualified business sources in providing a bio-defense focused disease outbreak prediction capability that can significantly improve mission planning effectiveness and overall mission assurance by aggregating and correlating remotely sensed data from space- and regionally-based data sources to anticipate and plan for the outbreak of military diseases of interest. This RFI is not soliciting information regarding models or systems that purport to describe the spread - or forecast - of infectious disease once an outbreak has occurred.</p>
<p>Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method for the development of predictive systems for infectious diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Background and Mission: <br /></strong>The Joint Program Management Office - Transformational Medical Technologies (JPM-TMT) Project Office program was established as part of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD). The mission of JPM-TMT is to expedite development and delivery of innovative medical solutions to prepare and protect Warfighters and the Nation against biological warfare agents and emerging infectious diseases. JPM-TMT's Predictive Systems (PS) effort will better prepare and protect the warfighter and the nation by providing a proactive predictive capability to prepare for infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>JPM-TMT is seeking information related to the prediction of infectious disease outbreaks. Anticipating pathogenic theater conditions with more accurate information available earlier than is currently possible, military planners and others will enjoy the opportunity to take better and more timely medical and operational decisions to protect the warfighter, improve medical logistics planning, and mitigate warfighter health risks. Joint Force Mission Assurance is based largely on medical readiness of the warfighter. To ensure maximum military power, commanders must anticipate and plan for the detrimental effects of infectious disease. Determination of infectious disease risk is primarily based on disease prevalence data and historic outbreak reports in the region of interest. However, this information does not fully address disease conditions that the warfighter could experience while in theater.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: <br /></strong>One of JPM-TMT's goals is to enable a proactive capability to counter infectious diseases. This RFI seeks information regarding predictive methods capable of identifying the probability of when and where an outbreak could appear weeks to months prior to disease outbreak. Capabilities for forecasting disease spread after the outbreak will not be considered.</p>
<p>Predictive disease models may integrate numerous variables including, but not limited to, past incidence rates, environmental components, vector ecology, and socioeconomic factors to identify the probability of disease outbreak in a given time and location.</p>
<p>Interested parties should fully describe their infectious disease prediction capability using the following points of interest as a guide:</p>
<p>&bull; How far in advance can an outbreak be predicted?<br />&bull; What is the resolution of the prediction with respect to time and location?<br />&bull; What is the maturity of the capability? Has the model been verified and validated? How, and by whom? <br />&bull; What specific diseases, or classes of diseases, via what disease transmission modes, can be predicted?<br />&bull; For which regions of the world are predictions available?<br />&bull; What data inputs are required to generate a prediction?<br />&bull; What computational infrastructure is required? <br />&bull; What are the requirements to generate a new prediction (e.g., data inputs, time, computational resources)?<br />&bull; What is required to extend the capability to include a new disease and/or location?<br />&bull; Is the capability currently in use? If so, how, where, by whom?<br />&bull; What level of expertise is required operate, interpret and maintain the capability?<br />. <br />Interested parties may include other pertinent information as desired.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:<br /></strong>Disease Prediction - Probability determination that an outbreak will occur<br />Outbreak - Disease incident rate greater than would otherwise be expected at a particular time and location<br />Disease Forecasting - Probability determination of the extent and locations of disease spread after the outbreak</p>
<p><strong>Response Requirements: <br /></strong>Sources having the capability to meet these parameters are invited to respond to this RFI. Responses should be limited to five pages for any given capability, not including the cover page, the cover letter and the table of contents. Any and all information submitted in response to this notice is strictly voluntary and in no way obligates the Government to make a contract award. Submitted data and information will not be returned. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by JPM-TMT from non-government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. For all responses, an additional, non proprietary cover page is also requested, identifying your company name, technical point of contact, and contact information. <br />Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their response, a separate single page statement regarding their capabilities, their DUNS number, and size and type of business.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Instructions: <br /></strong>Respondents should provide responses: (1) using Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF (text searchable format) using single space, 12 point font and 8.5 x 11 size paper; (2) including technical and administrative points of contact, with names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses; and (3) not exceeding five single-sided pages in total (not including cover page and cover letter) sent via email to: robert.huffman@dtra.mil no later than Monday February 6, 2012 at 12:00 PM EST.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer and Important Notes: <br /></strong>The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response hereto. This notice does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation or to award a contract. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. Responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to any solicitation which may be published in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality: <br /></strong>No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Centers (GSFC) Laser and Electro-Optics Branch iscurrently seeking an industry partner to assist with laser amplifier development for theLaser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) program. GSFC is pursuing a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) architecture as the lasertransmitter for the LCRD.  Available matured technologies with a high technologyreadiness level (TRL) that can be applied for the laser power amplifier stages (TRL &gt;4) is required.  The power amplifier stage shall be used in two different communicationmodems for the LCRD.  The two different modems are based on differential phase shiftkeying (DPSK) and pulse position modulation (PPM) formats.  A short description of theLCRD program can be found in a recently released public announcement at websitehttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/lcrd/index.html	 .GSFC seeks specific capability information on erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)technologies for space applications.  This will be used in a capability assessment toassist with preparing possible future NASA-industry partnership opportunities. Initialemphasis will be on a short-term demonstration effort on power scaling.  However, theinformation will also be assessed for a possible longer-term partnership.  The goal ofthis RFI is to ensure that the best and widest possible sets of capabilities areconsidered for immediate applications for the LCRD mission.    Interested organizations are invited to submit a description of their EDFA efforts forspace applications with technical and resource/facility capabilities relevant to our LCRDmission. This submittal should be sent to the NASA point of contact listed below. Itshould also describe the organizations experience and past performance in the areas ofairborne and space-based fiber laser and amplifier development.  GSFC is particularlyinterested in companies that have existing breadboard or hardware that can be readilyused for demonstrating the performance that are close to the above requirements.The fiber amplifier module of interests shall accept input from a Government-furnishedequipment (GFE) master oscillator (MO) via a single mode PM fiber with nominal inputaverage power of ~  0 dBm (and minimum of  -10 dBm).  The fiber amplifier module shallconsist of an optical isolator to protect the MO, pump diodes, active fiber gain medium,WDM combiners, monitor taps with calibrated monitor photodiodes to monitor the modulehealth and performance, and output isolator. Specific information in the following areas is required:1.  Information on previously developed prototypes, breadboards, brass-boards,engineering models or flight EDFAs, which operate in the wavelength band from 1530  1570nm for space applications that meet or exceed the performance requirements given in TableI.2.  Outline steps necessary to demonstrate the performance of the amplifier design perTable 1 on an Engineering Design Unit (EDU) by 9/2012.	The EDU shall meet allperformance requirements under laboratory conditions but not necessarily theenvironmental requirements for space based operation.3.  Outline subsequent steps necessary to upgrade existing breadboards, or the EDU toEngineering Test Units (ETUs) by 12/2013.  Nominally an ETU is a stepping-stone towardflight, and should be designed to have a flight-like configuration, but is not built tofully qualified standards.  4.  Outline subsequent steps necessary for achieving TRL 6 (fully space qualified) on thefiber amplifier module and delivering one flight and one flight spare modules for theDPSK modem and one flight and one flight spare modules for the PPM modem by 12/2015.  5.  Also include any approaches that would meet the requirements of both modulationformats with a single amplifier design.   For this approach, the deliverables would befor two flight and one flight space modules.6.  Information on previous experience with fiber based optical and laser components(e.g. pump laser diodes, damage testing of optical coatings and fiber media, fibersplices integrity, space radiation induced darkening, etc.) and environmental testing andqualification (e.g. vibration, long-term reliability, temperature cycling, acceleratedlife-tests, vacuum) of airborne and/or space-based EDFA.7.  Information on facilities capability that could potentially be applied tomanufacturing the space-qualified EDFA for the LCRD mission.8.  Any published results and/or technical reports on the above (or other relevant)topics, to be included as appendices.Format of Capability Statements & Questions:Capability Statements include an Executive Summary, Main body & appendices, and anyquestions as indicated below.1.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is seeking Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and near COTS systems capable of detecting trace explosives in a maritime environment.  Trace detection should address commercial, military, and home made explosives.
Systems may utilize detection methods such as, but not limited to, colorimetric chemistry, spectroscopy (ion mobility, Mass, infrared, Raman, XRF, terahertz, etc), imaging techniques such hyperspectral imaging, or a combination of several methods of detection. Detection systems should be designed for, or be able to operate in, an outdoor or maritime environment, and/or be otherwise ruggedized or hardened. 

Trace detection technologies are traditionally used for screening personnel and objects at security checkpoints or other locations.
  In some cases, these checkpoints may be located outdoors and/or in harsh environments, such as those experienced while onboard an underway ship or at a pier-side location.  Systems operating in these environments are expected to perform their function (trace explosive detection) effectively and consistently, even in the presence of moisture, temperature fluctuations, salt, and other marine conditions with minimal to no degradation in performance over time.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
EPA?s OSC works with States, Tribes and communities to help them grow in ways that protect the environment, support economic vitality, and create healthy communities. OSC promotes development approaches that have clear environmental benefits, including improved air and water quality, increased wetlands preservation, more clean up and re-use of Brownfield sites, and increased preservation of natural areas. OSC achieves these goals by providing tools and technical assistance that helps States, Tribes and communities make more informed decisions about how and where they want to grow.  Smart growth approaches cover a range of development and conservation strategies that help protect the natural environment, and contribute to community resiliency, economic growth, public health and equitable development. 
As communities look to create jobs, protect the environment, and improve quality of life, they are increasingly adopting land use and development approaches such as directing development to existing communities, supporting more compact and walkable neighborhoods and communities, investing in transportation choices, and cleaning up and reusing brownfields, historic and other vacant properties. These strategies and approaches are often referred to as smart growth approaches. Through technical assistance, OSC seeks to build the capacity of interested Tribal Nations to apply these smart growth approaches to meet community development goals; and to develop models, tools and training materials that helps Tribal communities nationwide utilize smart growth approaches.  
Technical assistance will support application of smart growth approaches to a range of planning and community design activities and help Tribes respond to community concerns such as long term community recovery from disasters and specifically water-related issues including floods, rising groundwater, drought, and water supply; economic development, water infrastructure planning, transportation, and affordable housing. 
Anticipated activities include: + Training: education sessions designed to introduce concepts of planning and smart growth to audiences that are unfamiliar with these concepts and their application to the Tribal context. + Charrette and design workshops: multi-day activities open to the public that help translate the development goals of a community into community design concepts. May focus on one site, neighborhood or community scale, but should result in visual design sketches and concepts. Design sketches could support near term redevelopment of specific buildings or sites, and provide illustrations of desired design that could form the basis of design guidelines, zoning or building codes if desired by the community.  + Policy analysis and development: evaluation and formulation of land use and development policies including but not limited to zoning and building codes; capital investment/facilities planning; stormwater management and water facilities planning; transportation, tax and fiscal policies; and economic development. + Land Suitability Analysis: evaluation of land use suitability of Tribal land for development and/or conservation uses. Suitability analysis should take into account community goals alongside risk and vulnerability assessments for parcels or neighborhoods based on both historic data and future conditions if available and appropriate. This type of suitability analysis can help tribal communities determine areas that are safe and appropriate for growth and direct new development there.  Activities including map making and data gathering may be required to support suitability analysis. PERSONNEL:
Team members will be experts in tribal and community planning, urban design, public participation, disaster recovery, and water facilities planning. Upon completion, the team will provide to interested Tribes land use and policy guidance reports that present options to Tribal communities on land use and development strategies (including capital infrastructure) that support the Tribal goals and values. Where appropriate and desired by the Tribe the final reports may include community designs, site plans, and land use maps. 
It is expected that the following skills will be required to carry out this technical assistance:+ Experience in coordinating and leading a community based Tribal planning effort that results in the development of a land use or master plan or similar document that provides policy guidance on land use and development issues. + Experience developing sustainable approaches to post disaster community recovery.+ Knowledge of smart growth and sustainable community design practices and policies and their application to Tribal communities.  + Knowledge of sustainable and green infrastructure solutions to water and wastewater infrastructure issues.  + Experience evaluating and developing local development regulations such as zoning and building codes, design guidelines, subdivision ordinances. + Experience developing and implementing land use planning information systems for Tribal and/or local governments.  + Experience engaging Tribal governments and residents in the development and implementation of land use planning and sustainable community designs and policies. + Knowledge of and experience with federal housing, health, rural development, transportation and environmental policies and programs and their impact on Tribal development efforts.  
ANTICIPATED TASKS AND DELIVERABLES:
Task 1 -- Site Visit and Smart Growth Training 1a. Develop education and training sessions that introduce, discuss, and explore application of smart growth ideas approaches in long term community recovery from disaster. Training and education sessions shall meet the specific needs of the Tribe, and may include participation of federal agencies involved in supporting Tribe?s long term recovery effort or that could provide further planning assistance following this technical assistance. Representatives from other Tribes that have successfully initiated smart growth and sustainable community efforts may also participate in the training. 
1b. Participate in a multi day site visit to Tribe to tour reservation or tribal lands, gather data and planning and policy documents, meet with community stakeholders and Tribal project team. 
1c. Deliver training developed in Task 1a to Tribal stakeholders and residents. 
Task 2 -- Community Planning Workshop2a. Develop, organize, and deliver community planning workshop (3-4 days) to identify and translate development goals and visions into community design concepts, and begin dialogue about policy options and strategies that could help implement the Tribe?s development vision. 
Task 3 -- Land Use and Planning Strategy3a. Conduct land use suitability analysis to identify areas that are appropriate or suitable for development activity based on the input and guidance of the Tribe.  
3b. Develop land use and planning strategy for Tribe. Components of the strategy could include a discussion of the Tribe?s development vision, development principles and priorities to guide development location, and policy options, strategies, and programming that the Tribe could adopt as public policy to guide future growth and development, including options for development regulations (building code, capital improvements plan, and zoning ordinance).

Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br><br>  a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br>  b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>  c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br><br>  d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?<br><br>  e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?<br><br>  f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br><br>  g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>  h.

This winch was designed and built by Markey Machinery Company, Inc. The period of performance shall start on or about February 6, 2012 in accordance with the ship's schedule and shall take fourteen (14) days to complete. Work shall be preformed aboard the NOAA Ship Nancy Foster, 1050 Register Street, Charleston, SC 29405-2421. The statutory authority is 41 US 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. Markey Machinery has provided/installed the winch on board the NOAA Ship Nancy Foster. The components of the winch are proprietary and require the supervision of Markey Machinery technicians to ensure work is performed in accordance with manufacturer's proprietary technical specifications and guarantee safety, reliability, and prevent inadvertent damage. No other entity can provide the necessary repairs required as required by a Markey Machinery certified technician. Markey Machinery does not have a factory certification or authorized dealership network from which various vendors/dealers can be solicited. Any warranty or performance issues with this system would put the Government at a severe disadvantage if another contractor were to attempt to overhaul the winch without the supervision of a Markey Machinery technical representative. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). The applicable NAICS code is 423830. Interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This is a notice of proposed contract action. It is posted for information purposes only. The Egyptian Personnel Support Services (EPSS) contract provides support for the United States Department of Defense and contractor personnel located in Egypt who are on permanent or temporary duty assignments, performing services under Foreign Military Sales programs on behalf of the Egyptian Air Force. Some of the services include management/maintenance of housing/utilities, furniture/appliances, vehicles, and building/equipment; medical, fire protection, security support, convenience stores, custodial service, grounds maintenance, recreation and dining halls. These services shall be performed in Egypt.
<p>The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) intends to extend the current contract for six (6) months at the rates in effect at the time of the extension. This is a short term effort to bridge the gap between the current contract and the competitive follow-on of the EPSS contract that ends 31 May 2012. The Government plans to award to the incumbent. There is no transition period and the requirement is for full-up support on day one. The unstable political situation has impacted the source selection schedule for the competitive follow-on.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

5.  The Government contemplates an award of a Firm Fixed Priced purchase order contract resulting from this solicitation.
6.  Description of services:  This is a non-personal service contract therefore the offeror must provide project management and supervision of its personnel and liaison to government personnel.  This requirement is for Certified Asbestos Building Inspectors who will be responsible for continuous onsite observation and monitoring of soil and debris removal to ensure no visible emissions will be conducted by both the asbestos abatement contractor and excavating contractor.  Also the offeror will provide air monitoring specialist when needed in accordance with the attached soil characterization and management plan (SCMP, attachment A).  The unit cost shall include all transportation, equipment, and supplies needed to perform the work required, except those items listed in Attachment B.  The estimated completion date is May 30, 2012.  This combined synopsis & solicitation notice is a request for competitive quotations.

7.  The Government will award a single purchase order contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value in terms of past performance and price.  Past performance and price are equal.

Past Performance Information (PPI) will be based on similar contract, and complexity.  The RFQ defines relevant past performance as that which demonstrates the knowledge and experience with observation and monitoring of soil and debris removal.  The size and complexity of the project is described on page 2 thru 4 of the SCMP.  The Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant in size and scope to the effort described in the RFQ.  Experience with projects of this size, type and complexity is considered vitally important.  More recent PPI will be given greater consideration.  A questionnaire will be sent to the point of contact on the "General Contractor Reference Form".  General Contractor Reference Forms are required at offer submittal.  The point of contact on the "General Contractor Reference Form" is required to return the questionnaire directly to the contracting officer.  Any questionnaire returned by an offeror will not be considered for evaluation.  In the event an offeror has no questionnaire(s) that offerors shall receive a rating that is neither favorable nor unfavorable.  In addition, other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), and commercial sources may be used for further information.  The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the acquisition.

Price: The following items will be considered the price evaluation:

	1. Completeness. All price information required by the RFQ has been submitted.
	2. Reasonableness. The Government will review the prices for accuracy and reasonableness.
3. Price Information: The Contracting Officer will utilize the past performance ratings and price evaluations in preparing its overall rating of the proposals and as to the Best Value determination for selection of successful offeror.

In the event the Government has reason to question the reasonableness of a price proposal the Government may conduct such additional reasonable analysis as it requires in order to complete a thorough price analysis. Because the evaluation of the price proposal will represent a portion of the total evaluation, it is possible that an offeror may not be selected because of an unbalanced, unreasonable price proposal.

8.  Offerors must submit representations and certifications in accordance with the provision at FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Item.  (Accessible at the FAR Site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil)

9.  Submit the following documents in response to this RFQ:

     a. Price Quotation (Attachment B)  

     b. Past Performance (Attachment C)

10.	Offers are due on January 27, 2012 1:00 PM MST.  All questions/inquiries must be submitted to the contract officer via electronic mail (e-mail) not later than 11:00 AM MST on January 25, 2012.  Inquiries submitted via telephone calls will be re-directed to an e-mail submission.  Submit offers or any questions to the attention of Thaddeus Willoughby via email to Thaddeus.willoughby@va.gov .  Offerors who fail to complete and submit the requirements above may be considered non-responsive.

<p>THIS IS NOT A SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE. ONLY PRICE PREFERENCE WILL BE GIVEN TO SMALL BUSINESS</p>
We don't expect to get a special melt. We do want to check for micro alloying elements however to make sure that the steel meets our requirement (or is very close to it). We have check some production 9310 steels and find that some of the 9310 steels being produced meet our requirements (but the steel makers don't check these elements). We want to use a 9310 composition that is a commercial product. However, we think that setting requirements for micro alloy elements is needed to reduce variability in our product. We have purchased some 9310 round bar off-the-shelf from 3 different suppliers to do initial studies. Our next step here is to get a slightly larger quantity, rolled square, and start to establish compositional requirements.

<DESC>Below are questions asked about the SOW and the answers to these questions:
<p>1. In the Statement of Work, section 5, there is a varying number of web sites to monitor, quality of NLM streaming media, and hardware appliances required. Since this is a fixed price proposal, how do we reconcile a fixed price with a varying number of items? Our pricing is based upon each of these items being known/fixed. For pricing purposes, should we provide a minimum cost for the minimum number of each item, as well as a maximum cost for the maximum of each item, or can you propose a different alternative?</p>
<p>The statement of work specifies the number of initial quantities for each of our requirements.</p>
<p>2. Will the offerer or NLM be responsible for setting up the appliances at each location?</p>
<p>Hardware appliances will be installed by NLM. They should be built and configured before being shipped. Not all locations allow for remote access.</p>
<p>3. Should the offerer propose a travel budget or can the government propose a reasonable Other Direct Costs amount that would cover any travel costs? If the offerer needs to propose a travel budget, please provide a list of each location where the appliances will be installed as well as any other locations where we would need to travel (as well as the number of times).</p>
<p>There should not be any required travel costs involved. Appliances will be shipped to location and installed by the government.</p>
<p>4. Who will setup the network monitoring services - the offerer or the government?<br />The government should have the ability to configure which applications will be monitored (based on the contracted number of health checks).</p>
<p>5. Is there any requirement to train government staff in using any of the items listed in the RFP?</p>
<p>Initial training should be offered to the government to assist in setting up the required scripts.</p>
<p>6. How many applications are on each server that in each location will be monitored by the appliances? Are they in the same or different locations as the appliances will be installed?</p>
<p>Each appliance will monitor the same applications. Once a script is configured it should be applied to all appliances.</p>
<p>7. Please identify the media file types and desired media player formats that are desired for testing.</p>
<p>To support future applications, they should be able to support various formats that can accommodate public users.</p>
<p>8. The Government has requested that "a real embedded Internet Explorer Browser with caching simulate a real world scenario of a user returning to a monitored site". With actual usage demonstrating that approximately 99% of the users are new users and given the added cost and complexity to satisfy the requirement for 1% of the returning user population, is the requirement for a returning user an absolute requirement?</p>
<p>We need to be able to demonstrate new users as well as returning users and their environment.</p>
<p>9. Will the Government furnish network access at the Government Place of Performance in order access the internet?</p>
<p>Yes, for private checks we will be providing the internet connections at various locations.</p>
<p>10. Will the Government require testing different facets of the web site or is testing the home page only acceptable?</p>
<p>This should be controlled by the government to accommodate various applications embedded within various web applications.</p>
<p>11. Will the Government please identify the specified threshold for webpage download times?</p>
<p>Thresholds various based on business requirements and should be controlled by the government through user controls (I.e. Web access to make changes to checks).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Proposals will be evaluated by a committee of technically qualified NOAA employees assisted by bureau contracting personnel in accordance with the criteria below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>A.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor 1 &ndash; Technical Capabilities</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">1. Criterion 1 - Adequacy of Response.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror&rsquo;s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">2. Criterion 2 - Feasibility of Approach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. <strong><em>{An assessment of the degree of confidence provided by the proposed verification</em></strong> <strong><em>approaches/methods will also be included.} </em></strong>In the event that enhancements are proposed, the enhancements will be evaluated to determine whether the approach taken is feasible and will result in an end product/service that fully meets or exceeds the RFP requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>B.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor 2 &ndash; Performance Risk Evaluation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>The Performance Risk evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Stated experiment encompasses the accomplishment of work by the proposer which is comparable or related to the effort required under this procurement. Past performance indicate how well the proposer did on the earlier work. (At a minimum, the contactor should list/demonstrate their experience in working with the U.S. Government in presentations at meetings/ conferences for groups of similar size to ours over the last three years.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span><span>C.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Factor 3 &ndash; Cost/Price</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Cost/Price factors are those factors, which indicate the adequacy and realism of the cost proposal and the probable cost that will be incurred should the Government choose to contract with the proposer. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>The evaluation of cost factors will include an assessment of the probable cost of doing business with each proposer during the course of the contract. It will also include a comparison with commercial industry estimate of the cost. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Cost will not be the deciding factor when proposals are ranked in the technically acceptable range. Technical and Past Performance combined will carry more weight than Cost. </span></p>

<p>5) The Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure shall consist of one CLIN for labor categories/hours and one CLIN for travel in the base period and three (3) option periods of a firm fixed priced Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. See Enclosure (4)</p>
<p>6) The US Coast Guard intends to enter into a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract with a base year and three one-year options.

<p>8) Basis for Award: The IDIQ firm fixed priced contract award will be made to the offeror conforming to the RFP that represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price criteria considered. Vendors shall note that the Government is more concerned with strengths in the non-price criteria than making an award to the lowest overall price. The basis for award will be best value, which will be based on consideration of the following evaluation criteria: (1) Technical Capability (2) Relevant Past Performance, and (3) Price. Technical is more important than relevant past performance and when combined are more important than price. Further, as the technical evaluation of the offerors become closer in ratings, price becomes more important in determining the best value. In the event that two (2) or more offers are determined not to have any substantial non-price criteria differences award may be made to the lower priced offeror. It shall be noted that award may be made to other than the lower priced offeror if the Government determines paying a higher price is the best value. In either case, a tradeoff will be conducted. The Government reserves such right of flexibility in conducting the evaluation as necessary to assure an award with the contractor providing the best value to the Government. The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>

<p>10) The Provision at 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: technical capability; relevant past performance; price.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability - The Government will evaluate the offeror's capability to perform the tasks described in IDIQ Performance Work Statement (PWS). Note that simply restating the PWS requirements is insufficient. The vendor's response to the PWS requirements should demonstrate a sound, thorough and viable technical approach that specifically addresses all aspects of the PWS clearly and convincingly demonstrating subject matter expertise, understanding of the requirement, and knowledge of the USCG environment. Vendors shall provide the planned technical approach that will be utilized to accomplish all the tasks in the attached PWS (See Enclosure 1). The Government will evaluate resumes of key personnel and the proposed labor mix for how they support the offeror's technical capability.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Relevant Past Performance - To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years and the total dollar value must exceed $100,000.00. The offeror is solely responsible for ensuring the Questionnaire is completed and returned by the respective references to the email address (Keith.Harding@uscg.mil) on or before the proposal deadline (Thursday, January 26, 2012 at 11:00 AM, EST). Past performance will be evaluated on quality of service, timeliness of performance and business relations. The Government reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information received via proposals or questionnaires. A vendor's lack of relevant past performance information will be evaluated by the Government as "Neutral" for this factor.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price - The Government will evaluate each of the four (4) separate periods of performance (base and 3 options) in the offeror's price proposal for the IDIQ contract. Labor rates will be evaluated individually to determine if they are fair and reasonable. However, price alone will not be the determining factor.</p>
<p>The factors listed above are in descending order of importance. Technical and past performance when combined, are more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>11) Offeror shall provide a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer; OR verify that information required by this provision is listed on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website located at https://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS UNITED STATES COAST GUARD OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>The Landing Gear Supply Chain Management office anticipates issuing a contract for the repair/overhaul of approximately 275 landing gear components associated with the C-130 (all models), KC-135A/R, and E-3 (all models).</p>
<p>This contract will initially encompass all three aircraft weapon systems; however, the Air Force may decide to reduce or eliminate the requirement for contract repair on one or more weapon systems at its discretion.<br /><br />Landing Gear Component Repair is a major depot-level repair program for the USAF.

However, interested parties may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

<DESC><br>This is a revised Synopsis to change the procurement strategy from unrestricted to a 100% small business set-aside.  The scope of work establishes requirements for services pertaining to the monitoring, sampling, data analysis, and data collaboration of groundwater wells at the Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) Open Burning (OB) and Open Detonation (OD) areas. Waste Military Munitions are destroyed by burning and underground detonation at the OB and OD areas. There are currently eight groundwater wells to be monitored on a semiannual basis, all of which are currently in ANAD's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit. Additional wells may also be monitored for groundwater water elevations based on the requirements of state environmental regulators. A statistical evaluation will be completed to determine if statistically significant evidence of contamination above background levels at each monitoring well exist within 45 calendar days after completion of each sampling event. If statistically significant evidence of contamination exist above background levels sampling of Appendix IX to part 264 of 40 CFR compounds will be required in addition. Annual groundwater reports are also required within this scope. This scope includes the above monitoring activities and any other groundwater activities that may result from the site's continued operation based on ANAD's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit and state/federal environmental regulations. This solicitation is for a base and four one year options. This procurement set-aside 100% for Small Business. North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380. This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501, 5.102(a)(7) and 14.205-1(c); therefore hard copies will not be provided. Proposals submitted must be in electronic format as stated in the solicitation. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ (Army Single Face to Industry). Estimated issue date is 1 February 2012. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact, unable to maintain a bidder's mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of your proposal.

<DESC>Synopsis:<br><br>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by PEO, EIS, Technology Applications Office in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. PEO, EIS, Technology Applications Office is requesting industry comment on its ability to provide non-developmental, multi-functional devices with the maximum number of attributes as described below. Those not able to provide all preferred features are still encouraged to submit information on the features currently available in their products and propose an applicable schedule, for those features that are planned for the future. <br><br>The intent of this RFI is to understand what products are or will be available in the High Definition (HD) video encoder market in a small form factor suitable for installation in space limited or mobile locations. As video source systems become more complex and user needs and capabilities become more disparate, there is a need to develop network centric and convenient means to meet different objectives. An HD video encoder offers a partial solution to the problem. In the example below, a typical encoder scenario is described. <br><br>An HD video encoder ingests an HD-SDI raw video stream from an HD video sensor. The HD-SDI video stream carries a 1280x720p, 30fps video signal with MISB STD 0601-compliant KLV metadata embedded in the VANC. No audio is present. The encoder produces two UDP multicast MPEG-2 TS streams each comprising an H.264 and KLV elementary stream. One MPEG-2 TS stream contains 720x480p, 30fps video at 1.3 Mbps and the other contains 1280x720p, 30fps video at 6 Mbps. Each stream contains the same KLV metadata elementary stream, and other MPEG-2 TS control signals. Latency due to the encode process is less than 250ms. Loss of video interpretability or intelligence is no greater than one V-NIIRS level at the lower rate encoded stream. The video content will include scenarios such as areas of interest loitering, dismounts, and vehicle tracking. <br><br>Interested parties shall respond, and describe existing or near-term mature (next 30 days) capabilities, estimated costs, features or products that meet or exceed those in the aforementioned scenario. Respondents are encouraged to describe additional features and capabilities supported by their solutions. A written response shall address which of the following list of capabilities are supported and describe the vendor's approach, support, and limitations for these capabilities and any unique or special variations or extensions to these capabilities. <br><br>1) Interfaces<br>a) Video: <br>i) Composite (NSTC/PAL) (Threshold)<br>ii) SD-SDI (SMPTE 259M) (T)<br>iii) HD-SDI (SMPTE 292M) (T)<br>iv) 3G-SDI (SMPTE 424M) (T)<br>v) HDMI (O)<br>vi) ASI (O)<br>vii) 1 Input (T)/2 Inputs (Objective)<br>b) Serial Data <br>i) RJ-45 RS-232 Serial for Cursor on Target (CoT) or KLV metadata<br>ii) RJ-45 RS-232 Serial for Management<br>iii) Number of Interfaces: 1 (T)/2 (O)<br>c) Ethernet<br>i) RJ-45 10/100/1000 Mbps Base-T for streaming<br>ii) RJ-45 10/100/1000 Mbps Base-T for management<br>iii) Autodect/Half/Full Duplex<br>d) Power<br>i) With locking interface<br>2) Video Encoding<br>a) H.264 (ISO/IEC 14496-10 AVC MPEG-4 part 10)<br>i) Baseline Profile<br>ii) Main Profile<br>b) GOP: 1 - 300, infinite<br>c) Frame Rate: 10 - 60 fps (T)/1 - 60 fps (O)<br>d) Video Resolutions<br>i) Input<br>(1) 720x480i 59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(2) 720x576i 50Hz<br>(3) 720x480p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(4) 720x576p 25Hz/50Hz<br>(5) 1280x720p 29.97Hz/30Hz/50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(6) 1920x1080i 50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(7) 1920x1080p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz/50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>ii) Output<br>(1) 352x240p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(2) 360x262p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(3) 360x480p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(4) 360x576p 25Hz<br>(5) 720x480i/ 59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(6) 720x576i 50Hz<br>(7) 720x480p 24Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz<br>(8) 720x576p 25Hz<br>(9) 1280x720p 29.97Hz/30Hz/50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(10) 1920x1080i 50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>(11) 1920x1080p 24 Hz/23.98Hz/30Hz/29.97Hz/50Hz/59.94Hz/60Hz<br>iii) Conversion<br>(1) 720p 260x262p<br>(2) 720p 360x480p<br>(3) 720p 720x480p<br>(4) 1080p 720x 480p<br>(5) 1080p 720p<br>e) Bit Rate: 100 kbps - 20 Mbps <br>f) Bit Rate Regulation: ABR (T)/CBR, VBR (O)<br>g) Quantization Floor Adjustment: 6 - 52<br>h) Input/Output <br>i) 1 input to 2 independent output streams (T)<br>ii) 2 inputs each to 2 independent output streams (O)<br>i) Latency: <br>i) < 250 ms @ 24 - 30 fps<br>ii) <150 ms @ 50 - 60 fps<br>3) Metadata Input<br>a) Encoding: CoT, KLV (MISB Compliant)<br>b) Transport Protocols:<br>i) CoT: Serial (RS-232), IP<br>ii) KLV: Serial (RS-232), IP, VANC<br>c) CoT to KLV conversion (O) <br>4) Network Protocols<br>a) Streaming<br>i) MPEG-2 Transport Stream (SPTS) ISO\IEC 13818<br>(1) 1 - 7 TS packets/IP packet<br>(2) Adjustable MTU size<br>ii) UDP, RTP, Multicast, Unicast<br>iii) Channel announcement via SAP<br>b) Access: UDP, RTP, IGMP, SNMP, HTTP<br>5) Management<br>a) Command/Telnet (T)<br>b) Web Browser GUI (O)<br>c) Logging<br>d) Status Indicators<br>6) Physical<br>a) Size: < One quarter of standard 1 RU 19" Rack space<br>b) Power: 100-240 VAC, < 20W<br>c) Weight: < 5 lbs<br>7) Environmental<br>a) Operating Temperature: 0 - 70 C<br>b) Relative Humidity: 5% - 95%<br>c) EMC: FCC part 15 class B and CE<br>8) Security: AES 256/128 bit encryption (O)<br>This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).

GENERAL/SCOPE.<br><br>The US Army Medical Department Center and School G/6 (AMEDDC&S G/6)   requires a Contractor to provide subject matter experts capable of conducting research, defining mobility requirements, recommending solution architecture, developing a strategy /plan to standup enterprise mobile app development environment and to develop an implementation strategy that will protect the AMEDDC&S from the security risks mobility presents and meets the DOD security requirements.  <br><br><br>1.1.

The Strategy Plans, and Policy Division develops policies and strategies to achieve long-term objectives, conducts portfolio management, and information assurance management functions.  The Business Technology Solutions Division conducts requirements analysis, software development, software management, and configuration management.  The Operations Management Division provides customer support services, serves as liaison between FSH NEC and AMEDDC&S users, and provides audio visual and video teleconferencing services for AMEDDC&S.  <br><br>Providing on-demand training and education products necessitate that AMEDDC&S G-6 explore how to organize, integrate, and implement mobile applications into the Army Medical Department Center and School (AMEDDC&S) training environment.  AMEDDC&S is a target-rich environment for both training and education apps as well as business apps supporting medical staff, faculty, and students.  Many factors need to be researched to enable C&S leadership to make informed business decisions regarding uses of mobile applications.  Some of these factors include obtaining an understanding of where the industry is headed (networks, development tools, architecture, devices), DOD and Army guidance and direction, and our customer expectations and mobile usage habits.  Successful consulting support through this initiative will provide a strategy to deliver on-demand training and education apps and business apps to AMEDDC&S staff, faculty, and students and the Army Medical community as a whole that fits in the architecture plans of the MEDCOM.  <br><br>1.2 OBJECTIVE.<br><br>The objective is to award a single FFP commercial services contract award to perform the services as described.

This includes dissemination of protocols and papers not generally available through the public literature.<br>1.6.2.3. The Government anticipates that the work to be performed under this contract will involve access to sensitive but unclassified materials (otherwise known as "Limited Official Use") and non-sensitive materials. Sensitive materials may include, but are not limited to: all "individually identifiable health information" held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule calls this information "protected health information (PHI) that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual.13  Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number). <br>" Individually identifiable health information  is information including demographic data, that relates to: 1) the individual's past, present or future physical or mental health or  condition, 2) the provision of health care to the individual or 3) the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual."	<br>1.6.2.4.

The contractor shall also comply with federal laws relating to freedom of information and records management.<br><br>1.6.2.6. Personnel Security Requirements. The following standards designate positions requiring access to IT and for processing information within IT systems. These security designations are required to distinguish potential adverse effects on Army functions and operations and, therefore, the relative sensitivity of functions performed by individuals having certain privileges. These positions are referred to as IT and IT-related positions. The requirements of this section will be applied to all IT and IT-related positions for contractor personnel, or others affiliated with the DoD. Additional guidance is available in DoD 5200.2-R.    The COR, in consultation with the AMEDDS&C Security Officer, will determine the appropriate risk level for each Contractor employee position.<br><br>1.6.2.7.   Contractor employees must obtain a favorable FBI Background check and a NACI investigation must be initiated prior to commencement of work.  A favorable FBI background check will allow for interim approval to receive a CAC card and commence performance.  However, in the event the NACI results in unfavorable findings the AMEDDS&C security office will initiate a preliminary suitability determination for further review.  In the interim the contactor employees CAC access will be revoked until a final suitability determination is made.  The KO will notify the contractor of the results of the final suitability determination findings and in the event the findings are unfavorable the contractor shall take immediate action to remove the employee.  <br>1.6.2.8. Required Security Forms<br>The following forms must be completed and submitted by the Contractor for each Contractor background investigation:<br>1.	FD-258 (Applicant Fingerprint Card) - (two sets per applicant)<br>2.	SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) OR SF-85 P (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions) <br>1.6.2.9. Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigation<br>The Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigation duties for all persons proposed for work under this contract:<br>     1.  Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in paragraph D above and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. <br>     2.   Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints and approved by the COR and AMEDDS&C  Security Officer.<br>    3.   Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness. Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.<br>    4.   Submit completed forms to the COR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after contract award.<br>1.6.2.10. The COR will provide the Contractor an adequate supply of forms and instructions for completing the forms within three (3) calendar days after contract award.<br>1.6.2.11. The COR will receive from the Contractor all completed security forms. The COR will coordinate with his/her AMEDDS&C Security Officer and ensure that these forms are forwarded to the appropriate investigating agency in accordance with appropriate internal procedures. The investigating agency will conduct the requisite investigations.<br>1.6.2.12. The investigating agency will furnish the COR or AMEDDS&C Security Officer, as appropriate, the results of each proposed Contractor employee's investigation through issuance of a Certificate of Investigation (COI). Upon receipt of the COI and any other pertinent documents from the investigating agency, the COR or AMEDDS&C  Security Officer as appropriate, will determine whether or not each proposed Contractor employee should be granted employment security approval. This decision process is called "adjudication" and will be performed in accordance with current AMEDDS&C adjudicative guidelines. The COR or AMEDDS&C Security Officer, as appropriate, will notify, if required, the investigating agency of the adjudicative determination of each investigation. If OPM is the investigating agency, this will be accomplished by the COR or AMEDDS&C  Security Officer, as appropriate, completing and submitting to OPM an INV Form 79A, "Report of Agency Adjudicative Action." The COR must be provided a copy of each COI and INV Form 79A as they become available. Inasmuch as the AMEDDS&C Security Office monitors and has oversight responsibility for the AMEDDS&C Contractor Personnel Security Program, the COR and/or the AMEDDS&C Security Officer should consult the DSO when confronted with questionable adjudicative determinations.<br>1.6.2.13. The COR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated. The KO will notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment security approval so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.<br>1.6.2.14. The COR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals. Upon receipt of this information and any other information which may be required elsewhere in the contract, the Contracting Officer will issue individual task orders to the Contractor which permits the commencement of work under the contract.<br>1.6.2.15. The COR will maintain an up-to-date file of COI's and other background investigation-related documentation for all Contractor employees throughout the life of the contract. <br>1.6.2.16. Re-Investigation of Contractor Employees<br>Security investigations are very costly to the Government. The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing, shall assure that otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least 365 calendar days. The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure that Contractor or Subcontractor personnel who are selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein. <br>The fact that the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to assure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character. Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated its responsibilities to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should there be need to replace a Contractor or subcontractor employee due to nonperformance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated its responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees. <br>1.6.2.17.. Neither the Contractor nor any of its contract service providers shall disclose or cause to disseminate any information concerning operations of military activities.  Such action(s) could result in violation of the contract and possible legal actions.<br><br>1.6.2.18. All inquiries, comments or complaints arising from any matter observed, experienced, or learned of as a result of or in connection with the performance of this contract, the resolution of which may require the dissemination of official information, shall be directed to the  COR and the KO.<br><br>1.6.2.19.. The Contractor shall only conduct business with designated government personnel listed as COR or ACOR.  Names of authorized personnel shall be provided to the Contractor by the government, in writing, and updated as necessary throughout the contract period.<br><br>1.6.2.20.. U.S. Government records, copies of original results and reports, verified original data, corrected data, and corrected supporting final reports are maintained by the Contractor, but remain the property of the U.S. Government.  These files/results must be surrendered to the COR.<br><br>1.6.2.21. Installation Passes.  <br><br>The COR will coordinate the issuance of required installation passes to Contractor personnel, if applicable.  Contract personnel shall wear a badge that clearly identifies them as a contract employee.  The badge will contain a personal picture, name of employee, and Contractor's name.  Badges shall be worn on the outer garment in full view at all times, attached to the outer shirt or jacket pocket by a button or clip or worn around the neck secured by an appropriate identification card lanyard.<br><br>1.6.2.22. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and ensure performance is secure while protecting material, equipment, and supplies from damage and loss.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories.  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.
Scope of Effort:  This Screening Information Request/Request  for Offer (SIR) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the Eastern Service Area.  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code  to this effort is 561612 Security Guard and Patrol Services with the size standard of $18.5 Million.
In order to provide opportunities for the small businesses and to ensure the FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:
I.	8(a) CompaniesII.	SDVOSBIII.	Small BusinessesIV.	Large Businesses
(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.  
As part of the FAA Small Business Conference, a briefing was presented on July 18, 2011 that provided attendees an overview of the program contract strategy for the National Security Officer Program.  This briefing is also attached to this announcement.
Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Robert C. Taylor II, Contract Specialist, at robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov.no later than 2:00 p.m., January 5, 2012.  Questions and responses that clarify the SIR may be provided to all Offerors; however the source of the questions will not be identified.  
The FAA plans to publish responses to questions on February 1, 2012, and host a teleconference with interested parties on February 2, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Due to the limited availability of dial in access lines, interested parties are requested to limit representation to one dial in access per company. 
Teleconference details are as follows:Dial In: 202-493-4180  Passcode: 8176The dial in information remains the same as originally stated in the SIR.
Please be advised, Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, and J.3, Facility Post Exhibits, are being distributed in a generic format.  Due to the sensitivity of the site specific information associated with Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, Sensitive Unclassified Information (SUI) will be released to the awardee.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) in regards to a NAVAIR requirement for providing a cylindrical grinder to be used in the manufacturing of components for U.S. Navy applications. NAVAIR Lakehurst, NJ seeks potential sources and no cost product information of commercially available new cylindrical grinder. This RFI is for planning purposes and information only and should not be construed as a solicitation for applications or an obligation on the part of the government.
<p>Background<br />A commercially available model is defined as the Contractor's model which, on the date this solicitation is issued, has been designed, engineered, sold, or is being offered for sale through advertisements or the Contractor's published catalogue or brochures. Products such as a prototype unit, pre-production model, or experimental unit do not qualify as meeting the requirements specified herein. However, the Government will consider changes to an existing commercially available product design that may improve the efficiency, accuracy, or productivity of the machine or decrease its operational costs. <br />In order to expand shop capability, NAVAIR Lakehurst has a requirement for a cylindrical grinder with the following specifications:</p>
<p>The cylindrical grinder shall be used for both overhauling used launch valve plugs and manufacturing new valve plugs for the Navy. These launch valve plugs are manufactured with a welded hard face seat surface of hardness up to 48 on the Rockwell C Scale. The grinder will be used to remove the old seat surface from used valve plugs as well as the rough and finish grinding on the seat surface for new and repaired plugs. These processes are currently performed using a 30" diameter, 2" wide grinding wheel, Norton #23AG4M5VBE.</p>
<p>We require a new cylindrical grinder with all options and accessories needed to complete the plug grinding processes. The grinder shall be a new commercially available model. A commercially available model is defined as the Contractor's model which, on the date this RFI is issued, has been designed, engineered, sold, or is being offered for sale through advertisements or the Contractor's published catalogue or brochures. Products such as a prototype unit, pre-production model, or experimental unit do not qualify as meeting the requirements herein. However the Government will consider changes to an existing commercially available product design that may improve the efficiency, accuracy, or productivity of the machine or decrease its operational costs.</p>
<p>The machine shall be capable of machining a tapered surface at a nominal angle of 7.125 degrees from the plug centerline. The actual angle must be adjustable to produce zero clearance at assembly. The machine shall have a 20" swing, 50" between centers, and a work piece weight capacity of 1400lbs. The work head shall have a chuck capable of accepting a 3" diameter part end. The tailstock shall have a live 4 jaw chuck capable of chucking on the inside diameter of a 4"diameter by 2.5" deep bore. The tailstock shall also have the capability of using a live center for parts that do not have the 4" diameter bore. The machine shall be capable of producing a surface finish of 62 micro inches or better. The machine may have either manual or CNC control.</p>
<p>Information Requested<br />Information in the following areas will assist NAVAIR Lakehurst in the development of its procurement strategy. Qualified vendors should provide the following: <br />Product Literature: Brochures, catalogs, or other documents listing commercially available new cylindrical grinder;</p>
<p>Product Literature on the software being provided with the equipment</p>

<DESC>This is the BPA award resulting from the October 2010 Onramp. NASA is providing services through BPAs to gain access to a variety of airborne platforms, with proven performance histories to conduct airborne science research. These aircraft platforms are to accommodate light and heavy-lift instrumentation payloads, on fixed wing and lighter-than-air platforms. Both manned and unmanned aerial platform access is available under the BPAs. The instrumentation payload(s) will be provided by the U.S. Government or by non-U.S. Government customers. Additional services of engineering, fabrication, and installation may be needed depending on the payload.The catalog of platforms is managed by the Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility (GSFC's WFF), though the missions are conducted at various locations within and occasionally outside the United States.
