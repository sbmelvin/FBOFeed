<ARCHDATE>08042007
<CONTACT>TANGEE BROOKIE PURCHASING AGENT 3032369322     tbrookie@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, Energy Team, has a requirement for a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD System (goniometer positioning system).  The goniometer positioning system must be direct optical encoding.  The ability to move the tube and detector arm to discrete angular positions must not be affected by any wear or backlash in the gear train that exists between the drive motor and tube/detector arms.  The position of the tube and detector arm shall be read by an optical reader, which looks for the position of an optically encoded disc, which is mounted directly on the tube and detector arms.  DC motors, which are tied to the optical encoders with a feedback loop, shall continuously monitor the position of the optical discs, ensuring the correct theta/theta positions are achieved and constantly maintained.  Should the operator bump the tube or detector arm, momentarily changing its position, the system shall automatically reposition the tube and/or detector arm to the previously set position.  The solid state, linear array, position sensitive detector, otherwise known as the X'Celerator detector, shall be simultaneously mounted on the detector arm, along with a video camera.  The video camera shall be used for sample alignment purposes.  With the video camera and X'Celerator mounted on the detector arm, it shall be possible to collect diffraction data from 0.5 degrees to 161 degrees 2theta, in under 8 minutes, while measuring a FWHM of no greater than 0.29 FWHM for certain peaks on a LaB6 NIST standard.  Starting with the system running and being fully operational, it must be possible on a routine basis to turn off the instrument, rotate the x-ray tube from line to point focus (or vise versa) without disconnecting any water lines, turn the power back on, switch from line to point focus optics (or vise versa), and be fully operational again, all within 15 minutes, with no system realignment required.  This is necessary to switch from general power diffraction to X-Y mapping of rock slab samples.  Starting with the system running and being fully operational with a sample rotation stage and sample changer in place, it must be possible to replace the sample rotation stage and changer with a X-Y-Z-chi-phi positioning stage and be fully operational again, all within 10 minutes, with no system realignment required.  It must be possible to roll the sample changer to the side of the enclosure and park it in a holding position until it is needed again.  Interlocks within the enclosure shall confirm the sample changer is properly parked for operator safety pruposes.  To ensure the future needs of the lab will be met, it must be possible to install a diffracted beam monochromator on the linear array solid state (X'Celerator) detector.  This diffracted beam monochromator must be a commercially available product from the XRD vendor supplying the system.  The linear array detector and associated diffracted beam monochromator must have been available for sale from the XRD vendor for a minimum of 1 year.  Installation shall include a minimum of 2 days of on-sight training.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the system specified as a sole source from PANanalytical Inc., 22016 Broken Bow Dr., Lake Forest, CA 92630, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required system or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Afghanistan Procurement Support Office in Bangkok, Thailand, and in conjunction with the USAID Mission in Kabul, Afghanistan intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for USAID/Afghanistan to solicit proposals from qualified organizations/institutions interested in implementing the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Development Activity.     Critical to the success of this program is maintaining a focus on enabling, rather than directing, the growth of the private sector.
 
The primary goal of this program is to increase the contribution of the private sector to economic growth in a minimum of four provinces including: Badakhshan, Nangarhar, Helmand and Heart, with the following objectives:  

1. Expand markets, increase access to information, and lower transaction costs.
2. Develop the workforce through technical, trade, accounting, and managerial training.
3. Create jobs through growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.
4. Promote domestic and foreign investment.
5. Compete internationally where Afghanistan has, or potentially has, a comparative advantage.
6. Develop Afghan domestic markets and improve productivity to help local products become competitive with imports.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this solicitation is 935. As such, this procurement is open to all offers from USAID Geographic Code (Source, Origin and Nationality) 935 which include all countries, except for those designated by the US Government as foreign policy restricted countries. The current foreign policy restricted countries are as follows: Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. USAID also encourages the use of the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the Federal Business Opportunities website page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.

USAID anticipates awarding a single award Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract.  The period of performance will be 3 years with two one year options. The RFP is expected to be issued on March 14, 2006 and proposals will be due no later than the closing date specified in the RFP.  Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued on the website along with the RFP. Please check the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) periodically.

Any questions should be submitted via email to the point of contact at: apsobangkok@usaid.gov.

Please do not contact USAID/Afghanistan in Kabul directly, since all communication must be through this office.  The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>Description  

General:
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, is seeking contractor(s) to provide services for the collection of rangeland data on selected sample sites (points) for the National Resources Inventory (NRI), Rangeland Field Study in Nebraska. The intent of the Agency is to solicit the most efficient and effective manner to complete the requirements of this inventory. The performance period is estimated to begin September, 2006 and ends September 30, 2007. The contract may include options for future years. The guaranteed minimum task order for the base year only is $2,000. The maximum amount for this contract (base year and all  option years) is estimated to be $1,000,000.

Background:
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is mandated (through the Rural Development Act of 1972, the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977, and other supporting legislation) to assess the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources on the Nations non-Federal lands.  Resources inventory legislative authorities, NRCS policy, and responsibilities for conducting the NRI are contained in NRCS General Manual 290, Part 400.

Objective/Scope:
The objective of this solicitation is to acquire specified rangeland inventory data on two data points in each of about (160) 160-acre Primary Sample Units (PSU) (up to 320 total data points) located in several Nebraska counties. 
General Rangeland Inventory Data Elements:
The following categories characterize general data collection needs:
(a) GPS navigation to points and point position capture; (b) ownership; (c)land cover/use; (d) landscape and soils; (e) ecological site information;(f) rangeland health indicators; (g) noxious weeds and invasive/alien plants; (h) disturbance indicators; (i) conservation practices and resource concerns; (j) line point transects for cover composition; (k) line intercept transects for basal and canopy gaps; (l) cover density and height (Robel Pole); and (m) species composition by weight, production and Similarity Index (SI).

Data Collection:
Government Provided Equipment. All data will be recorded in the field on GPS-based Computer Assisted Survey Instruments (CASI) preloaded with government designed and authorized software.

Workload and Logistics:                                                                               
It is anticipated that 2 persons will be required at each site to physically collect and enter data into the CASI. It is estimated that one PSU (2 points) can be completed within 16 to 18 total staff hours.

Confidentiality Statement:

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 06-29 Dynamic Multi-Terabit Core Optical Networks: Architecture, Protocols, Control and Management (CORONET); 

CLOSING DATE: Three years from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov;  PROPOSALS FOR THE FIRST ROUND OF SELECTIONS ARE DUE: 12:00 NOON Eastern Daylight Saving Time on October 27, 2006.  POC: Dr. Adel Saleh, DARPA/STO; Email: BAA06-29@darpa.mil;  Website: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/coronet/index.htm

 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the Dynamic Multi-Terabit Core Optical Networks: Architecture, Protocols, Control and Management (CORONET) program.  The objective of the CORONET program is to develop the architecture, protocols, and control and management software for highly dynamic, multi-terabit global core optical networks with greatly enhanced performance, survivability and security.  An important part of the CORONET vision is to enable ultra-fast service set-up/tear-down as well as very fast recovery from multiple network failures.  It is envisioned that the majority of traffic on the network will be Internet Protocol (IP) directly over optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), with a substantial amount of wavelength service traffic as well. 

It is the ultimate goal of this program to transition the CORONET technology, at the end of Phase 2, to commercial telecommunications carriers.

In Phase 1 of the CORONET program, the performers will develop the architecture, protocols and algorithms necessary to deliver the program’s network performance objectives.  Phase 1 will be conducted over an 18-month period, which will conclude with extensive simulations to verify achievement of the performance objectives.  A deliverable at the end of Phase 1 is a full proposal for Phase 2.  In Phase 2, the selected performers will develop the network control and management software and verify its performance to the Government and to commercial telecommunications carriers through appropriate testing.  Proposal instructions for each phase are addressed in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which is published with the BAA.

 

The CORONET program will be conducted in two sequential phases and DARPA is seeking a comprehensive and integrated solution for each phase.  Proposals addressing only a subset of the topics will be considered non-responsive to this BAA.  As such, teaming of proposers to assemble the necessary breadth and depth of expertise and resources is recommended.  A separate selection round will take place for each phase of the program.

 

This BAA shall remain open for three (3) years from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the funding for this program will be committed only during the first and second selection periods as stipulated in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instructions provided herein at any time up to the proposal due date for the respective phase.

 

All submitted proposals will be reviewed.  In order to be considered during the first round of funding, for Phase 1, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-29) on or before 12:00 Noon Eastern Daylight Saving Time, October 27, 2006.

 

The proposal window and instructions for the second round of selections, for Phase 2, will be announced through a revision of this BAA that will occur during the latter half of Phase 1 execution. 

 

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 § 217 and PL 105-261 § 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

 

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Procurement Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or other such appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation.

 

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The evaluation criteria in descending order of importance are: (a) Innovative Technical Approach; (b) Network Study In The Proposal; (c) High-Level Phase 2 Proposal; (d) Work Plan, Management Approach and Past Experience; (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and (f) Cost Reasonableness and Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

 

SECURITY:  All proposals submitted under this BAA will be UNCLASSIFIED. 

 

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the PIP associated with this BAA.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA may access these documents at www.fbo.gov.  

 

NOTE:  Do not contact the contracting officer identified below with respect to this announcement.  All questions should be sent to BAA06-29@darpa.mil.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 an ombudsman had been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman, Mr. Michael R.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS), currently intends to procure on a sole source basis with Specialized Technical Services (STS), 2794 Indian Ripple Road, Beavercreek, OH 45440 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1: “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.” The reason justifying the lack of competition is that STS is the only company that has a low profile night vision goggle (LPNVG) that will meet the Government's requirements. Based on market research, other companies' night vision goggles do not have a low profile design, do not have a dual channel system  providing the operator with depth perception, do not possess a see-through beam-combiner capability that allows for seamless use of the image intensified channel and normal vision, do not have IR LEDs with a high power and low power providing IR illumination whe!  n operating in environments with zero or low ambient lighting conditions, do not have a flip-down refocus len(s) providing the capability to immediately focus on close objects to facilitate viewing maps or vehicle instrumentation, and do not provide the operator the ability to independently adjust the inter-pupillary distance of each tube allowing the user to adjust the fit of the system to his unique facial features so that the full field of view may be achieved. The requirement document for the LPNVG defines this requirement and requires that the system be lightweight, compact for ease of use, and provide an abridged profile that reduces the neck strain on the user. It must be simple to operate (by a Marine with minimal dexterity), and shall incorporate a low hardware profile configuration and a see-through capability. The system is worn during periods of limited visibility/darkness in order to enhance combat effectiveness. It uses multiple mounting capabilities (i.e., he!  ad harness, fixed mount, helmet strap, etc). The LPNVG system shall be  a small, lightweight, ruggedized image intensifier (I²) system that incorporates GEN III/GEN IV image intensifier tube technology. The system is used for target detection, recognition, identification and as a navigational aid. The low hardware profile assembly shall not exceed a threshold size of 3.25 inches profile and a weight threshold of 1.75 lbs. The image intensified field-of-view is 40° in each monocular of the binocular goggle system.  The system must operate at altitudes up to 35,000 feet. Operating temperature range must be 0° F to 120° F and capable of withstanding saltwater immersion to 3 meters.  The Government anticipates an estimated  purchase of 400 units.  See Note 22 for any responses to this announcement. Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Mr. John Wahl at (703) 432-3577 or john.wahl@usmc.mil.  The date and time of closing is Tuesday, 22 August 2006, 3:30pm EST (Eastern Standard Time).  The syn!  opsis number is M67854-06-R-1077.  This is a follow-on to a former buy of said item.  The Government intends this procurement to be a one time buy. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 333314-Optical Instrument and Lens Manufacturing.

The goal of the US Navy is to train navigation, seamanship, and shiphandling to a level that is deemed equivalent to International Maritime Organization (IMO) STCW/46CFR and to provide additional US Navy special evolutions training. Training will be for designated Navy personnel using Government furnished (GFE) Navigation, Seamanship, Shiphandling (NSS) simulators located in Government furnished facilities at the following US Naval Fleet Concentration Areas (FCA): Norfolk, San Diego, Everett/Bremerton, Mayport, Pearl Harbor, Sasebo, and Yokosuka. Government furnished NSS training si!  mulators meet the requirements identified in Section A-I/12 of the STCW Code and consist of; generic US Navy ships bridge structure/pilot house; RADAR/ARPA and control console; Pelorus, binocular view, chart table, communications system, ECDIS-N console, helm, throttle, autopilot for vessel conning, and Instructor/Operator Station (IOS). All simulated instrument and vessel actions and reactions correlate to the movement of the selected vessel, control settings, and adjustments, simulating total shipboard bridge operational situations, including open-ocean maneuvering and advanced maneuvering in restricted waterways, for safe navigation and collision avoidance. The Government will provide OEM simulator system training to a limited number of the awardees’ instructors. Instructional services required will include the development and modification of training materials, products, and curriculum. STCW equivalency course instructors must meet the qualifications identified in A-I/6!   of the STCW Code or 46CFR10.309.

Non-US Navy specific NSS instruction requires Instructors with minimum of two (2) years ship’s bridge operations and one (1) year classroom instructional experience. Non-NSS course instructors must have instructional experience relevant to the topic. Sasebo and Yokosuka training sites are currently operational and instructors must be ready to commence instruction at those sites within 30 days of contract award. Instructors must be available to commence training upon installation of the NSST systems in the remainder of the designated FCA’s tentatively scheduled: Everett/Bremerton – 4th Q FY 06; Mayport – 1st Q FY 07; Pearl Harbor – 1st FY 07; San Diego and Norfolk – 2nd Q FY 07. Specific throughput numbers for this new training capability and expanded training capacity are not available. Current training !  requirements, however, require forty (40) hours of NSS training every two (2) years for 62 ships in San Diego, 64 in Norfolk, 13 in Pearl Harbor, 21 in Mayport, 8 in Everett/Bremerton, 7 in Sasebo, and 13 in Yokosuka. The period of performance will be one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The government intends to make an award before the end of calendar year 2006.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO PRODUCT DATA SERVICES CORPORATION, 9534 Selby Place, Norfolk, VA 23503.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement to update software previously developed by Product Data Services for the NSWCCD Design Tool Development Branch.  This task will enhance the NSWCCD LEAPS Tool Kit software by adding modules for receipt and delivery mechanical data.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 – Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The sole source is based upon the contractor’s extensive knowledge of the international standard.  Since the contractor participated in the international standard with US shipbuilders and the Navy, and they wrote the final document that was published, they know the data model better than anyone in the world.  If the follow-on ef!  fort is awarded to another source, it would result in substantial duplication of training costs and delays not likely to be recovered by competition. Note 22 applies to the extent the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS), 8317 Front Beach Road, Panama City Beach, Florida for the removal of critical combat systems from two MHC Class Ships in Ingleside, TX and the installation of two Field Changes on MCM Class Ships located in Sasebo, Japan and Bahrain.  The procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS) is the only source with personnel residing in Ingleside, TX who have the required extensive experience with all of the MCM combat weapon systems that are being removed from the MHC Ships in Ingleside (AN/SLQ-48(V) Mine Neutralization System (MNS), AN/SQQ-32(V2/V3) Sonar, OK-520 Sonar Winch, AN/SSQ-94 MIW Simulator, AN/SSN-2(V4) Navigation System, AN/SQH-4A Battle Space Profiler System and Windbird System).  IPS is the only company that has personnel who possess an in-depth knowledge of the AN/SLQ-48!   UCHS Cable Accumulators and Vehicle Handling System, knowledge that is required for the installation of the two Field Changes.  In addition, work on this order must be completed within the tight schedule associated with the MHC decommissioning which is to be completed this fiscal year and IPS is the only known source who can complete this tasking in the timeframe required.  Additionally, installation of the field changes must occur during a period of MCM ship availability in August in Japan and Bahrain.  It is estimated that not only would no other source be able to complete tasking within the required timeframe, but that obtaining any other source for this effort would increase its cost by as much as 200%.  FSC code is J020, NAICS code is 541330, SBA Size Standard is $4.0M.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a unique Symmetricom timing product. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items on a sole source basis from Southern Marketing Associated who is a direct distributor for Symmetricom Inc. Symmetricom timing products are unique in that not only do they provide a highly accurate timing pulse derived from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver synchronized oscillator, they have also augmented it to the industry standard Inter Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) B format.From their GPS synchronized IRIG source, they have buffered distribution boxes for the IRIG-B signal which are critical to the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) Systems Integration Lab (SIL) mission since they will ensure that all processor's timing is synchronized, keeping the varied but interconnected simulation task threads, such as aerodynamics and flight control on the same simulation frame.  Of course the different processors will need an interface device to receive this, and Symmetricom is unique in that they have timing cards able to receive the IRIG-B signal for every combination of form factor and operating system that will be used in the Crew Launch Vehicle System Integration Lab.By having timing cards with drivers for the Linux Operating System based computers, Versa Modular Euro (VME) and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) extensions for Instrumentation (PXI) instrumentation chassis all capable of extracting the IRIG-B timing signal, there is a cost savings to the government since there does not need to be a software developer design, develop, implement and test code to automatically set the time and date for multiple non-homogenous platforms, which these cards will automatically perform.  Using any supplier will induce extra cost to the government for researching timing card oscillator accuracy, and verification of disparate drivers for the different Operating Systems and card form factor combinations The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Janet Appleton @ janet.l.appleton@nasa.gov or fax to 256-544-4401 no later than 4:30 p.m. CST 8/11/2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Competition is impractical for the following reasons: Ruska was the original equipment manufacturer of the current Pressure Standard Controllers.  The replacement controllers must be compatible with both the existing computer systems in the Labs as well as the unique software that serves as interface between the controllers and the computer systems. Item 1 Specifications:  Pressure from 0 to 100 psi; range to 100 psi in gauge or absolute via vacuum reference; precision of 0.003% full scale (FS); stability of 0.0075% reading per year; accuracy for one year of 0.003% FS + 0.009% reading; RS-232 and IEEE-488 communication protocols; emulation modes to support Ruska series 7215, 7010, 6000, and DPI 510 controllers; display resolution of 1: 1,000,000; 12 linear an d2 user defined units of measure; vacuum reference shall provide absolute mode of pressure utilizing a second vacuum pump and precision measurement of the residual pressure; uncertainty contribution of the vacuum reference shall be +/- 0.0002 psi per year; power requirements of 90-260 VAC, 50/60 hertz, 150 watt.   Item 2 Specifications:  Pressure from 0 to 1000 psi; range to 1000 psi in gauge or absolute via vacuum reference; precision of 0.005% of reading from 25% to 100% of range; precision of +/- 0.0125 psi below a reading of 250 psi; stability of 0.0075% reading per year; accuracy for one year of 0.009% of reading; RS-232 and IEEE-488 communication protocols; emulation modes to support Ruska series 7215, 7010, 6000, and DP! 510 controllers; display resolution of 1: 1,000,000; 12 linear an d2 user defined units of measure; vacuum reference shall provide absolute mode of pressure utilizing a second vacuum pump and precision measurement of the residual pressure; uncertainty contribution of the vacuum reference shall be +/- 0.0002 psi per year; power requirements of 90-260 VAC, 50/60 hertz, 150 watt.  The pressure controllers will be used in an Automatic Pressure System (APS) using a visual basic application written to perform automated calibrations of pressure transducers, transmitters, and gauges; this APS collects inputs from the operator, unit under test, and the pressure controllers to calculate the run data, shunt values, key numbers, key number history, input/output resistance, class and subclass, calculates slope and offset deviation, precision, max non-linear bias, uncertainty, recall uncertainty, and determines calibration intervals; the controllers shall be plug and play with the existing system so as not to incur additional cost of software rewrite. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Per FAR 19.502-2 (a), this acquisition is set-aside for small business concerns, unless the contracting officer determines there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. For small business set-asides other than for construction or services, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer unless the SBA has granted either a waiver or exception to the nonmanufacturer rule.	As of the date of this synopsis, no such waiver appears to exist.  However, an exception may exist if the total price for the two controllers does not exceed $25,000.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 21, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) Contracts and Control Review Department (CCRD) has a requirement for professional audit services in support of its Premium Compliance Program.  It is anticipated that PBGC may award one or more contracts on a labor-hour basis in support of this program.  The primary objective of the Premium Compliance program is to assess compliance with PBGC premium regulations and filing requirements.  Reports issued by contractors will provide input as to whether plan sponsors have paid PBGC the appropriate amount of premiums and met other filing and reporting requirements.  The contractor will be responsible for complying with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts and Government Auditing Standards as they relate to application of agreed-upon procedures, examinations, and consulting services, as appropriate.  As PBGC has the burden of proving that plan sponsors did not pay the appropriate amount of premiums and the work of the contractor may be subject to review in court proceedings, it is critical that all work be performed in accordance with the referenced auditing standards.  The solicitation document, including any amendments, will be distributed through the FedBizOpps.gov web site.  The site contains downloading instructions.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

<CONTACT>CHRISTOPHER A. NOLTE, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 202 564-1125, E-Mail: nolte.christopher@epa.gov
<DESC>In its effort to continually improve the quality of regulatory benefit and cost estimation, The National Center for Environmental Economics (NCEE) is supporting the development of innovative ecological benefit estimation techniques.  The current analysis of many rules, with regard to ecological risk is sparse in terms of benefits related to ecosystem services and improved ecosystem functions. This should not be too surprising since describing the intrinsic worth of environmental services represents a significant challenge.  To address this deficiency, NCEE has undertaken the development of new ecological benefit estimation methodologies and value estimates. This effort will focus on ecological benefits arising from improved water quality in a specific area.  NCEE will conduct a study designed to quantify a portion of the ecological impacts of improving the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. This new study will examine the effects of improvements in water quality in the Chesapeake Bay on:  --- striped bass populations, both in and out of the bay,   --- expected striped bass catch in the bay, and  --- impacts to both the commercial and recreational striped bass fishing sectors.   The study will follow the methodology utilized by Massey et al. (2006) which estimated the value of changes in recreational flounder fishing due to water quality improvement in Maryland?s coastal bays.  A copy of this paper will be provided to the Contractor. The purpose of this work is to assist NCEE in the development of ecological benefit estimate methodologies, and improved value estimates.  This analysis will focus specifically on striped bass in the Chesapeake Bay.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by the Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronic Program Office (PMA-209) to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0024 with Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA  52498.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is assigned responsibility for the planning, programming, budgeting, procurement, installation, operation, and support of the Air Combat Electronics programs.  This effort covers the requirements to provide the A-10 a robust Line-of-Sight (LOS) secure communications system to fully  integrate with composite combat forces.  An ability to reprogram voice communications in flight provides reliable means of disseminating real-time updates with isolated forces and Command and Control (C2) assets.  Current operations in mountainous and other inhospitable environments are under increasing risk of compromise requiring reduced response times during unconventional air support missions, reduced logistical challenges with sustainment of current equipment and improved interoperable connectivity with communications equipment fielded and used by forces being employed both on the ground and airborne.  The net effect of a secure robust LOS communications capability will be a highly reliable, responsive Close Air Support and Combat Search and Rescue, with lower maintenance enjoyed by materiel improvement.  This effort defines the replacement of the current AN/ARC-186 VHF AM radio with a dual band UHF/VHF radio for a secure LOS capability.  The contractor shall design, fabricate, and deliver a Group A Installation Kit (i.e., unique mounts and any intrinsic wiring/brackets) that are necessary for the installation of a Line-of-Sight (LOS) communications capability.  The Group A and B Kits shall include specialized adapter cables to mate with the existing wiring connectors and the Group B Kit Items (LRU’s).  The contractor shall design the Group A and B Kits such that modification/de-modification time shall be minimized and installation performed by organic field maintenance personnel.  This requirements is for 256 “A” Kits and 50 each RCU Cable Assemblies, RT Mount Assemblies, and Antenna Kits for incorporation into “B” Kits.  As Rockwell Collins is the sole developer of the ARC-210 Family of products and related ancillary equipment and maintain the proprietary rights to this radio, they are the only capable source of providing the requested changes.  Effort will be performed within 6 months ARO.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

The primary location of the CTS is:  CC seat - right side, aft facing at airframe Station 120, AO seat - left side, aft facing at airframe Station 120.  In addition, the AO seat will need to be relocated to the left side cabin wall between Station 160 and Station 190 facing inboard when the left side gun is installed. The location of the CC seat is constant.  Both seats will need to be easily removed to gain access to components located behind install locations.  The Common Crash Resistant Troop Seat System (CCRTSS) performance specification will be used for technical and environment requirements for this procurement.   The  key performance parameters are: Crash capability/survivability Protection:  a.) The seat, the aircraft interface attaching/reinforcement hardware, and the aircraft modifications required for the installation and functioning of the CCRTSS shall be capable of withstanding the following ultimate load factors without structural failure while holding the maximum weight of the occupant range. 
Axis				Applied Separately			Applied Simultaneously
Longitudinal (x)			+20/-15				+20	+20
Vertical (z)				+20/-10				-10	+20
Lateral (y)				„b10					„b10	„b10

Note: The "x", "y", and "z" axis refer to the aircraft coordinate system. The positive direction for each axis shall be defined as follows: "+x" is forward, "+y" is to the right, and "z" is down.  Seats must provide protection for the 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male (110 ¡V 240 lbs) for analysis and qualification test purposes.  Maximum weight of seats and all attaching hardware (one aircraft ship set) is 75 lbs. Draft specifications and pertinent airframe data will be posted on the web at  www.Phrogsforever.com.   A Crashworthy Troop Seat (CTS) Industry Day is scheduled for sometime around 18-20 September 2006 at the Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, NC to discuss the specifics regarding the technical requirements and acquisition schedule. An aircraft will be available to familiarize potential vendors with the required location of the CC and AO seats and for taking measurements.  The CH-46E program is looking to expedite the fielding of these new seats. Submittal of test data substantiating full crash qualification of the seating system will be required as part of proposal submittal. Potential contractors must be able to deliver to the approved government baseline configuration within 9 months of government¡¦s decision to exercise the production option, at a minimum rate of 15 ship sets (30 seats) per month.  Additional aircraft access will be available, by appointment only, for initial seat fit and measurements prior to proposal submission. The estimated quantity for this procurement is 177 kits (354 seats) or other such quantities as may be authorized and appropriated by Congress.   Seats will be procured in a single year.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Subject:  Install/Repair of two new Servo Blades at RD Willis Dam, Sam Rayburn Lake Texas SIC 7699 NAICS: 611310 This is a pre-solicitation the actual solicitation will not be posted till 15 days after this. This contract covers disassembly, inspection, and repair of the blade servomotors, oil heads, mechanical seals, and shaft sleeve for two 4.1 MW S-Turbines at R.D. Willis Powerhouse (Town Bluff Dam), near Jasper, Texas. For the last three years, maintenance  personnel have indicated that the blade servomotor oil was becoming hot from excessive pump operation.  Isolation of the oil lines going to the servomotor piston and subsequent monitoring of pressurized leakage rates has resulted in the determination that  the rings on the piston are leaking several gallons per minute or there is severe scoring of the cylinder the piston rides in.  Plant personnel have indicated that metal shavings have been seen on the oil filters as well as some sort of black hard rubbery  material. It is also possible that the oil head is damaged and leaking.  Other areas of work, separate from the blade servomotor, are the inspections of the turbine shaft mechanical seals and shaft sleeve. The turbine shaft mechanical seals have shown exc essive leakage when the bearing oil leakage return lines and water leakage drain lines have been monitored. The turbine shaft sleeves are believed to be worn and need to be inspected and possibly replaced.   This action will be in compliance with the Service Contract Act as Amended and for all construction with be in compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act as amended.

2.   	Do you require 24x7x365 support for both database and application  systems? If yes, do you have any support matrix (call schedule, callback and ticket logging procedures) that we can follow or we can propose our own?
Answer: BEA does not require around-the-clock support for most software applications, however it should be noted that BEA expects a contractor to be willing to fix any mission critical, production problems during off-hours if it would be detrimental to BEA's mission and public image to delay until normal business hours to correct the problem.  

3. How many resources do you require\expect for each task order and overall for the contract? From objective 1 and 2 in the RFP is not entirely clear how many people can or should be involved in this process. Our initial assessment is that this is 3-6 people project.

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Procurement and Logistics Directorate (PLD), Falls Church, VA has a requirement for procurement of ongoing systems engineering, software development, testing, security, deployment, and sustainment of the DISA Network Common Operational Picture (NETCOP) system. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price contract with Houston Associates, Inc., under FAR 6.302-1. Houston Associates, Inc. and its major subcontractor, SAIC, conducted thorough trials of solutions from 7 different software vendors for a product that would provide a fast correlation engine and customizable rule sets to operate seamlessly within DISA’s complex, multi-vendor environment. During these trials, the product offered by Lucent, VitalSuite® Integrated Service Assurance (ISA) was selected for its network-centric management approach, innovative correlation engine, and its easy rules creation. As such, Houston Associates Inc. is the sole responsible contractor for integration of the NETCOP system, based on Lucent service assurance software. The Lucent product has been customized to monitor and manage network operations across DISA’s regional NetOps Management Centers. Houston Associates Inc. is in a unique position to provide continued critical engineering, operation, management, and maintenance of DISA’s mission critical, high-performance communication networks. The period of performance shall not exceed one (1) year. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however interested parties may submit a capability statement. The Government, for purposes of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement, will consider all capability statements received in response to this notice. The Government reserves the right to process this requirement on a sole source basis based on the responses received. Capability statements are due to the contract specialist, Attn: Khaleelah Wright, Code PL62, Defense Information Systems Agency, 5111 Leesburg Pike, Suite 900A, Falls Church, VA 22041, khaleelah.wright@disa.mil, by the close of business on 16 August 2006.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is issuing this request for information (RFI) in support of the C/KC-130T Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  This RFI is a follow-up posting to the original notice under N00019-06-R-0040 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code number 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with the size standard in number of employees at 750. 

The Navy is looking to upgrade the avionics subsystems for the USMC KC-130T and Navy C-130T aircraft.  The desired modernization solution will be accomplished by replacing aging, unreliable equipment and adding additional equipment necessary to meet Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The end solution will reduce parts obsolescence and maintenance work and reduce aircrew size while providing  increased situational awareness to the aircrew.  The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate existing aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.  

Attached are draft documents of Section B, Contract Line Item Numbers and Section C (SOO, CDRLs, and SRD).  Interested parties should submit their written comments and questions no later than 18 August 2006 to Mary Ann Foran, MaryAnn.Foran@navy.mil Angela Tennyson, Angela.Tennyson@navy.mil.  These comments will be addressed during an Industry Day to be held tentatively on 30 August 2006 in Lexington Park, MD.  More information will be forthcoming on specifics for the Industry Day in a later posting.

This is not a request for proposal.  It should not be construed as a commitment or a guarantee of any kind by the US Navy that it will issue a solicitation. The US Navy does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI) and all information shall be made available at no cost to the government.  If any response(s) is (are) received, acknowledgement of receipt will not be made nor will evaluation of any information provided be given at this time. Any information provided to the US Navy in response to this RFI will become US Navy property and will not be returned.  All proprietary information will be treated appropriately.

While it is understood that FedBizOpps is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FedBizOppss is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. You may also access information on the NSWC Crane Division web site at http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/homepage.htm. This modification is being issued pursuant to the procedures at FAR 13. This modification can be viewed at The Government has already awarded purchase order number N00164-06-P-1035 to Autonomous Solutions (ASI) of Young Ward, UT on a sole source basis. The services were procured on a sole source basis because of duplication of cost that would be incurred by the Government and excessive time delays that would be experienced in accordance with FAR 6.0302-1. The Government now has requirement for related services that are closely tied to the work that ASI has already accomplished under the existing purchase. Thus, the Government intends to modify the existing purchase order to procure these new requirements because it has been determined that the same rationale for restricting competition still exists. Further inquires may be submitted to, Robert Russell, VOICE: 812-854-1450, FAX, 812-854-1175, or e-mailed to robert.russell@navy.mil. All required information must be received o!  n or before 3 PM, CST, 8/8/2006.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional information on the TDP  and the Solicitation.  Please note the changes to the solicitation as noted  below. In regard to the TDP: 1)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P7 â€“ Where is the data for this booklet?  Is this GFM?      The operatorâ€™s instruction pamphlet will be provided as GFM. 2)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P8 â€“ Is this leakage test required at the final LAP level or  at the ammo can vendor level?       The leakage test is required at the final LAP level 3)  DWG 932241 â€“ Olin is the only approved source.  We are aware that Olin has been running at capacity for several months filling contractors requirements  for 40mm M781.  What is TACOMâ€™s view on allowing other sources?      The TDP is for informational proposes only.  The round has to meet the  Performance Specification provided in the Solicitation.  Note that currently  Olin is the only .38 Caliber Case vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;  another vendor may be qualified in the future.   4)DWG 9275763 â€“ Why is this drawing in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded. 5)DWG 9345327 â€“ Same question as question #1      Currently Olin is the only primer vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;another vendor may be qualified in the future.  6)HCSDS 643 â€“ Why is this in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded.   7) The drawing for the silhouette was not provided with the TDP.      Drawing number 6006874 entitled Target Silhouette â€œEâ€ Kneeling is not part of the TDP.  Please send an email to kgorman@pica.army.mil to request a copy. 8)Is there a TDPL?      The TDPL is Document: 06BBH210A on the CD.  You may right click on the CD  and hit the explore option.  There is a version of the TDPL (06BBH210A) in  Adobe and in WordPad.  You may access the TDPL using either of the two programs.  9)Is there a drawing or more information about the tube the rounds are  placed in with the ammo can?      The dimensions of the tube are in lower right side of drawing 9209204.  In  the upper left side of the same drawing there is a â€œLIST OF PARTSâ€ box.  Line #12 and remarks C and F under the list of parts box give the specifications the  tubes are governed by.  If you look up the specifications it will give further  information on how the tube should be constructed. In regard to the solicitation: 1)Page 1 of 101 â€“ the Government says see schedule for deliver.  We  believe it says later F.O.B. origin. Please confirm with location.      Reference page 14 for Delivery information.  All items are F.O.B Origin. 2)Page 1 of 101- The government has identified the NAISC code as 332992.   Is this correct.  Ammunition over 30mm is typically 332993.        Reference page 1 block 10 and page 6 paragraph 5, the NAICS code shall be  corrected to state 332993,  the Size Standard Shall remain 1500.    3)Page 1 (& 67) of 101 â€“ The Government has identified this contract as  a small business set aside.  What is the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the  employee size and annual sales as it applies to small business and this SIC code?  What is the government interpretation in regard to subsidiaries, joint  ventures, etc.  What is the governments level of interest in ensuring that this  is awarded to true small business?  Will there be any requirement or  investigation beyond the standard SBA response of â€˜self certificationâ€™ without  independent 3rd party evaluation.        Since this solicitation involves furnishing a manufactured product, the size standard is stated in number of employees (in this solicitation that is 1,500), there is no annual sales figure involved.  The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requirement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.  Please reference page 16 for a basic  guide when clauses reference a UCF section.  In ARDEC 34 which reference H or  appendix I (52.212-1  or 52.212-4), there is no AIE listed as available in the  referenced sections.   10)Page 31 of 101 â€“ Does TACOM have MSDS from current inventory of M1006?        There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?      If the item has been produced before to the technical data package that  the vendor is to use and there have not been any modifications to the design (i.e. Engineering Changes), then the DVT could in theory be waived or just not  conducted.  We would still need to ascertain whether or not the vendorâ€™s  process is capable or â€œrobustâ€ because this is his/her first time producing the  item and First Article Testing (with subsequent Lot Acceptance Testing) is the vehicle to use to do that.  14)  Page 87 of 101 â€“ under proposal format Part â€“B design format.  What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.        Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Format paragraph a) shall be revised to  state â€œThe proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set forth in the  table below.â€ 16)  Page 87 of 101-Lists the quantities for Volumes 1,3, & 4 but no requirements for Volume 2.  Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.       Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Instructions paragraph b shall be revised to state â€œOriginal and four paper copies of Technical, Management Factor and  Past Performance.â€  Paragraph d shall be revised to state â€œTwo electronic  copies of (c) aboveâ€¦..â€  Page 91 of 101 is correct as stated.  17)  Page 89 of 101 - Volume I, Technical part C: Is the listed information  required, if contractor has an up-to-date ISO 9001-2000 Certification, e.g.  design of inspection and testing equipment, quality system plan, etc.?      Reference page 82 of 101 ARDEC 148 Offerorâ€™s Quality Assurance System (b) (1). If you indicate in your response to this solicitation that your quality  system conforms to one of the listed standards in Section E â€“ Higher Level  Contract Quality Requirement FAR 52.246-11, this is a sufficient description. You need not further describe your quality system in your response to the solicitation. 18)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Where do we get copies of ARDEC 148 and ARDEC 34?    As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.  The clauses are listed in numeric order. 19)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Part B â€“ (b) â€“ To supply test reports and data implies  that the contract must have already produced the round.  Is it a requirement of  the contract that the bidder have produced the round previously?        We are not requiring the round to have been previously produced.  The M1006 solicitation is based on the provided Performance Specification.  The bidder may answer the solicitation with a round that meets the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification.  In the event that another round other than the M1006 is submitted ARDEC would like to review any test data as outlined in the Performance Specification for the round being submitted.  The M1006 has test data generated from previous qualification testing.   20)  Page 89 of 101 - Proposal Instructions, item a) refers to Contract Data  requirements List (DD Form 1423 with blocks 17 and 18 completed).  DD Form 1423  has no Blocks 17 and 18.     Block 17. Price Group and 18. Estimated total price are located in the right margin of the CDLR. 21)  Page 90 of 101- States Volume II Management Factor consists of 3 Parts.  Only two parts Part A and Part B are listed. Please Clarify.    Page 90 of 101 shall be corrected to stated Volume II-Management Factor  Consists of 2 parts. 22)  Page 92 of 101 â€“ Does the government have a spreadsheet like this it is  could provide to all contractors, so that there are no formula or mathematical  errors that could adversely effect the award of the contract?     It is not necessary for the Government to supply this spreadsheet to all  contractors.  This is just a sample of how the weighted guidelines will be  computed.  When submitting a proposal one only need to provide a price for each  line item and quantity range.  The Governmentâ€™s Price analysis will perform the  weighted average analysis for total price. 23)  Page 98 of 101 â€“ Evaluation of offers TDP.  Please explain what there is a  separate TDP from the government supplied TDP?     One can submit a technical data package based on the performance  specifications.  It is not a requirement to follow the Governmentâ€™s TDP.  The Governmentâ€™s TDP is for informational purposes only.   24)  General â€“ Is there a page limitation?      There is no page limit. 25)  General â€“ Do each section of the proposal need to stand alone?  I.E. â€“ If  we discuss additional quality aspects outside of the quality section (Technical Factor, Part C) as they relate to another area will these comments be included  in the overall evaluation?  If not, MAST may have to be more repetitive to  ensure that each section has adequate content.        When submitting the proposal it is best to be as clear as possible.  Iâ€™d  suggest addressing each section as a stand alone.  If this is not practicable,  please reference the specific.   26)  General-This solicitation includes a performance specification and  drawings.  Does our submission have to meet the performance specification only  and are we free to use our design?  Alternatively, must we adhere to the  supplied drawings and the performance specification?       The item does need to meet the performance specification. You may use your own design, however, it still must meet the requirements in the performance spec.The technical data package (TDP) is for informational purposes only.  You can choose to design to the TDP, but it is not a requirement of this solicitation.

<DESC>Q:  For Level 3 workstations, are they a "U" station or a "L".  The SOW is not specific and this could change pricing drastically. A:  If I am interpreting your question correctly, then it is a â€œUâ€ than  an â€œLâ€.    Q:  For Building 12-What size stations for the Level 5?, 8x8 or 8x10?  A:  Bldg 12 is not â€œtypicalâ€ as in Section B.  Please refer to Section 3.10.1  of Delivery Order #2. Q:  Where is the main entranceway for visitors for bulding 12?  The SOW is  calling for a few reception type stations outside of offices, there is no  statement in the SOW as to where they should go.  A:  Please refer to Amendment #13 for specifics regarding Bldg 12  Admin/Reception.  The SOW is â€œgeneralâ€ for the life of the contract. Q: In building 12-which room is the conference room?  There is no label, also,  what size table is needed, there is no size specified in the SOW.  A:  Please refer to Amendment #13.  Please see requirements under 3.10.3 under  Delivery Order #2 for requirements.   Thoroughly identify all details of your  solution in your proposal. Q:  How many private offices in building 12?  The SOW is not specific as to  which is the lab and which are private. A:  Please refer to Amendment #13 and Delivery Order #2. Q:  How important is it to have a universal connector? A:  Very.   Q:  What do you consider a universal connector? A:  Metal connectors that join steel frames for quick  installation and stability.  If a cubicle needs to be moved,  it should not affect the entire unit/group.  A cubicle can  be added and another connection can be made while the  walls stay in place. Q:  Ethospace is listed as an approved product for this solicitation, but yet  you state that the thickness of the panel can be no thicker than 2-1/4" and  the Technology Wall can not exceed 5".  Ethospace's thickness (for both) is 3- 1/2".  Does this product still qualify? A:  Yes.  It was NOT our intention to exclude any manufacturer  based on any panel thicknesses, but to ensure equivalent  QUALITY across the various product lines.   In general, the  salient features of the system quality for office furniture of the  product lines listed in Section 3.6 are acceptable.   "Strict adherence to the salient features" is for functionality and quality. Q:  On page 15, the level 3 station specs state that the furniture needs to be  free standing, but on page 19 there is no mention of the workstation being  free standing furniture.  Can you please verify which it should be? A:  Page 15, Level 3, is in the Statement of Work (SOW) and "general" requirements for the life of the contract.  Level 3 can be either free standing OR system furniture based on the requirements in each Delivery Order.  Page 19 is specific to Bldg 94 and in Delivery Order #1. Q:  Section 3.9.1.1 Acoustic Requirements Per GSA document FCNE 87-441E, dated June 3, 2003, for a panel to be  considered â€œacousticalâ€ it must have and NRC= 0.65.  If we provide a panel  that meets these GSA guidelines for acoustical panels, would that be  acceptable?   A:  No.  0.65 is less absorptive to sound.  Noise is a critical factor. Q:  3.9.1.3 Would panel heights with 12â€ increments be acceptable?  For instance, are  heights of 30â€, 42â€, 56â€, 66â€, 78â€ which are currently used at Picatinny  considered to be acceptable? A:  The panel heights listed in 3.9.1.3 provides more options than  you have listed.  Increments of 12â€ would be more costly for  the Government, than one large panel.  However, if you  GUARANTEE no additional cost to the Government and that the  stacked 12â€ panels are as sturdy and structurally compatible  in terns of stability and safety, then it is acceptable. Q:  3.9.1.4 Can the nominal panel thickness exceed 2-1/4â€?  For instance, is a 3 inch  panel thickness like those currently installed at Picatinny acceptable?    A:  If the systems quality meets or exceeds the quality on  Page 5, Section 3.6 of the SOW, then the â€˜to-scale space  planâ€™ submitted with your proposal will serve to correct for  the variations. Q:  3.9.2 Add on panels Are add-on panels/tiles in height increments of 12â€ acceptable?  For example  are panel add-on units of 12â€, 24â€, 36â€, etc. acceptable? A:  If you GUARANTEE no additional cost to the Government and that the panels are as sturdy and structurally compatible in terns of  stability and safety, then it is acceptable. Q:  3.9.4 Doors Provided that 80â€ high doors meet the solid door requirements, can the 64â€  Sliding doors which will attach to the panel systems be translucent? (given  that most people can see over them anyway)  A:  No.  The two heights are required to accommodate those buildings with special requirements and taller panels. Delivery Order #1 for Bldg 94 requires sliding doors in the 80â€ height since the partitions must be a minimum of 80â€ (see page 20, under Section 3.10.3). Q:  End tables, "curved 45 degree end table" what is quantity, do they get  positioned with the 10 90 degree end tables? A:     Please check D.O. #2 and amendments.                Q:  Do the forty 30 x 60 laboratory tables become part of the 51  workstations ,and  are they an auxiilary work surface to be included in the  workstation?  If that is the case is there a description for that job level  workstation description including that 30 x 60 table. A:     No.                Q:   or are the computer tables meant to be only used in open common  areas....? â€“ A:    Please read D.O. #2 and Amendment #13. Q:  Can you please advise minuimum table requirment for the three lab tables  in each of the open plan rooms? A:  Refer to D.O. #2 and Amendments. Q:  There are no files in building 94, are the files in building 12 meant to  go into the file room or on the open floorplan.  A:  The files in Bldg 12 are meant to go on the  open floor plan in available space. Q:  Could some of the level descriptions, ie: level 2 in building 12, relate  only to South side of building? A:  No Q:   please indicate more clearly what is required of bulding 12 level 2, as  on page 21, it states no furniture requierd, but on page 15 there is a  description of level 2 furniture requiements for building 12.  A:   - Page 15 is â€œgeneralâ€ in the SOW for the life of  the contract.    - Requirements specific to Bldg 12 are in Delivery  Order #2 and some of the amendments.   - Section B, beginning on page 26 are â€œtypicalsâ€

<RESPDATE>081006
<ARCHDATE>10092006
<CONTACT>Deborah  Krems, 314-331-8515
<DESC>Question & Answer for W912P9-06-R-0724 Upstream Protection Cell Lock & Dam 24, Pike County, Missouri Please note: As of COB, 4 August 2006, no more questions will be accepted for this solicitation. Question 1: Dear Ms. Krems, Specification Section 05120, paragraph 3.1.1 calls for the fabricator of the steel cell structure assembly to be certified under the AISC Quality Certification Program for Conventional Steel Building Structures. The undersigned contractor hereby requests that a fabricator who is not so certified be allowed to perform the steel fabrication on the required cellular assembly. Any fabricator that we utilize would perform the work with welders who are certified per AWS D1.1 and third party testing as required under this contract would be performed. The resulting quality would be every bit as good as that delivered by any AISCcertified fabricator. The materials would be documented with certifications provided in either case. Brennan has fabricated many key weldments for the three Corps of Engineers Districts on the Upper Mississippi River. Uncompromised quality has been delivered every time. Currently our own welders are rebuilding the tainter gates at Lock 24. St. Louis Testing is performing the non-destructive weld testing and has yet to find a compromised weld. Brennan places quality construction and safety above all else. We would never deliver a cell that was not of the very highest quality. The final fabrication of the cell must take place either on a barge or near enough to be transported to a barge for delivery to site. The structure is too large to be transported over land by any means. These logistical conditions severely narrow the field of fabricators even without the AISC factor applied. We have two such fabricators in close proximity to our La Crosse yard; however neither is AISC-certified. Both have produced critical weldments for Corps projects in the past and are more than capable of producing a cell of the highest quality. One of these fabricators was previously AISC Bridge Certified but allowed the certification to expire because it was needed so infrequently that a poor return was realized from the fees required by AISC. AISC markets its certification; however they offer nothing beyond elevated administration-related overhead and the AISC name to a firm that is already highly quality oriented. To sum this up: I feel that with the material documentation and certification; the welder certification and third party testing required, there will be no possible compromise in the quality of the end product as a result of allowing one of our non-AISC certified fabricators participate in this solicitation. Please address any questions to the undersigned at (608) 784-7173, ext. 233. Sincerely, Steven D. Becker Lock & Dam Division Manager J. F. Brennan Co., Inc. Answer 1: Steve, Our engineers looked at your request below and this is their response: The requirement for the fabricator to be certified under the AISC Quality Certification Program for Conventional Steel Building Structures will not be waived. The certification requirement is to ensure that a certified structural steel fabricating facility has the personnel, organization, experience, procedures, knowledge, equipment and commitment to produce fabricated steel of the quality required for this project. Thank you. Question 2: Good afternoon Debbie. I have a question about the Data sheet for Performance survey. I understand they want these filled out for Key Personnel instead of resumes. However, does that mean the Key person would sign it where the subcontractor consent is or just anyone who has authority for that particular company sign it? Thanks, Kathy J. Dorethy EEO Administrator Midwest Foundation Corporation 309-925-2831 Answer 2: The key person with your company does not have to sign the data sheet for Performance survey. If the key person is with a subcontractor, then the key p erson would have to sign it. Thank you.

<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC (BSA) requires Architect-Engineering Services (A&E Services) for design and construction support services for the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS II) project, which is expected to be located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY 11973.

The NSLS II will be an advanced, highly optimized third generation medium energy storage ring with full injection for top-off mode operation.  The X-ray brightness and flux of NSLS II will be world leading, exceeding that of any other currently existing or under construction.  It will be 10,000 times brighter and have 10 times higher flux than the present NSLS.  NSLS II will meet the nation’s need for a high brightness, medium energy X-ray source. It will enable structural studies of the smallest crystals in structural biology, provide a wide range of nanometer resolution probes for Nanoscience, enable coherent beam scattering studies of the dynamics of condensed matter systems, and enable new methods for imaging the structure of disordered materials and biological systems.

The NSLS II will replace the existing NSLS which has served a large community of researchers and users for over 23 years.  The NSLS II will be located in close proximity to the NSLS, to the south and east of the corner of Brookhaven Ave. and Grove Street.  The proposed site for the NSLS II is a previously developed open field area with no known legacy of environmental contamination.  The site is level and reasonably proximate to BNL’s underground utility systems.

The conventional facilities required for the NSLS II will include a Ring Building of approximately 350,000 square feet.  Additional small utility buildings may be required depending on ultimate design of utility systems.  

The Ring Building will serve as the centerpiece of NSLS II and will house the operations center, department offices, offices for the visiting User community, laboratory space, the main accelerator ring, the experimental beamlines, experimental floor area and supporting facilities.  Potential for radiation exposure to the accelerator and its components will require provisions for shielding of the accelerator from occupied areas.

The proposed construction type for each building will be reinforced slab on grade with perimeter footing, structural steel frame with composite reinforced concrete slab on metal deck for upper floors, and insulated metal panel exterior.  Roofing may be a combination of standing seam metal roof, built-up bitumin or membrane roof systems.  

Although the building design will generally involve standard commercial design and construction techniques, there are some additional considerations due to the specific requirements of the accelerator, experimental beamlines and types of research that will take place in laboratory spaces. Special consideration must be given to the floor slab design to minimize differential settlement to assure alignment integrity of the installed accelerator and beamlines.  Consideration must also be made in the building design to minimize sources of vibration and transmission of vibration that would impact beam stability in the accelerator and experimental beamline areas and laboratory spaces.  Additional consideration must be made in the design and routing of electrical cabling and placement and shielding of electrical equipment to minimize EMI and RFI fields in the experimental beamline areas, certain portions of the accelerator and laboratory spaces.   There will also be specific temperature stability requirements in the accelerator, experimental beamline and certain laboratory spaces that will require HVAC system and control design that exceeds standard commercial practices.

The NSLS II location is proximate to BNL’s existing underground utility systems.  NSLS II will be connected to BNL’s high voltage power distribution system, underground steam and condensate system, sanitary system, potable water system, telecommunication and data system, site-wide fire alarm system and storm drainage system.  An evaluation will be performed to determine if expansion of and connection to the underground central chilled water system is preferred to construction of local stand-alone chilled water capacity for the NSLS II. 

The estimated cost for construction of conventional facilities is approximately $135,000,000 to $150,000,000. 

This is a Request for Qualifications of A&E firms interested in contracting for this work. A&E firm, as used in this synopsis, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project preliminary and design documents. The scope of the A&E services required under this proposed contract includes, but is not limited to, the following: Preparation of design documents for the NSLS II facility through preliminary and definitive design phases.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

For CMc Contractor
Construction of New U.S. Port of Entry
Portal, Burke County, North Dakota


The purpose of this notice is for the General Services Administration to ascertain qualifications and serious interest among HUBZone firms for a construction project to build a new Port of Entry in the town of Portal, Burke County, North Dakota.

NOTE:  This announcement is not a presolicitation notice or a request for proposal.

MAGNITUDE:  $15 million to $20 million

SITE:  The site work will require extensive preparation and fill and the abandonment of existing utility infrastructure and construction of new.  Approximately three feet of imported fill will be required for the main port building to bring the building out of the water table.  Site drainage is via surface runoff to an engineered swale.

CONSTRUCTION:  Construction includes six main structures:  the main port building of 35,450 square feet, and secondary buildings totaling approximately 38,000 square feet.  The main port building has a southern orientation with passive solar design elements.  This is a two story structure with public areas and private offices for the inspection agencies.  All of the buildings utilize pre-engineered metal building construction technology.  Included in the secondary buildings are an indoor firing range, garage space, and offices for the U.S. Border Patrol.  Basic construction materials are metal siding and standing seam roofing with metal stud structure, masonry and concrete.  Paving areas for both large trucks and personal vehicles is concrete and flexible asphalt.

CHALLENGES:  The town of Portal is located in a remote area of North Dakota on the Canadian border.  With a population of 350 people, the labor pool and supply sources in the local area are extremely limited.  The construction of this project will require the importation of a majority of construction equipment, materials, and labor forces.  The nearest source of materials and labor is approximately 100 miles away one way.  On-site full-time supervision of the project will be required.  Limited housing is available for any labor forces.  Generally, housing for construction crews and supervision must be provided by the contractor for the duration of the project.  Severe weather conditions prevail during the fall and winter.  Schedules and sequencing of work will need to be adjusted to accommodate these conditions.  Extensions of contract period will not be given for normal weather conditions for that locale.  This is a federal inspection facility, and security background checks will be required of all labor and management performing work on this project.  LEED certification is a requirement of this project, and experience by the prime contractor in managing a successfully completed LEED project will be required.  The Government does not anticipate an economic price adjustment allowance for volatile materials pricing.

If your firm is seriously interested in providing a future proposal for this project, please provide the following information by close of business August 16, 2006:

1.	What is the largest construction project your firm has completed as prime contractor?  Is your firm able to provide a bond of $20 million?
2.	Describe how your firm, as prime contractor, would comply with the Small Business Administration requirement to perform a minimum of 15% of the cost of the contract with your own workers and stay within the size determination requirements?  Describe the organizational structure of your planned team, indicating responsibilities of small businesses and large businesses within that structure.
3.	Give an example of a construction project that was managed by your firm and successfully LEED certified.
4.	Has your firm ever completed a construction project under a CMc (construction manager as constructor) type contract?  If so, explain your firm's approach at CMc management.
5.	Provide example(s) of projects completed by your firm that included traffic circulation routing of both personal vehicles and semi-trucks.
6.	Explain your firm's management strategy for projects in remote locations and extremely cold climates.

Responses should be sent via email to Contracting Officer Nancy Gertler at nancy.gertler@gsa.gov with cc: to Craig.Johnson@gsa.gov.

Background:  Trademark law in particular is a highly specialized field requiring knowledge of a variety of statutes, familiarity with the administrative practices of the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (PTO), and a working knowledge of the case law concerning the use and licensing of marks.  Non-attorneys-including representatives of corporate entities – are forbidden by law from representing another party in a trademark matter.  The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has authority to conduct all trademark-related work on behalf of all the agencies in the Public Health Service PHS).  The TTB of the NCI is primarily responsible for negotiating certain research agreements relating to technology development, for example, Material Transfer Agreements, Confidential Disclosure Agreements, Clinical Trial Agreements, and Cooperative Research and Development Agreements.  These agreements facilitate the research of NIH’s scientists whenever their projects require interaction with the private sector.

Proposed Statement of Work for Information Only.  Technical Requirements:  A) Direct Action.  Handle specified tasks regarding particular marks.  The contractor shall provide quality service and a high level of effort consistent with legal standards established in the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct, combined with both regular and as-requested updates to TTB regarding the status of each case.  B)  Direct Mark Searches and Prosecution.  For unregistered marks, contractor may be requested to conduct portions or all of the prosecution of the mark.  TTB anticipates two marks per year where the contractor interacts directly with PTO for the entire prosecution of new marks.  These steps include:  searching for existing marks that have senior rights; preparing the PTO trademark application; filing the trademark application in the PTO; and preparing legal memoranda for a formal reply to PTO Office Actions; and preparing any auxiliary documentation required by the PTO to allow registration.  C) Direct Maintenance and Licensing of Marks and Conducting Oppositions.  For registered marks, contractor may be requested to maintain the mark and/or handle the negotiation and drafting of one or more licenses of the mark.  The contractor shall provide a monthly report of the status and action due dates of all applications and registrations managed by TTB.  This report shall include, listing of due dates for affidavits of use, renewal dates, and response dates for office actions.  In addition, the contractor must establish a procedure for specifically reminding TTB one year prior to the due date of any maintenance document that must be filed in the PTO, e.g. Section 8 Affidavits. Contractor shall provide written formal or informal recommendations on the strategy of filing any particular Opposition or Cancellation and TTB may request that the Contractor prepare and file some or all of the documents required for these proceedings.  D)  Direct Conduct of Foreign Interactions.  Provide assistance in formal interactions with any trademark office in a foreign country regarding A PHS mark registered in the United States.  Upon request by TTB, the contractor shall conduct those interactions on behalf of TTB.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the procedural requirements and actions imposed by the foreign trademark office are communicated to TTB, that the procedural requirements and actions are met at the earliest time that is reasonable under the circumstances and at least no later than any deadlines established by the foreign trademark office.  E)  Training.  At the request of TTB, contractor shall provide training to TTB staff in the filing, prosecution, and maintenance of trademark applications and registrations.  Such training is expected to be in the range of 6-18 hours per year.  In addition, when a change in trademark law directly affects how TTB handles trademark matters, the contractor shall provide written notice of such change, and shall provide training in the change, if requested by TTB.  The contractor may be required to design and produce training materials which can be used as a reference or other resource for TTB to use both during and after the training.  F)  Contractor Staff Expertise and Demonstration of Intellectual Property Training and Expertise.  Contractor shall demonstrate that it will assign to this contract at least three (3) attorneys with sufficient expertise to perform the services of this contract.  Contractor shall be a law firm that specializes exclusively in intellectual property law.  Contractor shall have at least three (3) attorneys and support staff with expertise in trademark law and who practice trademark law almost exclusively.  These attorneys shall be permanent employees of the firm and shall not be outside consultants hired only when trademark services are required.  G)  TTB may request that contractor meet in person with Public Health Service trademark owners at the NIH on short notice.  Therefore, the contractor must be a local firm with its home office(s) in the Metropolitan Wasington, DC area (Washington, DC, Virginia, or Maryland).          

Qualifications:  Attorneys must have graduated from an American Bar Association approved law school and must be admitted to the practice of law in at least one (1) state.

There must be an attorney in the law firm who specializes in litigation of trademark cases, experience must be summarized.  The law firm must demonstrate the procedures they normally use to conduct mark searches, mark prosecution, mark maintenance and the procedures that they have in place to interact with foreign law firms for foreign trademark prosecution.  The law firm must demonstrate the type of access that they have to the necessary trademark searching tools, both U.S. and foreign.

FAR 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency.
(a) Authority.
(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2).
(2) When the agency’s need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.
(b) Application. This authority applies in those situations where
(1) An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition, and
(2) Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.
(c) Limitations.
(1) Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in 6.303 and 6.304. These justifications may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.
(2) This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.
  
3.  Although competition was met through requested verbal RFQ’s, a formal Synopsys/Solicitation was not issued via FEDBIZOPS or GSA advantage.  A Post Award notification will be publicized to identify sources in the event similar requirements should arise in the future.

<SUBJECT>A -- Scientific and Technical Support for NIAID
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, intends to negotiate with the Logical Technical Services (LTS) Corporation under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), for a modification to the work to Contract No. HHSN266200500006C, awarded as a small business set-aside under NAICS Code 541710 for the period of 09/30/2006 through 02/28/2010. The negotiated modification will provide for a level of increased effort over a period of 45 months. Under the proposed modification, the Contractor will continue to provide technical, scientific and logistics support currently required in the areas of Internet and Intranet site development and testing; records management, advisory council and committee support, peer review, support in the grants and contracts areas, and scientific coding for research activities. LTS Corporation is uniquely qualified to continue to fulfill these requirements by virtue of their performance on the current contract.  The nature of the modification involves leasing new space and relocations of contractor staff from federally managed space to contracted space located in close proximity.  The new leased space will require networking/cabling refurbishment to accommodate computers, copiers and office equipment.  One of the critical current and future needs of the contracted staff is data center consolidation.  Currently, within the federally leased space, the contracted staff has an existing information technology data center.  Expanding this facility in place is a less costly solution than transferring the entire system to a new location.  If the proposed extended effort were to be awarded to another contractor at this time, the consequential interruption in the operation of the Division of Extramural Activities would result in unacceptable delays.  Therefore, no other services will satisfy Agency requirements. Because all work in this contract requires contractor staff to work on-site in NIAID facilities some or all of the time and to meet frequently with DEA staff, offerors and their proposed staff, consultants and subcontractors must be located within a reasonable distance to ensure timely attendance to unprompted meetings in NIAID’s offices.  Offerors who submit capability statements must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without undue interruption to the support currently being provided to the NIAID and without unnecessary duplication of cost and effort.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement.  See Government-wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26. No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- NSRP ASE Research Announcement
<DESC>The NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program is interested in receiving abstracts and ultimately proposals (technical and cost) on the research effort described in the solicitation. The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy warships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry-wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers – solutions to consensus priority issues that exhibit a compelling business case to improve the efficiency of the U.S. Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Industry. Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-specific initiatives. Aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards is a requirement of all funded efforts.  Successful projects are those that clearly reduce total ownership costs with benefits that can be delivered by varied combinations of cost reductions in acquisition and fleet life-cycle costs. Identification of specific cost reduction manifestation is an important element of NSRP ASE.  The complete Research Announcement (RA) is also posted at www.nsrp.org along with associated proposal guidance, forms, and sample contracts. This announcement is issued to solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices across the following major initiative areas in U.S. shipyards: Shipyard Production Process Technologies; Business Process Technologies; Product Design and Material Technologies; Systems Technology; Facilities, Tooling, and Risk Management; and Crosscut Initiatives. These major initiatives are described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP) located on the Web at www.nsrp.org. Offerors are strongly advised to read the SIP in order to gain a greater understanding of the sub-initiative areas detailed below. Because the program major initiatives are closely tied to each other, proposals may be submitted with a scope that represents integrated efforts across several major initiative and/or sub-initiative areas.  The Research Announcement will be modified as necessary to reflect changes in industry and/or government priorities.  Potential proposers are reminded that there are several requirements newly incorporated in NSRP Research Announcements beginning in 2004 that bear particular attention, including cost share requirements and project metrics.  Proposers should pay attention to the special interest areas listed in the solicitation.

Full Proposals in response to this RA must be received by October 5, 2006, 12:00 PM (noon) Eastern Time, addressed to NSRP ASE Program Administrator, Advanced Technology Institute, 5300 International Blvd, North Charleston, SC 29418, Attn: Ms. Melanie Ridenhour, ATI Contracts Department.

Questions related to this RA should be directed to the NSRP ASE Program Office, Advanced Technology Institute, Attn: Ms. Melanie Ridenhour, 5300 International Blvd, North Charleston, SC 29418, (843) 760-3366, E-mail ridenhour@aticorp.org.

<SUBJECT>D -- Midcourse Space Experiment Vehicle (MSX) Contract
<DESC>Notice of Proposed Contract Action Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will receive no response.  This Proposed Contract Action is published to notify potential sources of the Government’s intent to modify the existing sole-source contract awarded to Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) by adding additional performance periods.  The resultant contract extensions will be Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) for up to an additional twenty-four months for a total contract performance period of five (5) years.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) Code is 517910 “Other Telecommunications”.  On 28 Dec 2005, the Government provided notice for an anticipated follow-on contract.  The information received from the previous notice provided valuable information and will be utilized to support the Market Research requirements imposed by FAR 5.201.  Several interested parties responded with an expressed interest to provide the services specified and provided capabilities briefings to demonstrate their knowledge and expertise.  The capabilities briefings afforded the opportunity for information exchange between the parties, for which the Government could express the unique circumstances surrounding the MSX program and its resources (i.e. 10 meter dish, acquiring associated peripheral equipment/services and the budget/financial issues).  As a result of this exchange, the Government decided based upon responses from the potential offerors expressing an interest, that the cost/schedule and performance period contemplated presented too great a risk and too little time for offeror’s to recoup their initial investment in this endeavor.

Based upon the information contained herein, the Governments supports the findings specified in FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS (CONT): "	Contractor shall be signed up under current EERA for gel tender capabilities in order to bid on this contract.  Copies of the agreement will be furnished at time of award. "	The Government has interagency and cooperative agreements with other Federal, State, and local agencies, therefore the Contractor should have equipment pre-signed with these agencies (i.e., if contractor is on standby with BLM and CDF breaks a fire, contractor may be dispatched to CDF fire, but must have an agreement on file with CDF). "	If awarded contract, tender and operator shall not be used or other purposes. "	Contractor shall be required to furnish all fuel and operating supplies under subsequent contract.  If dispatched to an incident and the Government has a fuel tender available, contractor may use this service and have this amount deducted from the payment. "	Contractor may be required to furnish a qualified and fully licensed relief operator for shifts exceeding 16 hours. OPERATORS REQUIREMENTS: "	Operators must have proof of having completed at least 8 hours of fire safety training, including fire shelter use, prior to the start of the contract/purchase order. "	Have appropriate level of California Drivers License for the vehicle that they are operating. "	Operators shall have: o	Flashlight o	Personal protective equipment (PPE), including nomex shirts and trousers meeting Cal OSHA specifications (nomex shroud is recommended); 8" leather boots; leather gloves; hard hat, goggles; NWCG approved fire shelter; and a canteen(s) with water (one (1) gallon minimum. MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT: Payment will be made based upon calendar days under hire.  The Contractor will be on duty from 1000 hours to 1800 hours (10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) for a total of eight (8) hours a day.  During this period, equipment will be ready to leave within five (5) minutes of receiving an order to proceed to a fire assignment. During periods of high lightening activity tender/operator may be required to remain on shift for extended staffing.  The daily standby rate shall apply for these additional hours and be calculated as follows: $240.00 (daily rate bid by contractor) divided by 8 hours (number of hours in workday) = $30.00/hour. $30.00 x 2 hours (extending staffing hours) = $60.00 Total payment for the day would be $300.00 ($240.00 daily rate + $60.00 extending staffing). When dispatched to an incident the time under the standby rate will stop and time under hire will be converted to the Emergency Equipment Rental Agreement (EERA) rate until equipment is release from the incident.  If Water Tender is used WITHOUT gel capabilities, time under hire will be paid on Water Tender/EaTIS EERA.  If Water Tender is used WITH gel capabilities, time under hire will be paid on Gel Tender EERA. Contractor will only be paid under one of the payment provisions (standby rate, Water Tender/EaTIS EERA rate, or Gel Tender rate), not a combination of rates.   For example: If the equipment is on shift from 1000 to 1800 and does not "roll" to an incident, they will be paid the daily standby rate for that day.   If the equipment is on shift from 1000 to 1800 and is requested to stay on shift for an additional two (2) hours for extending staffing, they will be paid the daily standby rate, plus and additional two (2) hours of the daily rate for that shift. If the equipment comes on shift and "rolls" to an incident and the tender is used for water only, they will be paid the applicable rate under the Water Tender/EaTIS EERA, or the daily standby rate, whichever is greater. If the equipment comes on shift and "rolls" to an incident and the tender is used for gel, they will be paid the applicable rate under the Gel Tender EERA, or the daily standby rate, whichever is greater. If the equipment comes on shift and "rolls" to an incident and the tender is used for both water and gel, they will be paid the daily standby rate, or the Water Tender/EaTIS EERA rate, or the Gel Tender rate, whichever is greater. INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:  Quotes must be submitted in writing of a SF 1449 or on company letterhead and must include: RFQ number, the company name and address, point of contact, phone number, fax number, unit price, the extended price, grand total, any prompt payment discount terms, and documentation for experience and qualifications.

JUSTIFICATION:

It is essential that maintenance be acquired from the original instrument manufacturer as they represent the only viable source of service capable of providing maintenance and repair to original manufacturer specifications and they can provide manufacturer warranty on that service.

This service contract is for 3 types of Thermo LCMS (Liquid Chromatograph - Mass Spectrometer) equipment: 1) LCQ Deca XP benchtop MS,  2) the LCQ DECA XP Plus, and  3) the TSQ quantum system.  These are extremely sophisticated and delicate instruments used to analyze chemical contaminants in food.  Each model listed above is used for the analysis of a specific type of chemical.  Since these instruments are used to measure very low levels of chemicals, it is essential that they are calibrated properly by highly trained service technicians from Thermo.  In addition, all of FDA labs are now ISO accredited.  In order to meet the stringent levels of ISO accreditation, it is essential that the laboratory equipment be properly serviced by trained personnel.  During maintenance it is usually necessary to replace parts on the equipment which can only be made by Thermo.  A service contract with Thermo would ensure that the technicians have been trained by the company and they are knowledgeable about the equipment, software and replacement parts.

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

On January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) officially ending Africa's longest running civil war.  Over the course of the 21-year conflict, fighting, famine, and disease killed more than 2 million people, forced an estimated 628,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring countries, and displaced more than 4 million people within Sudan.  In April 2003, a separate conflict began in Darfur, western Sudan when the locally based Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) attacked GOS security forces in the city of El Fasher.  The resulting humanitarian emergency in Darfur affects an estimated 3.8 million people, approximately 40 percent of the population, including nearly 2 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and 220,000 refugees in eastern Chad.  The concurrent emergencies have exacerbated already fragile humanitarian conditions, and challenged local capacity to provide for the population. 

INTRODUCTION

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (OFDA/DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (OFDA/PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OFDA/OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, DARTs and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

A USAID Mission is now established in Khartoum, under which DCHA staff in Sudan will work.  All DCHA staff, including OFDA, the Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), fall under the overall management of the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Khartoum.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor oversees all DCHA assistance to Sudan, including the Northern and Southern Sudan provinces and Darfur.  

The Field Officer will support DCHA programs and situation reporting for Darfur, but may be called upon to cover needs in non-Darfur Sudan or Eastern Chad, as needed and determined by the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor in Sudan, and by OFDA/Washington. The Field Officer for Sudan exchanges information regularly with colleagues covering Southern and Northern Sudan portfolios, as well as with OFDA's Sudan program team in Washington D.C.  S/he works with a small team of experienced foreign national staff.  The Field Officer for Sudan travels frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions at sites of OFDA projects, and makes strategic recommendations for interventions to the Darfur Field Office (DFO) Team Leader.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires a Field Officer (FO) for Sudan in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will be responsible for assessing humanitarian needs; monitoring and evaluating DCHA humanitarian programs in the Field Officer's area of responsibility (AOR); assessing the effectiveness of relief activities supported or conducted by the Government of Sudan, the United Nations (UN), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private voluntary organizations (PVOs), international organizations (IOs), and other donor countries; making recommendations on areas of focus for U.S. Government (USG) relief efforts; and providing written assessment and information reports to the Information Officer.  This will be conducted in coordination with other USG disaster relief and humanitarian assistance activities, the UN, IOs, other bilateral donors, and NGO partners.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Under the supervision of the Darfur Team Leader or his/her designee, and in coordination with other DCHA Sudan Team staff, the FO will serve as a primary point of contact for OFDA in the field and will monitor, evaluate and report on DCHA-funded programs.  The FO will be required to supervise and oversee the operations of the assigned field office including Sudanese national staff.  This position requires substantial daily coordination with several DCHA staff members, as well as representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The FO must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team, a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), a Response Management Team (RMT), or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.  Strong verbal and written skills are critical for this position.

* Provide expert technical advice to the DCHA Sudan Team and DCHA's Washington-based offices on humanitarian needs and program activities in the AOR.
* Visit and evaluate DCHA-funded project sites in the AOR on a regular basis, as security permits.  Report to DCHA on the quality of the grantee's work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.
* Monitor food, logistics, infrastructure, health, water, and sanitation conditions, as well as NGO and local organizational capacities, and the role of the UN in providing humanitarian assistance to the region.
* Analyze and provide regular reporting on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o the capacity, ability and level of activity of existing indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o the capacity and ability of the UN, donor governments, NGOs or PVOs to support or implement programs;
o the capacity of local logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o security situation impacts on personnel, convoys, and relief operations as they affect humanitarian activities; 
o problems or concerns in implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of DCHA; and
o overall coordination effectiveness and any recommendations for change.
* Assist NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies that are developing proposals to ensure their compliance with OFDA's Guidelines for Proposals and Reporting, and review concept papers and proposals, providing recommendations/comments to OFDA for final funding determination.
* Participate in coordination with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs in the AOR.  When delegated the authority by the Team Leader, the FO will represent the USG in relevant meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues. 
* Work without direct Team Leader supervision for extended periods of time.
* Participate with implementing partners, key staff from the DCHA Sudan Team in Khartoum, and members of OFDA's Sudan program team in Washington, D.C. in setting priorities and implementing policies.
* Identify and assess the humanitarian assistance requirements of the affected populations, including information on vulnerable groups, their locations, and existing relief programs, and make recommendations for the types of interventions necessary.
* Coordinate closely with the DCHA Team in Khartoum and other field offices, and maintain a daily liaison with UN agencies, IOs, NGOs, PVOs, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
* Collect and consolidate emergency humanitarian information and provide it on a regular basis via field notes, cables, and verbal reporting to the Information Officer in Khartoum.  Submit situation reports, assessment reports and end of tour report.
* Under the guidance of the Administrative Officer, the FO will be required to provide day-to-day supervision for locally engaged staff, help provide some administrative oversight at the field office level, and help to coordinate travel itineraries for very important persons.
* Operate OFDA communications and data processing equipment, including satellite telephones, cellular type mobile phones, and hand held radios.  
* May be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.
* Assist U.S. Embassy staff with humanitarian assistance matters.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a four-channel, 50V, 50A battery test system.  This battery test system must be composed of a PC-type (Windows-based) computer, a user data/control/interface program, and multi-channel, microprocessor-based, modular hardware; and be capable of collecting voltage, current and temperature data on a battery for a particular test channel.	A test channel is defined here as a positional port where the battery being tested is installed, and battery data (current/temperature/voltage) is collected in response to software-controlled test scenarios (profiles such as charge/discharge/rest/heat/cool). This test system must consist of four independent channels.  Each channel is to be software configured, capable of providing a maximum charge/discharge current of +/- 50 Amp and a current range adjustable for constant-current mode to within +/- 0.05% accuracy of full scale tolerance (High 50A, Medium 10A, Low 1A).  Each channel should also have a 0 to +50 VDC voltage range (with the ability to perform a deep discharge down to 0 VDC) adjustable for constant-voltage mode to within +/- 0.05% accuracy of full-scale voltage.  Each channel should have a -100C to 200C temperature range with a +/- 1.0% accuracy of the full-scale temperature.  The +/- 0.05% accuracy for current and voltage should last a minimum of twelve months before calibration is required.  The +/- 1.5% accuracy for temperature should last a minimum of twelve months before calibration is required.  Please see the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for more detailed specifications.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for: 1.  Part number 5099SSPBPRC-100, VME Enclosure 509 Series. Last item. Carlo Gavazzi Computing Solutions, Inc. is the developer, manufacturer and distributor of the Series 509 VME Chassis that is currently used by the Communication & Telemetry  Branch (VA-E1) of the Launch Services directorate within the Telemetry Systems. Facilities within the NASA KSC Hangar AE Building and Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) in California have established systems using the VME Chassis.  Given the mission critical importance of the VA-E1’s unique telemetry hardware, VA-E1 personnel must work to maintain the proper functionality of each system that the organization currently employs by maintaining a fleet of spare replacement parts for vital processing components such as the Series 509 VME Chassis.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106-1 (b) and 13.106-3(b)(3)(i), the acquisition of the VME Chassis has been determined to be available from only one responsible source: Carlo Gavazzi Computing Solutions, Inc.  This determination was made after extensive market research of the internet for alternative supplies yielded no other competitive suppliers of the requested product which would be compatible with the VA-E1’s pre-existing communications and telemetry architecture.  The VA-E1 currently maintains a stock of spare parts to support the Series 509 VME Chassis, maintaining spare parts for each different VME Chassis at both East Coast and West Coast facilities would be undesirable from an operations view point, due to increased opportunity for part and system failure, but in addition, supporting different VME Chassis would not be cost effective for the Government. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-11  This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.  The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334111, 1000 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to Kennedy Space Center, Florida is required within 9 weeks ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Program Management and Analysis Program (IRM/OPS/PMA).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the AIT-3 Internal Tape Drive for Hewlett Packard Servers.  The use of a Cybernetics Tape Drive is essential to the Government’s requirements for server compatibility thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The GITM Program recommends a brand name procurement of the Cybernetics Tape Drive for Hewlett Packard Servers (Part Number CY-8103-00/HP).  Tape media is the primary backup media of use for the Department of State per FAM guidelines for system backup.  Department have standardized on AIT tape format for several years.  The Cybernetics AIT tape drives have been identified as the only internal tape drive that will work with servers in the field.  Use of third party equipment that is not compatible with servers will create equipment installation and configuration conflicts as well as increase the cost of providing tape backup solutions on Department’s classified and unclassified network.   To ensure compatibility with existing servers in the field the Internal AIT-3 Tape Drive must be a Cybernetics unit and provided by a Cybernetics reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cybernetics (Part Number CY-8103-00/HP). as a key component of the Department’s backup system.  Servers in the field have a single 1.6” hot plug tape drive bay and to ensure compatibility with existing servers, the Internal AIT-3 Tape Drive must be a Cybernetics unit and provided by a Cybernetics reseller. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s backup system. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Program Management and Analysis Program (IRM/OPS/PMA).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the Hewlett Packard servers as domain controller and member servers on Department of State’s unclassified and classified network.  The use of Hewlett Packard are essential to the Government’s requirements, for critical server compatibility and network security, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company at this time. The Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p Server (configured to GITM specifications, and Hewlett Packard DL380 G4 (configured to GITM specifications,) Member Server have been identified as a key component of the Department’s core server infrastructure.  IRM ITCCB approved the use of Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified network.   Servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility along with integrated management functions with existing equipment.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the domain controller and member servers must be HP DL360 G4p and DL380 G4 servers and provided by a Hewlett Packard reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p Server (configured to GITM specifications) and Hewlett Packard DL380 G4 (configured to GITM specifications) member servers as a key component of the Department’s core server infrastructure.  HP servers are tested for compatibility with existing hardware and software by the Department to function as domain controllers in a critical support of Department’s Active Directory structure and as member servers supporting application, file sharing, and printing functions.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p and DL380 G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.

GITM would also like the vendor to provide an estimated time of response and plan for escalation to the next level. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government¿s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco Switches and Components have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State¿s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor¿s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department¿s requirements as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. The Cisco switches (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the APC Smart-UPS (part number and descriptions listed in paragraph 2). The use of an APC Smart-UPS is essential to the Government's requirement for server and network infrastructure power protection thereby precluding consideration of the products of another brand at this time. The APC Smart-UPS has been identified as a key component of the Department¿s server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the uninterrupted power supply must be an APC Smart-UPS unit and provided by an APC reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the APC Smart-UPS rack mount server and network infrastructure uninterrupted power supply (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) as a key component of the Department's server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS power protection system works with existing hardware and software fielded in the unclassified and classified network to protect critical servers and data network infrastructure. CHANGED LINE ITEM 009 MFR NAME TO APC.  Changed component part #'s in Line Item 003.  Added Clarification End Date/ Time. Sellers must submit all requests for Clarification and questions by Friday, August 4 at 12:00 PM EST.

The Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) is initiating a program to provide enhanced advisory support and compliance assistance to labor organizations to promote union democracy, transparency, and financial integrity under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA).  This initiative supports the Department’s Performance Goal for a secure workforce by increasing compliance with worker protection laws, specifically LMRDA protections to ensure union financial integrity, democracy, and transparency. The initiative provides for enhanced outreach, compliance assistance, and union advisory services to monitor and assist unions in complying with the requirements of the LMRDA.

CHANGE THE STATEMENT OF WORK FROM:
OLMS will establish a contactor-staffed union advisory unit to directly address three problems that currently cause unioncurrently cause unions to be in violation of the LMRDA or the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) in the case of Federal-employee unions.  
1.	The first problem is that frequently union constitutions and bylaws do not conform to the requirements of the LMRDA and CSRA.  The unit will review union constitutions and bylaws to determine if they contain any provisions that are in conflict with these statutes.  The unit will advise unions of the changes necessary to bring any conflicting provisions into compliance with the Acts.
2.	The second problem is that unions frequently do not file their current constitution and bylaws with OLMS.  The LMRDA requires covered unions to adopt a constitution and bylaws and file a copy with OLMS both initially with the union’s Form LM-1, Labor Organization Information Report, and annually thereafter whenever the constitution and bylaws are amended.  The union advisory unit will institute a program to ensure that OLMS has an up-to-date copy of every union’s constitution and bylaws available for public disclosure on the OLMS Web site.  This will ensure that union members and the public have access to the union governing documents that the law requires be available to them.
3.	The third problem relates to the LMRDA requirement that a union’s Form LM-1 cite the constitutional provisions relating to 13 specific practices and procedures, such as levying assessments or authorizing disbursement of union funds.  If the constitution does not address a procedure, the union must file a detailed statement describing the procedure.   If the procedure changes, the union must filed an amended Form LM-1.  Many unions either do not file a detailed statement or cite a constitutional provision that does not describe the procedure in adequate detail.  Or if they file correctly initially, they do not file an amended Form LM-1 as required when practices and procedures are changed.  The union advisory unit will review a union’s Form LM-1 in conjunction with its constitution and bylaws to insure that the 13 specific practices and procedures are described in sufficient detail to comply with the legal requirements and reflect the union’s current practices and procedures.
The unit will work with unions at the national, intermediate, and local levels to remedy these problems.  Contract staff in the unit will work under the direction of a career employee in the OLMS Office of Policy, Reports, and Disclosure.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-60115-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-11.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Technology Transfers Branch (TTB) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to enhance the current Technology Information Management System (TIMS) database with enhanced features and re-program TIMS to maximize features of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541511, and the business size standard is $21M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Background:  
	General Description: The Technology Transfer Branch (TTB) of the Federal Government’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) converted eight (8) individual and separate flat files of varying record size from FileMaker Pro (FMPro) version 4.1 into a FMPro 6.0 relational database referred to as the Technology Information Management System (TIMS).  Contracts have been awarded to design the new relational database, to design a user interface, and build the database.  The TTB now requires FMPro expertise to upgrade and enhance the database.
	
	Evolution of Requirements: A self-designed “unrelated” FMPro system had been used by TTB for the management and tracking of mission-related work since the early 1990s.  In the late 1990's TTB determined that the number of records and the needs of the office had outgrown the capabilities of the “unrelated” database system.  A relationally designed database  to most efficiently maintain the integrity of and standardize the entry of data, to track mission-related efforts and to produce accurate and cogent reports was developed and has been in use since November 2002.  TTB continues to enhance TIMS to meet the changing needs of NCI and TTB.  Those needs include new technology transfer requirements, specialized reporting to the Office of the Director, NCI, and changes in TTB procedures.		
	
Purpose and Objective:

The TTB is responsible for negotiating agreements between NCI scientist and private sector companies for the collaborative development of federally funded bio-medical research into commercially successful products.  The Main focus of these collaborative efforts is to produce commercial products that will improve the public health.  In addition, the TTB is also a Competitive Service Center (CSC) for technology transfer.  Under the CSC, the TTB negotiates agreements for 10 other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health.  One of the responsibilities of these collaborative agreements is to track the agreement negotiations from initial request to execution of the agreement, and through agreement expiration to final destruction of the physical file itself.  This process can span several years and involve many tracking dates.  TTB currently negotiates eight different types of agreements for the NIH. 
	
	The specific objectives of this procurement are to: 1) enhance the current TIMS database with enhanced features such as reporting, advertising, action items, etc. and 2) re-program  TIMS to maximize the features of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.

Statement of Work:
	CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
	
	Specific Tasks to be Performed:  The contractor shall provide technical skills, insights and expertise on FMPro database development and implementation.  The contractor shall be a certified FileMaker Pro 8 developer.  Due to the complexity of the information that is tracked in the TIMS database, the many inter-relationships of the various agreements, and the need to obtain and integrate into TIMS data from other databases which are written in different programming languages, the contractor shall have at least 10 years FMPro experience in order to perform the work.   TTB shall provide all TTB mission-related information necessary to develop the database upon execution of contract.
	

	1.  	Add additional features to the database from the list of projects below.   The order in which additional features are selected to work on will be determined by a variety of factors such as needs of TTB, logical progression depending on re-programming (see 2 below), etc.  
	
	2.	Re-program the current TIMS database in FileMaker Pro 8.0 to maximize the features of version 8 and enhance the current database structure, file structure and user interface and produce a Beta version: The contractor shall build all of the files with field definitions, create relationships between the files, show related data, and put business rules and constraints in place on field values.  The contractor shall test the system for: 1) the database and file structure design, 2) the user interface for functionality.  Once the system is upgraded, tested, and bug free, the Contractor shall provide a beta version to TTB for testing.  The contractor shall install the Beta version on TTB's server and on 5 TTB staff members' computers.  TTB Staff shall use the beta version for 10 business days and provide comments to the Project Officer.  The Project Officer shall inform the Contractor of all comments.  Corrections and changes shall be made by the Contractor within 30 days from of receipt of comments and corrections.   The Contractor shall provide the final version of the system in a client/server format for about 51 TTB staff members.
	

	3.  	The final product shall be Section 508 compliant.
							
	PROJECTS LIST:
	

	
	1.	Reports:
		a)	Add ability to design or customize individual reports.
b)	Add/enhance ability to easily export report information into Word or Excel

	2.  	Search Function:
		a)	Enhance the search capabilities so they are more flexible and robust
		b)	Add the ability to remove or omit specific records from a found set 
	
	3.  	General
a)	Create the ability, like in old FMPro to move from record to record in a found set 	without going back and forth to a list of records. 
b)	The scroll feature needs work so that when you have scrolled down a list of 	records, selected and examined one record, and come back to the main screen,	 	you will go to the record you selected and not up to the top of the list as it 	currently is set.  [it is called Sticky Portal]
	c)	Ability to add text to modules/records
	d)	Link the status to the date field
	e)	Add Spell Check option so that it offers ability to add names, etc. so they don’t 			come up again and again. [This may be a standard feature in FMP 8+]
	f)	Make fields with pull down menus not modifiable
 
	4.  	CRADA Module
	a)	Program the amendments window to allow for page breaks and multi-page 			documents.
	b)	Make it easier to generate a CRADA amendment
	c)	The Amendment Form Header pulls from the same updated fields as the 				Clearance form, yet the information required for each is different.  Program so it 			pulls in the current information in its fields, not the new information being added 			via the amendment.  The latter should be captured in the body of the amendment. 
d)	When the months for a CRADA amendment extension are entered in the record, 	have the expiration date be automatically recalculated by the system.
e)	Appendix C Language Changes table searchable for each paragraph and ability to 	review the language.

	5.  	CTA Module

a)	Add Negotiator field and a specialist field in the CTA module as exists in all other 	agreement modules.

	6.  	AdOps Module 
		a)	Redesigned
	
	7.  	Extramural Invention Waivers 
		a)	Redesigned
	
	8.  	Letters and Memos
	a)	Have the ability to save modified letters for specific agreements within the 				agreement record in TIMS. [As a PDF file would be best.  This would be 				helpful in moving to a “document management system”.  Should also consider 			adding patent document to the EIR record, these document could include: OTT 			recommendation, original EIR, patent application, etc.]
b)	Have ability to print address labels from the contacts/org modules and to have the 	address merge into a letter.


9.	EIR Module

a)	Add Automatic Action item to generate a report if the future “Cost Sharing” 	button is added.
b)	Add ability to pull the issued patent from USPTO website.  This is relatively easy 	since there is a 	specific web-link for each Patent.  I am sure this could be applied 	to the published patent 	applications, including foreign patents and patent 	applications.  We just need the web-link 	information.
c)	Add ability to add post TRG items, similar to TRG Requests. This would help 	tracking the transactional development items in an EIR.

	10. 	Action Items

	a)	Move the Action Items toward an Agreement History, that is, remove the 				comments field and make every “comment” and Action Item a “History Item” 
b)	Certain action items should be a mandatory part of what we do (one year post 	provisional, 18 months post PCT filing, 3 months prior to CRADA expiration, 2 	months prior to CRADA LOI expiration).  TTB to decide what things need to be 	mandatory action items, then Colleen will need to program.
	
	11. 	Ability to set non-PHS/NIH contacts on Signatory List.  Currently the user can only designate PHS/NIH Contacts as “signatory”.  We need this function to identify a non-PHS/NIH Contact as signatory so their name appears on an agreement signature block.
	
	12.  	Create and store .pdf of agreement related documents 
	If standard NIH document with no modifications 
	then .pdf of signature page is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If standard NIH document with modifications 
	then .pdf of entire document is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If non-standard NIH document 
	then .pdf of entire document is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If printing an agreement, have the option to add a PDF file into TIMS (or specific location) See idea below (next bullet) for printing letter/memos/forms.
	(All scanned document are sent to a "default" location and stored so TIMS knows where to find them)
	
	13.  	Have a feature added which asks User "is this final?" when printing letter/memo/internal document. This would eliminate the multiple Automatic Action Items when documents (Letters/Memos/Forms are printed multiple times before the User is satisfied.
•	If yes, then --> 
	(a) TIMS generates an automatic .pdf, stores it in the record (allowing for retrieval/usage at later time) 
	(b) Generates automatic action item 
•	If no, then --> 
	(a) no .pdf file is generated or stored 
	(b) no automatic action is generated 
	14.  	Incorporate QC into the TIMS fields:
•	“Specialist” is filled in.
•	Status and Date fields match
&#61607;	If status is ‘active’ then execution date is completed
&#61607;	If status is ‘expired’ then expiration date has past
&#61607;	If status is ‘terminated’ then termination date is complete
&#61607;	If status is ‘withdrawn’ then withdrawn date is complete
•	For CRADAs make sure ‘Type’ is not empty
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then Abstract field is complete
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then term is not empty
•	CTAs if status is active, then ‘materials field is not empty
•	For EIRs NIH Reference number matches the appropriate type and status
•	For EIRs if the status is filed, then the filing date is not empty
•	For EIRs, if the type is EIR then the date received is complete
	15.  	Add a “sub-status” field to cover an EIR moving to Research Tool 
	16.  	Add a “Project” drawer, to track non-agreement projects.  The “Project” drawer would allow the User to ‘link’ to other agreements such that a Project could lead to an agreement. 
	17.  	Add ERROR message to MTA record if Material information (Developed under grant, Research of Human Subjects, 45 CFR Part 46 & Assurance number) are not filled out. Make this section stand out in the record (change text to red?)
	18.  	Re-design or re-word or if possible, get rid of error message created when TIMS is incorrectly exited by User.
	19.  	Add a field to MTAs for "Protocol Number".  In light of the new human subject assurance documentation, it would be helpful to have this field.

Statement of Work

Mailing and Shipping Solutions

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1  Organization

U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)
Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)
Office of Administration and Management
Management Services Division (MSD)
Facilities and Property Management Branch
1100 Wilson Boulevard
Arlington, VA 22209-3939

1.2  Mission

The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards as a means to eliminate fatal accidents; to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents; to minimize health hazards; and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the Nation's mines. MSHA carries out the mandates of the Mine Act at all mining and mineral processing operations in the United States, regardless of size, number of employees, commodity mined, or method of extraction.

1.3	Project Background

1.3.1	MSHA maintains over 100 field offices in 38 states and Puerto Rico. Offices vary in size from one person field duty stations to large district offices greater than 60 employees.  MSHA currently employs postage rate scales and meters in order to determine and affix postage to outgoing mail in most offices. When postage rates changed on January 8, 2006, MSHA discovered that its postage vendor would no longer provide updates for older postage rate scales, rendering them obsolete. Also, MSHA currently cannot track postage use and mail volume at the field office level without relying on employee surveys or questionnaires. 
MSHA desires to find a mailing and shipping solution that avoids planned obsolescence, provides detailed use information, and provides centralized billing for the various office locations. MSHA believes it can achieve this solution by replacing scale and meter technology with a Web based postage provider.
MSHA will acquire web based postage services through an RFP for a Base period of 1 year and four (4)1-year option periods.

SCOPE: The contractor shall provide all travel, plant, supervision, materials, design, and labor necessary to demolish 40 two-family housing units, located in the Bicentennial Military Family Housing area at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. 2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES: The work to be accomplished consists, in general, of the following principal items. This does not mean that the work consists only of these items. But, that it consists of these principal items along with all incidental minor work which becomes necessary to complete in order to accomplish the overall project in a satisfactory and workmanlike manner meeting the approval of the Contracting Officer. This incidental work is to be included in the Contractor’s estimate at the time of submittal to the Contracting Officer. a. Provide to the Contracting Officer prior to the commencement of work, any specific plans for actions not called for in this Statement of Work, specific differing procedures for actions called for already, and plans for removal of asbestos known to exist in the buildings to be demolished. Surveys for asbestos containing materials and lead-based paint are attached for the contractor’s use along with the Altus AFB standards for removal as part of a demolition project. Questions concerning Lead Based Paint or Asbestos in the units should be addressed to the 97th CES Environmental Flight. b. Assure that all utilities attached to the units are shut off prior to the start of the demolition work. Utility shutoff shall be coordinated between the contractor and the 97th Civil Engineering Squadron at Altus AFB. c. Demolish 40 duplex housing units located in Bicentennial Housing at Altus AFB, OK, some of which are two-story units. Demolition shall be accomplished using mechanical contrivances such as track-hoe, front end loader, bulldozer, or other similar equipment. Other acceptable practices are manual demolition by workmen, or mechanically assisted manual demolition. Under no circumstances may explosives be used for any part of the work. d. After demolition of the structure above the concrete slab foundations, the concrete slabs shall be demolished and hauled away. e. Contractor shall demolish and haul away all driveways leading to the units, as far as the sidewalks. If sidewalk is damaged in this process, it shall be replaced by the contractor as part of the work required by this project. e. The contractor shall have the option of salvaging any usable items from the structure prior to demolition. Examples of salvageable items may be light fixtures, water closets, lavatory sinks, cabinets, doors, etc. All salvaged items will become the property of the contractor. f. Prior to the general demolition, any required hazardous material remediation shall be accomplished. Any identified asbestos, lead-based paint, etc. shall be removed and properly disposed of before the bulk of demolition can proceed. g. Before demolition of air-conditioning units, or their removal, all refrigerants shall be removed from the units and captured in approved containers which meet all local, state, and federal rules, regulations, laws, etc., regarding capture and disposal of refrigerants. Contractor shall be responsible for disposal of any such refrigerants removed as part of this project. h. Debris generated by the demolition shall be removed from the worksite by the contractor and disposed of off base in an environmentally sound manner. All debris shall be cleaned up and hauled away from the site to a state-approved landfill or recycling center. i. Haul route(s) shall be as shown on the drawings. Other haul routes may be considered, but must be approved by the government before use by the contractor. If a temporary haul road is approved, it shall be built and maintained by the contractor during the performance period of the contract, and demolished by the contractor when no longer needed, and shall be built, operated, and demolished at no additional cost to the government. After the road would be demolished, the area where it is located shall be returned to its original state. j. Capping of Utilities: · Utilities shall be capped as follows: Sewer lines shall be capped at the wyes using plugs in the wyes, or the wyes removed and capped with a pipe cap. Water lines shall be capped with repair clamps at the mains. Gas shall be capped using sweated caps on copper lines, and PVC or matching caps on plastic lines. Electrical shall be removed up to the distribution transformer and disconnected at that point, and the conductor and conduit to the house removed. · After underground utility lines are removed, the contractor shall backfill the trenches/holes made by this removal and compact the soil removed and replaced by use of walk-behind or other mechanical vibratory compactor. It is the intent of the government to have the sites cleared of all utilities to a depth of three feet up to the point of termination of utilities to remain. · After backfill and compaction, the entire work area shall be leveled by use of a small grader or other such contrivance, to leave the area graded to match up with surrounding elevations and shall include any fine grading required to leave the finished area acceptable for the installation of sod while providing positive drainage to existing ditches, drains, etc. If imported fill dirt is required to maintain existing grade lines, the fill shall be provided by the contractor as part of the project and shall be free of foreign-debris and suitable for topsoil usage. k. After grading, the contractor shall establish new sod over all areas disturbed by the demolition. The contractor shall install sod over the entire cleared and graded area. Sodding shall be accomplished in accordance with the guidelines established in the publication, “Guideline Specifications to Turfgrass Sodding”, published by Turfgrass Producers International, 1855-A Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL. Of special interest to the government is that when the turf is established after all demolition is completed, the final profile of the work area shall be level without significant bumps, ridges, knolls, or other general surface irregularities. Sod shall not be left with projecting corners or edges lapped over adjoining strips of sod. Sod shall be placed level and rolled or otherwise worked to provide a relatively even surface after it is fully established and growing. For growth establishment, the contractor will be allowed use of government provided water from existing water lines and/or fire hydrants in the area to irrigate the new turf until it is fully established. The contractor shall be responsible for providing adapters, connectors, piping, hoses, and sprinklers necessary to irrigate the grass. l. The existing rented chain-link fencing around Bicentennial Housing shall remain in place for the duration of the demolition contract. The contractor may mount signs or other materials on the fence temporarily, but must remove any such items from the fence upon completion of his work. The fence gates used for access into and out of the demolition area shall be secured at the end of each workday to assure that children or other potential trespassers will not have access to the area. The demolition contractor is hereby notified that the government does not own this fence, and any damage to the fence caused by demolition activities will be the responsibility of the contractor to repair or pay the owner of the fence for repair or replacement. At his own option and expense, the demolition contractor may erect additional fencing for whatever reason he may deem necessary or may ask that the temporary fencing be removed so that he may provide his own construction fence. Any fencing, gates, or accessories installed as part of this contract shall be removed upon acceptable completion of the work and all holes/disturbed areas returned to their previous conditions. m. The contractor shall refer to UFGS 01572 Construction and Demolition Waste Management as the guide for requirements concerning recycling, reuse, and disposal of demolished or dismantled materials and equipment, and reporting on disposition of these items. Adherence to the requirements of UFGS 01572 in all its sections and subsections shall be considered as part of this project. The contractor may refer any and all questions pertaining to this specification to the Environmental Flight of 97th CES. 3. SPECIAL SCHEDULING: The demolition shall be so scheduled as to assure that the area encompassing Liberty Circle will be worked first. Demolition in this area must be completed first in order to allow for planned construction by the new Military Family Housing privatization contractor. It is highly recommended that sod operations begin as soon as an area is completed to allow for new sod to become established. A site visit is scheduled on 7 August 2006 at 10:00 A.M. CST. Only one site visit will be available for this project. Contact MSgt Anthony Overbay or MSgt Carl See by 4:00 P.M. by not later than 6 August 2006 4:00 p.m. CST if you plan on attending the site visit.

<SUBJECT>43 -- High-Throughput Roots Blower Stack Vacuum Pumping System

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions received for this RFQ and the Government's answers to those questions.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

--------------

Question 1: I need info on the gas being pumped.  It is mentioned that the system will be used to pump on liquid He-4 cryostats.  I believe that means the vacuum space of the cryostat only, not the He-4 itself.  Nowhere else does it mention the gas (including in the pumping speed requirement spec), so I assume it's only air.  But, just in case, I'd like to have confirmation rather than regrets. 
 
Answer 1: In the final application, the gases being pumped will be ambient atmosphere, nitrogen, and  Helium-4.  The pumping speed specification would ideally be for all three conditions; however, due to possible difficulties in evaluating pumping speed of Helium, the pumping speed specification is for "air."

Question 2: Is it acceptable to use the closest IP-rated enclosure (rather than NEMA 1)?  Is there a reason for specking NEMA-rated magnetic starters instead of IEC-rated starters?  That is, are these absolute specs or is there any room for alternates? 

Answer 2: NEMA or IEC rated starters are acceptable.

<DESC>A site visit was conducted on July 17, 2006, and contractors were instructed to provide questions by the close of business on July 18, 2006.  The questions and answers that resulted from this site visit are included below.  A revised Statement of Work will be provided via a separate, subsequent Amendment to this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Contractors must refer to the amended Statement of Work for changes to the requirement.

1.  Q: Has it been determined that all three displays will be mounted at the front of the room? A: Yes. 
2.  Q: Will the White boards be removed? Yes.  If so who is responsible for removing them? A: The Government will remove the white boards prior to installation of the audio visual equipment.
3.  Q: Where will the AV equipment Rack reside? A: The rack will be in one of front corners or in the closet. 
4.  Q: Will a new cable path be cut in the floor to the table to accommodate the new video and audio cables or will the vendor provide a cable bundle above the floor to a connection point at the wall?  A: No.  There are two options available: (1) routing cables from the table through the existing conduit pipe, up through the column, through the ceiling space, and down through the wall; and (2) routing cables from the table to the rack.   Per the amended statement of work, please provide pricing for both options.
5.  Q: Will all Video Teleconferencing (VTC) references be eliminated from the scope of work? A: Yes, please see updated Statement of Work
6.  Q: How many cable TV feeds will be required? A: The Government requires that two separate channels shall be viewed simultaneously on the three required plasma screens along with input from the computers located in the room.  At least two inputs (TV or SIPR/NIPR) must be viewable on each plasma at any given time.  A minimum of 6 separate inputs (2 per screen) must be viewable at one time.
7.  Q: How many computer feeds total will be required? (SIPR and NIPR)  A: In accordance with the amended statement of work, the existing 2 SIPR & 8 NIPR feeds must be capable of being viewed on the plasma screens.
8.  Q: Will the DDC allow SIPR and NIPR signals to pass through the same matrix switcher? Since a switcher does not retain information. A: Yes, this is permissible, but with a specific KVM switch…Cybex Switchview SC.  
9.  Q: What time frame will the PO be awarded after a vendor has been selected? A: The contracting office anticipates that an award will be made as soon as possible after receipt of offers and before the end of fiscal year FY06.
10.  Q: Will the government office hours be extended to include nights and weekends to accommodate the quick turn around time? A: It will be considered, please see the Statement of Work for amended delivery schedule.
11.  Q: Has it been determined that the final display technology will be Plasma (Available in 60+ inches, High maintenance, chance for image burn) or LCD (Only available in up to 50 inches, more costly, virtually no maintenance)? A: The requirement is three plasma screens as stated in the Statement of Work.
12.  Q: During the site visit, the computer connectivity at the conference table was specified as NIPR only, though the official solicitation specifies SIPR/NIPR.  Please stipulate the correct LAN connection for these machines. A:  The following existing LAN connections shall be fed to the audio visual system: 6 NIPR at the table, 2 NIPR from the side wall and 2 SIPR from the back wall.  
13.  Q: The desired delivery schedule is slated as desired 3-weeks ARO, required 4-weeks ARO.  As we are coming into a traditionally busy time of the year for AV dealers and manufacturers, we would like for you acknowledge understanding that forces beyond our control could affect the time schedule.  A:  The contractor shall provide the delivery schedule in which they can meet; however, the ability to meet the Government’s schedule is a factor that shall be evaluated.
14.  Q: Under government responsibililities:
The contractor shall provide the capability for the Command Control Center (CCC) to visually display on three separate contractor-provided and installed 60-inch (or larger) plasma monitors, information and or video from existing computer network systems, SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) systems and from an existing cable TV network.     Capability to display this information by these three plasma monitors must also include the ability to display multiple-source data into one plasma monitor simultaneously (minimum of two and maximum of four (quad) displays per monitor) and the ability to switch sources feeding these the monitors instantaneously.     It is anticipated that these plasma monitors would be located along the front wall where the current retractable projection screen is located.  Each monitor must also have audio capability (integrated or as a separate speaker system); the system must allow the operator to remotely select and broadcast audio for any one of the six (6) inputs that are displayed on the three plasma screens, but only one audio signal is required at any given time.
The contractor shall also interface existing four (4) LAN workstations in the conference room table the ability to feed information and have it displayed to the three plasma monitors. The overarching concept is that a laptop could be placed onto the conference room table and quickly and easily be ‘plugged’ into the audio visual system.   
The contractor will provide two audio/visual control systems.     One will be a movable desktop control panel, with the intention of it being used at the conference table, when needed. The second control system will be integrated with a portable podium. The podium should be easily movable (wheels or extremely light weight) and be of standard size and configuration. Both systems should be capable of operating independently or in tandem (simultaneously).       
Specific audio/video equipment recommended to be provided and installed by the contractor to achieve the required added functionality includes, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Three 60 inch plasma data display screens (or larger), with a minimum 1024x768 resolution, with depth dimension not to exceed 6 inches, capable of being wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted. Each monitor must also include audio output capability. 
2. Combination S-VHS Hi-Fi VCR/DVD player. Only special requirement for this equipment is that it can be stored properly in equipment rack also to be provided by the contractor.
3. Two portable video control panels.     One suitable for desktop mounting, the other to be part of a portable podium system. 
4. Portable podium with attached/installed video control panel.     Due to size of CCC Conference room, there is no need for a microphone with this podium.     The podium should be easily movable, either on wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration 
5. Equipment rack (if required), to house VCR/DVD player, switcher, and any other associated equipment.  The equipment rack shall be placed at one of the corners in the front of the room. 
6. Required interfaces, control system, remotes, power switches, switch boxes, cables, connectors and other mounting brackets to install all items identified above.
7. Required interfaces and hardware to support capability of integrating the existing computer network: six computer workstations at the conference room table, and the existing computer network workstations (NIPR and SIPR) to the audio visual system.  
8. One year warranty and preventive maintenance on entire audio visual system installed by the contractor.
9. Second year preventative maintenance. 
Contractor shall install the audio visual system.  Contractor shall test and align the system.     Labor and programming will include all on-site installation and wiring, coordination and supervision, testing, checkout and training.     Also includes all fabrication, modification, assembly, rack wiring and programming.

<DESC>The Statement of Work has been revised per the Site Visit conducted on 07/17/06, and the resulting Questions and Answers
that were posted as Amendment No. 3 on 08/04/06.  The revised Statement of Work follows herein.  The closing date for receipt of proposals remains as 4:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, August 16, 2006.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SP3100-6191-9502.     This requirement is set aside for small business; the associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334310 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.
The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement for a contractor to furnish and install an Audio/Visual Presentation System in the Command Control Center (CCC) Conference Room located in Building 81.     
Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the contract line items as follows: clin 0001, Equipment -- Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination, New Cumberland, PA); clin 0002, Installation of equipment; clin 0003, one year warranty and preventative maintenance; clin 0004 (optional), second year preventative maintenance.     NOTE: REQUIRED SCHEDULE FOR DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION IS OCTOBER 31, 2006.  INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT SHALL BEGIN ON OR AFTER OCTOBER 1, 2006.  THE DELIVERY DATE MAY BE SHIFTED TO A LATER DATE IF REQUIRED, AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO THE GOVERNMENT, IF CURRENT OPERATIONS DICTATE (I.E. PROVIDING HURRICANE RELIEF EFFORTS).  THE CONTRACTOR MUST BE ABLE TO BEGIN WORK NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 1, 2006.
The Scope of Work for this requirement is as follows:
The CCC conference room is approximately 28-feet long by 20-feet wide and is a SECURE ROOM (controlled access).     A 4-foot X 10-foot conference table and 10 chairs are positioned in the center of the room.     Current equipment in the room includes a white board with three separate sliding panels (to be removed by the Government prior to installation of the audio visual equipment); six computer desktop workstations located along two adjacent walls; a SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) communications (email) network system, linking the 6 computer workstations previously identified to their respective (SIPR/NIPR) Local Area Networks (LAN); a wall-mounted 19-inch television (which will need to be removed by the Contractor before installation of the new AV equipment) connected to a Cable TV network and a ceiling-mounted visual projector that faces a retractable projection screen along the same wall as the sliding dry-erase white boards noted above.    The audio/video display capability being requested in this SOW will supersede (replace) the need to utilize the current video projection and supporting retractable screen currently being employed in the CCC.     There are numerous power outlets throughout the space. The conference room has a standard 8-foot drop ceiling.     A schematic of the space is available from the Contract Specialist POC.
Government responsibilities:
1. Provide access to necessary areas to complete the project during normal business hours (0800 - 1700 M-F; after hours and weekend access may be granted if needed by the contractor)
2. Provide a safe and clean environment for contractor employees and their subcontractors.
3. Provide computer network system, both SECURE and NON-SECURE, to have video display equipment interfaced to.
4. Provide cable TV network to have video display equipment interfaced to.
5. Provide 110V power supply for the following equipment being installed by the contractor.

Contractor responsibities, could you add the requirement for the government to furnish and install required wiring trays for the conference table?  A: No.  The contractor is required to provide the necessary hardware for installation.
15.  Q: We understand that no VTC equipment is to be provided or interfaced to the system.  Is this true? A: Correct, no VTC equipment is required. 
16.  Q: Though the solicitation stipulates audio from each display, we would highly recommend a single sound system with a single speaker system.  Is this acceptable.  A: Yes, the system has to allow the operator to remotely select and broadcast audio for any one of the 6 input that are displayed on the 3 plasma screens.  However, only 1 audio signal is required at any one time 
17.  Q: During the survey, there was an indication that simultaneous display of four (4) Cable TV channels would be desired and that the tuners for these channels should be supplied and installed as part of this effort.  Is this an accurate statement? A: The Government’s requirement as found in the Statement of Work is to display a minimum of 2 CTV channels per screen, simultaneously, and the contractor must provide whatever hardware is necessary to satisfy this requirement.
18.  Q: Is your desired level of maintenance Preventive Maintenance only?  If not, please specify the extent of your desired maintenance level. A: As stated in the Statement of Work, pricing shall include a one year warranty for the system to include one year of preventative maintenance.  There is an optional contract line item for an additional year of preventative maintenance.
19.  Q: Based on the questions and tentative response during the site survey, you required 12 computer inputs and 6 video inputs.  Is this the extent of the physical simultaneously connected inputs required for your system?  A: There will be a total of 8 computer inputs (4 NIPR at the table, 2 NIPR from the side wall and 2 SIPR from the back wall) and 2 cable TV inputs per screen.  At least two inputs (TV or SIPR/NIPR) must be viewable on each plasma at any given time.  A total of 6 inputs must be viewable at one time.  
20.  Q: Is there an inventory of facility computers / other equipment which will be used in addition to the contract requirement? We need to know all equipment that made used in this room. A: No there is no inventory available. The SOW provides the requirement.
21.  Q: What video interfaces will the Computer workstations output? (HD15 VGA, DVI, and or dual output for either interface)  A: VGA
22.  Q: Will the NEC Projector be used in future applications? A: The NEC Projector is not included or tied into this current requirement.
23.  Q: Are there any limitations if the contractor implements wall-mount swing arm type mounts on the two corner locations?  A: Per the amended statement of work, the contractor is required to provide the installation plan
24.  Q: How many TV station channels need to be viewed simultaneously?  A: 6.  Minimum of two per screen.  
25.  Q: Is it regular CATV cable TV for the source or is it DSS satellite?  A: Regular CATV.

29.  Q: If the above is not possible, for the data extensions to the conference table, will the government be providing the switch ports for the contractor to “plug in to”? A: No
30.  Q: UPS necessary for settings/power conditioning?  A: Yes 
31.  Q: If it is determined that wall mounting the displays is the best solution, is the government responsible for additional supports to and behind the wall if necessary?  A: No
32.  Q: Please describe the size of touch panels the Government is seeking on the podium and on the conference table.  A common industry standard size is 10.5”.  Is this acceptable?  A: The contractor is required to provide information on the equipment with their proposal.  The Government will evaluate the equipment proposed at that time.
33. Q: Please describe the podium required.  I assume that smaller is better (as long as it accommodates the touch panel).  Please confirm?  A: The podium is described in the SOW. The contractor is required to provide information on the equipment with their proposal.  The Government will evaluate the equipment proposed at that time.
34. Q: The existing table already has significant cabling installed in the cable tray.  Please confirm whether you want the computer connections to be installed as cable or wall plates?  If wall plates please provide a picture of the existing wall plate connections in the cable tray and the make/model of the table manufacturer so that we can ensure that our solution will work.  A: As stated in the amended statement of work, the contractor need only provide connection from the existing computer connections to the Audio Visual equipment.  The contractor shall submit an installation plan as part of their offer.
35.  Q: The bid calls for NIPR and SIPR network connections at the table.  Please confirm that the SIPR connections are no longer required.  A: Please review the amended SOW.  The existing 4 NIPR at the table, 2 NIPR from the side wall and 2 SIPR from the back wall, must be input into the audio visual system.  
 36.  Q: Please confirm that the NIPR connection can be accomplished by adding a network switch at the table to example on the one NIPR connection that is already present. A: There are already 2 NIPR and 2 SIPR computers in the room on the side and back wall.  The requirement for the existing computers is that their screens/input can be displayed on the plasma screens.  No additional SIPR or NIPR connections are required at the table.   As there are currently LAN connections inside the table, there is no requirement for a switch.  Please refer to the amended SOW for the updated requirement.
37.  Q: Would you like “whiteboard” capability in the control system? (The ability to draw on a touch screen and display it on any monitor/window) A: No
38.  Q: Just to clarify where will the podium and Rack be placed in the room? A: As stated in the SOW, the podium is required to be mobile.  The rack will be in one of front corners or in the closet.
39.  Q: If not what will the government provide to hide the cables? (i.e. channeling the floor/adding a raised floor to the room) A: The gov't will not provide anything.  The contractor should route the cable through existing conduit, in existing floor channels, in the ceiling, in walls, or in wall conduit provided by the contractor.
40.  Q: (If floor will be channeled and conduit will be provided, recommend no smaller than 3” conduit, preferably 4”-5”) A: No additional channeling will be provided.  
41.  Q; Are you requiring audio and video hookups at the conference table? A: Please provide hardware necessary to accomplish the requirement(s) as outlined in the SOW.
