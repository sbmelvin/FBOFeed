<DESC>The U.S. Army, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 66027 intends to negotiate a sole-source purchase order AudioCARE INC for expanded service of their patient appointment reminder system.  Right now they use AudioCARE for an automated phone call patient appointment reminder.  The requirement going forward will be the addition of a text message reminder.  Patients will have the option for either the phone call or the text message.  Not only must AudioCARE provide the text and call service but they have to be compatable with the software that is currently in place in the Army Health Care system (CHCS and AHLTA).  Research indicates that there is no other company that can provide these services and interface with these systems. <br>  <br> This is a sole source procurement under Acquisition of Commercial Items (FAR 12), and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES, however; any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Office by 1600 Central Time on 9 JAN 14.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed above.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source procurement.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Daniel.Gustke@us.army.mil.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.    <br>

<DESC>The DARPA Fold F(x) program objective is to develop processes enabling the rapid synthesis, screening, sequencing and scale-up of folded, non-natural, sequence-defined polymers with expanded functionality. The program will specifically address the development of non-natural affinity reagents that can bind and respond to a selected target, as well as catalytic systems that can either synthesize or degrade a desired target. DARPA anticipates that successful efforts will include (1) novel synthetic approaches that yield large libraries (&gt;109 members) of non-natural sequence-defined polymers; (2) flexible screening strategies that enable the selection of high affinity/specificity binders and high activity/selectivity catalysts from the non-natural libraries; (3) demonstration that the screening approach can rapidly (&lt;4 days) yield affinity reagents or catalysts against targets of interest to the DoD; and (4) demonstration of scalability and transferability to the DoD scientific community.<br /><br />See attached DARPA-BAA-14-13.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to award Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services. The scope includes design and construction efforts using Design Build (DB) and Design Bid Build (DBB) delivery methods for a broad range of general construction projects including but not limited to new construction; renovation; repair and alteration; demolition; and historical restoration of GSA owned or leased real property in the state of Washington including (but not exclusive to) the cities of Seattle, Auburn, Tacoma, Blaine, and Lynden. Types of facilities may include, but are not limited to administrative buildings, courthouses, child care centers, warehouses, and land of port entry. This will be a firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a base period of 365 calendar days and four one-year options.
<p>GSA reserves the right to award multiple contracts in each major city.</p>
<p>The solicitation for the MATOC will be restricted to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses serviced by the Small Business Administration Seattle District Office. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers. The acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15, Negotiated Procurement using the Best Value Trade-off Source Selection Technique. The government will consider past performance, technical factors and price as the basis for selecting awardees. The government anticipates awarding up to five (5) contracts to those firms whose proposals are determined to be the most beneficial to the government. Subsequent (individual) task orders will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505 - Ordering, and in accordance with the task order terms and conditions including the designated Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Individual task orders awarded against the MATOC will be competed among other IDIQ awardees and will vary in anticipated size ranging from a minimum of $2,000.00 to maximum of $2,729,000.00 (current prospectus level). The average size of projects ranges from $200,000 to $300,000. The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) of the MATOC over the five year contract period is $20,000,000.00. There is no MOL per year.</p>
<p>GSA intends to issue all documents to include the initial solicitation, amendments, clarifications letters and other applicable documents electronically. Offerors are solely responsible for obtaining solicitation documents from the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website http://www.fbo.gov). Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.</p>
<p>Offerors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM), formerly known as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), in order to be eligible to receive an award from this solicitation. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />If submitting as a joint venture, the joint venture entity must be registered in SAM in order to be eligible to receive an award from this solicitation.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The small business size standard for this code is $33.5 Million in average revenue over the past three (3) years.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about January 23, 2014. The closing date for receipt of proposal submissions will be specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP). GSA will not maintain a manual list of interested firms. Prospective contractors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for any changes or updates. It is highly recommended that, while viewing this synopsis on FedBizOpps, contractors register in FedBizOpps as interested vendors and register to receive notification of updates.</p>
<p>Important Notice: Prior to submitting a proposal under this SDVOSB set-aside solicitation; offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.</p>

For this acquisition, CEHNC proposes to award Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC)/ Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is anticipated that a RFP will be issued approximately 15 days after the release of this announcement.   <br>  <br> A pre-proposal conference is being planned for one day during the week of 27 - 31 January 2014.  Conference details will be posted with the RFP release, which is currently projected to be 21 January 2014. <br>  <br> CEHNC is seeking contractors to provide services for the procurement and installation of UMCS, Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems (to include chillers, boilers, air handling units and ductwork systems installation and/or integration), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Fire Alarm Systems (FAS), life safety control systems, chemical / biological / radiological contaminant detection / filtration, utilities (electric/gas/water) metering and Electronic Security Systems (ESS) worldwide.   <br>  <br> UMCS contractors are to provide a comprehensive and a holistic range of services with the following benefits:  <br>  <br>  	Provide high-quality equipment, timely services, and professional project management for UMCS <br>  	Perform infrastructure improvements to enhance mission support <br>  	Create healthier, safer working and living environments <br>  	Apply practical contract and procurement processes to ensure project implementation <br>  	Provide expert, objective technical support including: project facilitators, and advanced technology experts <br>  	Facilitate smart project management that ensures building efficiency improvements with the new equipment  <br>  	Implement large and small facility improvements that provide immediate savings <br>  	Ensure energy and related operation and maintenance cost savings <br>  	Assure maintenance and repair when included as part of contract <br>  	Enhance the ability to plan and budget energy, operation, and maintenance activities at the facility level <br>  	Curtail the budget impact of rising or volatile energy prices        <br>  <br> UMCS encompasses a wide array of energy management and building automation systems, which employ hardware and software to affect energy, manpower, equipment and management savings.  Energy savings is accomplished through monitoring and providing control and/or control overrides for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as well as for lighting and central plant equipment.  Manpower savings are accomplished by remotely monitoring and controlling equipment, meters, or systems which would otherwise require periodic visual observation.  Equipment savings is accomplished by early detection of equipment failure or reductions in equipment performance levels. The UMCS may also be used to assist in building and maintenance management.  Management savings are achieved through  quote mark Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition quote mark  or  quote mark SCADA quote mark  which refers to centralized systems that monitor and control electrical distribution systems and other utilities for entire sites, or complexes of systems spread out over large areas.  These savings are delivered through contracts with private contractors that specialize in procurement and installation of UMCS. <br>  <br> UMCS services will be provided throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), to include the District of Columbia and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) including Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, U.S. Territories and possessions, locations with named contingency operations, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Japan & Okinawa, Malaysia, Qatar, Kuwait, Saipan, South Korea and Turkey.  Small business offerors are not required to have OCONUS experience. <br>  <br> The UMCS IV MATOC ID/IQ contract will have an ordering period of five years (three (3) year base period and two (2) option periods of one (1) year each) with an estimated total value of $2.5 billion.  An unrestricted suite of contracts, with $500 million of the awards set aside for small business concerns, is planned as a result of the market research.  The government reserves the right to increase the set aside threshold above $500 million.  Detailed ordering procedures will be included in the solicitation to specify the circumstances for reserving a task order for small businesses.  The intent is to award contracts to the most highly qualified and responsible offerors, both large and small businesses, that offer the Best Value to the Government.   <br>  <br> This contract will be for predominantly for services but will have construction and supply elements.  The subsequent contracts will each include the necessary clauses, terms, conditions, instructions, and references attendant to each of these three unique contract styles.  Based upon the requirements for each task order, these MATOCs will thus include the flexibility to adapt to the form required by tailoring the mix of clauses (construction, service or supply) to mitigate risk.  The contract structure will offer the flexibility to meet the various demands without sacrificing the rigor necessary to satisfy fiscal and legislative mandates, all while delivering the best business deal.  <br>  <br> For this acquisition, Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) is the primary contract type for 95% of projects with Cost Reimbursement (CR) and Time & Materials (T&M) task orders being employed for the remaining 5% of requirements.  The goal is to use FFP task orders for the majority of projects; however, on occasion, it may not be possible to estimate, with any reasonable degree of confidence, the costs associated with a task (project).  Each project has its own unique requirements.  Some project sites have existing security and/or utility controls systems that require evaluation and/or upgrade, while other sites may have no systems at all.  For projects with more challenging scenarios, a Cost Reimbursement or Time and Materials task order may be used to perform the type requirements.   <br>  <br> Under each contract, task orders may be awarded as Firm Fixed-Price, Time & Materials, Cost Reimbursement or some combination of the aforementioned contract types.  Most task orders will be subject to the Services Contract Act (SCA).  Task orders that include some construction efforts may also be subject to the Davis Bacon Act (DBA). <br>  <br> The RFP will be available electronically at https://www.fbo.gov.  <br>  <br> The POC for this acquisition is undersigned. <br>  <br> Martin Bushey <br> Contracting Specialist, Huntsville Center  <br> Directorate of Contracting <br> Voice: (256) 895-1119 <br> FAX: (256) 895-1197 <br> Email: martin.bushey@usace.army.mil <br>  <br>   <br>

<p>The 96th Test Wing (TW), Air Force Test Center (AFTC), Eglin AFB, Florida intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Zodiac Data Systems Inc., 11800 Amber Park Dr Ste 140, Alpharetta, GA 30009-2269, to provide technical engineering support and spare parts, and to repair, refurbish, and upgrade Airborne Data Recorders (ADRs) in the existing inventory. Inventory consists of the following legacy ADRs: Model D200, Model D5000, Model D7000, Model MDR, and Model VS1500. These ADRs are owned and maintained by AFTC and are in support of Department of Defense developmental and operational flight test requirements related to a variety of weapon system platforms. The incumbent contractor developed the software and hardware for these systems, and the software/hardware and test data for the systems are proprietary. The Air Force has no development funding for this procurement. Spare components will be procured using RDT&amp;E and Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding. Requirements are described in the DRAFT PWS attached.</p>

They do not meet a typical training barracks 2+2 configuration. The barracks are sub-standard; do not provide sufficient square footage. The barracks is also deficient in required power, communications, security and utilities. Ventilation is not in compliance with building codes and mold exists in the barracks presenting a continual health risk to the Cadets. The current barracks does not provide enough female latrines to accommodate the 16% female population. <br> The current HVAC, fire suppression, and infrastructure deficiencies negatively impact the health and security and safety of the Cadets. There is no air conditioning in the barracks. The current infrastructure will require substantial upgrades to meet current health, safety and security codes and requirements. <br>  <br>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Delta Cross Channel (DCC) gates are generally open from June to October bringing fresh water from the Sacramento River into the south Delta via forks of the Mokelumne to maintain salinity standards at the Central Valley Project and State Water Project export pumps.&nbsp; The open DCC gates and the heavy Sacramento flows create a problem for adult Mokelumne River origin fall-run Chinook salmon which are attempting to return to the main stem Mokelumne.&nbsp; With the gates open, there is a clear pathway for the salmon migrating upstream to stray into the Sacramento River system, and particularly the Sacramento River.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This work to be performed under this contract involves the design, manufacture, installation, and performance testing of an electrical barrier capable of redirecting upstream migrating salmon towards the Mokelumne River, that can be removed after the upstream migration ends.&nbsp; The system must not represent a hazard to human health, negatively impact the salmonid populations, negatively impact non-salmonid fish species, or negatively impact wildlife that may enter the water in the vicinity.&nbsp; The installation of the barrier must not adversely impact water supplies nor require changes to the Operations Criteria and Plan.&nbsp; Implementation must not conflict with any currently enforced Reasonable and Prudent Alternative.</p>

<SUBJECT>10 Kilowatt Laser Workstation for Laser Materials Processing
<SOLNBR>NISTAMDBLDR-NB686010-14-172014
<RESPDATE>012414
<CONTACT>Paul Pierson, Phone 3034975270, Email paul.pierson@nist.gov - Robert Brackett, Phone 3034976320, Email robert.brackett@nist.gov
<DESC>NIST is a world leader in calibration services to support lasers and laser-related processes. A key to the success of this program is access to high power laser sources. Currently, NIST has a 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13 fiber laser. To meet the needs of its customers, NIST is undertaking an ambitious program to understand the fundamental laser-material processes that occur during laser welding. To meet these needs, NIST needs a laser workstation that integrates its existing 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13 fiber laser with an industrial laser welding held with high-accuracy three-dimensional motion control within a Class 1 laser enclosure. The output laser power must be tunable over the range from 20 % to 100 % of maximum output power. Laser beam divergence must be less than 2 mrad over a minimum distance of 5 m. In addition, the laser source must be capable of operation in both continuous wave mode as well as modulated mode with a pulse repetition frequency up to 15 kHz or greater to take full advantage of the dynamic range of the laser power standards in the Laser Radiometry Project. The only known commercial technology for meeting these requirements is high power fiber laser technology.
<p>The system shall meet or exceed the following technical specifications:</p>
<p><br />NIST requires a 10 Kilowatt laser workstation to support metrology for laser materials processing. This workstation is a critical part of an ongoing research program in laser materials processing. We require a workstation that is capable of both production and prototype use. We require a vendor who has the technical expertise to provide ongoing support of this tool for our research program with the ability to perform modifications to the workstation at a later date. In addition, the vendor must be able to show they have the technical expertise to accommodate future modifications to the laser workstation that are not currently available. At this time, IPG Photonics is the only known vendor that meets all of the technical specifications and has the technical expertise to accommodate future modifications to the laser workstation that are currently available. Furthermore, IPG Photonics is the only known vendor who can integrate our existing fiber laser (model number 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13) with the laser welding head without violating the warranty on our existing fiber laser. NIST has undertaken a significant market research effort in search of a 10 kilowatt laser workstation. Based on that research, IPG Photonics was the only company determined to be capable of performing the integration of the laser welding head and existing NIST fiber laser without violating the warranty on the NIST fiber laser.</p>
<p>1. Existing Commercial Products<br />Equipment shall be a current year production model and not a prototype or one-of-a-kind system. There shall be at least 10 working units similar to the proposed make and model operating currently in the field. This workstation is a critical part of an ongoing research program in laser materials processing. We require a workstation that is capable of both production and prototype use. We require a vendor who has the technical expertise to provide ongoing support of this tool for our research program with the ability to perform modifications to the workstation at a later date. In addition, the vendor must be able to show they have the technical expertise to accommodate future modifications to the laser workstation that are not currently available. Any substitutions of normally used major system components, such as power-supplies, coolers, and optics equipment required to meet these specifications shall be clearly noted in the proposal. The offeror's response shall identify specifically the number of tools of the same make and model to the one proposed which have been delivered in the prior 18 months.</p>
<p>2. Physical Specifications<br />Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) 10 Kilowatt Laser Workstation for Laser Materials Processing. The quoted system/solution must meet or exceed all of the minimum specifications identified herein.</p>
<p>Footprint and installation environment and testing<br />All equipment, excluding the rough vacuum pumps, chillers, electronics and ancillary equipment not requiring operator access, shall be required to fit on a 9foot high by 6 foot wide by 7 foot deep volume so that it will fit into our lab with existing equipment. Bid responses must include system dimensions and required clearances. Requirements for house facilities, such as process gases, coolants and vacuum lines shall be explicitly stated. Each component of the system shall have internal electrical distribution and require only a single connection to a 110 V 30 amp or 208 single-phase connection per system. All non-cryogenic cooling of system components will be done, preferably, with water chillers employing thermo-electric removal of heat. The system will be installed in a temperature-controlled laboratory. All specifications laid out in this document are required to be met under these conditions. To minimize impact of the installation on on-going research in the lab, the complete system must be built and tested as one complete unit at the manufacturer's site, to ensure that performance specifications are met, before installation.</p>
<p>System Architecture<br />After extensive market research, we have determined that only one specific system architecture for a laser workstation shall meet the needs of our project. This system shall be able to integrate our existing 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13 fiber laser and capable of both prototype and production laser welding and cutting. This system will include high-accuracy motion control in three-dimensions. There workspace dimensions must be at least 500 mm by 500 mm by 200 mm in volume. There should be a CCD camera for live viewing of laser welding and cutting process. This laser workstation is a critical component of the NIST Laser Materials Processing program. As such, we require ongoing technical support as well as the ability to modify the workstation to meet future production and prototyping research tasks. The supplier must have the necessary technical expertise to accommodate these modifications that are not available with current technology. For safety purposes, the laser workstation enclosure must meet the requirements of a Class 1 laser enclosure.</p>
<p>3. Functional Specifications</p>
<p>Performance<br />The laser workstation shall meet all of the following performance requirements.</p>
<p>a. Class 1 laser enclosure suitable for operation with a 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13 fiber laser.<br />b. High-accuracy motion control of for laser welding and cutting in three-dimensions.

The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting. The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation and demonstration of performance specifications, but no later than 30 days after installation.</p>
<p>Warranty, Installation and Service<br />Systems warranty shall be for a period of not less than one year beginning at on-site acceptance. Warranty shall include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation. This warranty shall cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period. These systems are scheduled for ultimate installation in early 2014 in a building currently under construction at the NIST Boulder site. Given this situation, offerors should be cognizant of the fact that some time may elapse between delivery of the systems, installation on site, and commencement of the warranty period. NIST will consider proposals for "delivery in place" of the systems at the offeror's facility prior to installation. In no case, however, will the warranty period begin prior to on-site acceptance at NIST. This requirement shall supersede any of the offeror's standard terms and conditions. Preferences will be given to longer warranty periods.</p>
<p>To minimize our expenses in case of need for service, the laser manufacturer must have North America-based service personnel, and the system purchase must include a guarantee of service support on-site within 1 week during the warranty period.</p>

<DESC>A mudslide triggered by Hurricane Ivan's storm surge toppled a platform at Mississippi Canyon (MC) Lease Block 20. The platform's wells were covered by more than 100 feet of mud and sediment and as a result of structural damage, plumes containing crude oil and gas discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, creating a sheen on the surface of the water. To mitigate the discharge, in 2009, a subsurface containment system was installed at the MC 20 site, however, there continues to be a visible crude oil sheen on the surface of the water daily. The subsea containment system consists of: three 2700 cubic foot (100barrel capacity) steel domes, hoses, a marker buoy and a 50 barrel oil/water separator. U.S. Coast Guard administrative order 12-001 directed the Platform Owner to begin the design a new pollution dome system that is suitable for the environmental conditions found at the MC20 discharge site. The dome system is located at Mississippi Canyon Lease Block 20, south of New Orleans, LA (approximately 12 miles from shore), centered at 28 degrees 56' 12.619" and 088 degrees 58' 10.303" W. The water depth is approximately 440 feet. An engineering consultant is required to assist the USCG by evaluating and making recommendations to modify, re-design and/or un-install the current subsea containment system at MC 20 and also review new proposed containment system to eliminate the ongoing&nbsp;sheen and recover product.&nbsp;The USCG requires an engineering consultant to assist with an independent government assessment on the effectiveness of a new dome system. This assessment requires unique skills and capabilities related to hydrocarbon emissions through fine grained sediments, as well as marine structure engineering and the underlying physical processes associated with natural hydrocarbon seepage; skills not currently available within the U.S. Coast Guard. The contractor shall meet the following requirements: 1.Expertise in seabed flux measurements of oil and gas from natural and anthropogenic sources. 2. Expertise in analyzing temporal and spatial variability in seabed emissions. 3. Expertise in design, implementation, and failure modes of containment systems for collecting oil and gas at the seabed 4. Expertise in geologic controls on variability in emissions. 5. Expertise in oil volumetric estimation on the sea surface and in oil slick processes affecting oil slicks on the sea surface. 6. Expertise in modeling the fate of oil and gas droplets in the water column - a key factor to containment system design.&nbsp;

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Trulink Wireless Intercommunication System for the use on the C-17, KC-135, C-130, C-5, and the KC-10 aircraft. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334290. Size standard is 500 employees. <br />The proposed source is Telephonics Corporation, 815 Broad Hollow RD, Farmingdale, NY 11735-3904. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires Trulink Wireless intercommunication system for the use on the C-17, KC-135, C-130, C-5, and the KC-10 aircraft. Telephonics is the only known source for this system which is required by the Air Force per AFI 10-2909, Chapter 5.11. <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD.

<DESC>Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), Fort Gordon, GA intends to negotiate/award a sole source contract with Motorola.  The requirement is for the purchase of APX7500 Dual Band Mid Power Mic total of 4 10-40W UHF R1 380-420 MHZ XTL 5000 C total 1 and Accessory Equipment and consumable supplies.  The NAICS code is 334220. The authority for this non-competitive award is 10 USC 2304c(1), Only one responsible source.  The Government intends to procure this sole source requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in FAR part 13 and Commercial procedures in FAR part 12.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS and a solicitation will not be issued.

If no affirmative written response is received by 0800 a.m. on 08 January 2014 to patricia.a.early10.civ@mail.mil , an award will be made without further notice.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>  <br> SPECIFICATIONS: <br> The current EMS radio communication system has three primary purposes:  EMS to EMS communications, EMS to hospital communications and Hospital to Hospital communications.  Current HEAR system has stopped working and is well beyond ifs life expectancy. Presently, Ambulance Service does not meet Installation Emergency Management Evacuation or local hospitals.  Department of Emergency Medicine is unable to receive urgent calls regarding life threatening emergencies, or to communicate with local agencies during MASCAL events except through land line which is suboptimal.  The EMS is requesting the APX7500 because they are dual band radios with UHF and VHF.  UHF bands allow communication with Fire and Police Departments and Control Center at Fort Gordon.  LMR land based radios are utilized on all military installation allowing communication with other posts.  VHF band works with the HEAR/911 system.  Ambulances leaving post to travel to another hospital can communicate directly with that hospital.  Current system due to age only allows third party calls in this situation is relayed via a dispatcher which is suboptimal.  The APX7500 is the only dual band available that allows UHF and VHF capability.  Market research revealed that the APX7500 is the updated version of our HEAR system and will place DDEAMC and its EMS Service in total compliance with the local Emergency Management and MASCAL plans. <br>  <br>  <br>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black">FSIS is the agency of USDA that is delegated the authority to exercise the functions of the Secretary of Agriculture as provided in the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451, et seq.), and the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA) (21 U.S.C. 1031-1056). These statutes provide that FSIS is to protect the public by ensuring that meat, poultry, and egg products are safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packaged. Minimizing the public health impacts from contaminated foods requires rapid government response and intervention, which in turn requires that threats be identified as quickly and as definitively as possible and addressed.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black">By virtue of its food safety responsibilities and its presence in so many plants, FSIS depends upon a large, geographically disbursed workforce to inspect the Nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FSIS provides inspection functions at approximately 6,000 plants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FSIS also operates three laboratories. In all, the Agency employs approximately 10,000 people, of which 4,026 are field employees supporting the plant inspection role and 270 work at the laboratories. The plants and laboratories are located throughout the U.S. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

At present, the inspection personnel record their time on paper forms, and submit them via fax to the FSIS Financial Processing Center. The goal is to replace the current method with an electronic time reporting solution that can be deployed on-site at approximately 6,000 food inspection establishments/plants throughout the U.S. </span></p>

The solution should include a means of inputting data (i.e. key pad), imbedded software for collecting/recording the data, data storage capability, and connectivity to transmit the data to FSIS's time and attendance system, Kronos<sup>&copy;</sup> Time and Attendance system (WebTA). </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">The time reporting solution components shall consist of an input device with a display screen readable by the user and a method for the user to key in data which will be used by employees to record their work time. The solution should also include embedded software for collecting/recording the data, data storage capability to store time accounting information for a minimum of two pay periods (30-days), should the connection be lost the ability to synch the data entered from the last successful connection when communications are reestablished, and connectivity to transmit the data to FSIS Kronos WebTA system. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">The solution implemented must comply with the plant and <span style="COLOR: black">laboratory</span> environments where installed and support both analog and digital transmission mediums. </span></p>

<p>5352.201-9101 Ombudsman</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br />Wide-Area Work Flow (WAWF) Instructions<br />1. All vendors/contractors must utilize the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system for certification and payment of invoices. Please note that various codes need to be identified on the contract award document (SF 1449) before entering data in the WAWF system. These codes function like zip codes and will route our invoice to the proper destinations for certification and payment. The following is a summary of the codes, (DoDAAC is Department of Defense Activity Address Code).</p>
<p>a. CAGE Code - identifies contractor information (may be found in block 17a)<br />b. Admin/Issued By DoDAAC: FA4800 - identifies the administering Contracting Office - ACC CONS (may be found in block 9, "Issued by"). <br />c. Inspected By/Ship To/Deliver To DoDAAC: F2QF07 - identifies Inspected By &amp; Ship To &amp; Delivery To DoDAACs. Leave the EXT block blank.<br />d. Pay DoDAAC: F67100 - identifies paying office, DFAS Limestone (may be found in block 18(a), "Payment will be made by").</p>
<p>2. The WAWF system will ask for additional information not previously required for invoicing which includes:</p>
<p>a. Inspection/Acceptance Points on the "Create New Document Screen" in WAWF: Mark D for Destination in both Inspection and Acceptance.<br />b. Shipment Number/Shipment Date: In WAWF under the "Header" tab of the Create New Document Screen you will find a shipment number and shipment date block. We recommend the shipment number entered be sequential beginning with each fiscal year (i.e. invoice for Oct would be shipment 1, invoice for Nov would be shipment 2, and so on) and shipment date may be date of invoice.<br />c. Stock Number: Type N/A in this space<br />d. Type: FT (for commodities), SVS (for services), etc</p>
<p>3. Contractors must prepare a combination invoice/receiving report electronically in WAWF. This will enable the invoice to be routed to DFAS at the same time the receiving report is routed to the customer (ACC DP), or as stated in the order for certification.</p>
<p>4. Invoices for cost reimbursable CLINS (i.e. Travel Costs) may also be submitted via WAWF, however, supporting documentation to validate costs billed must be electronically sent to 633 CONS/LGCA and customer stated in Delivery Order.</p>
<p>5. 633 CONS/LGCA will continue to serve as the liaison for payment issues. While we will no longer approve invoices, we will be able to monitor payment actions. Any questions regarding WAWF should first be directed to the Contract Manager or Contracting Officer to be resolved.</p>
<p>6. Contractor shall submit an email notification to the contract manager once an invoice/receiving report has been put into WAWF so that he/she can monitor payment action. After you have completed processing the invoice within WAWF you will be taken to a screen showing who is receiving email notification from WAWF. On this screen you will see a line stating Add Additional Email Notification. This allows you the opportunity to type in an email address. Once you have typed this address the persons name will stay with the contract until completion so you will not have to retype this name each time you input a new invoice. This person will receive an email notification each time you input an invoice against this contract.</p>

<DESC>This solicitation is a sole source acquisition notice for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for STAR-CMM+ Licenses.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contractor shall not, without the prior written permission of the Contracting Officer, incorporate in data delivered under this contract any data not first produced in the performance of this contract unless the Contractor- <br />(i) Identifies the data; and <br />(ii) Grants to the Government, or acquires on its behalf, a license of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or, if such data are restricted computer software, the Government shall acquire a copyright license as set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of this clause (if included in this contract) or as otherwise provided in a collateral agreement incorporated in or made part of this contract. <br />(3) Removal of copyright notices. The Government will not remove any authorized copyright notices placed on data pursuant to this paragraph (c), and will include such notices on all reproductions of the data. <br />(d) Release, publication, and use of data. The Contractor shall have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, except- <br />(1) As prohibited by Federal law or regulation (e.g., export control or national security laws or regulations); <br />(2) As expressly set forth in this contract; or <br />(3) If the Contractor receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of this contract that contain restrictive markings, the Contractor shall treat the data in accordance with such markings unless specifically authorized otherwise in writing by the Contracting Officer. <br />(e) Unauthorized marking of data. <br />(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract concerning inspection or acceptance, if any data delivered under this contract are marked with the notices specified in paragraph (g)(3) or (g) (4) if included in this clause, and use of the notices is not authorized by this clause, or if the data bears any other restrictive or limiting markings not authorized by this contract, the Contracting Officer may at any time either return the data to the Contractor, or cancel or ignore the markings. However, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253d, the following procedures shall apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings. <br />(i) The Contracting Officer will make written inquiry to the Contractor affording the Contractor 60 days from receipt of the inquiry to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings; <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to respond or fails to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the 60-day period (or a longer time approved in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown), the Government shall have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions. <br />(iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor will be so notified in writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the head of the contracting activity, that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer will furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's decision. The Government will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination becoming final (in which instance the Government will thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed. <br />(2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request thereunder. <br />(3) Except to the extent the Government's action occurs as the result of final disposition of the matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Contractor is not precluded by paragraph (e) of the clause from bringing a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, that may arise as the result of the Government removing or ignoring authorized markings on data delivered under this contract. <br />(f) Omitted or incorrect markings. <br />(1) Data delivered to the Government without any restrictive markings shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. The Government is not liable for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data. <br />(2) If the unmarked data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Contractor may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer in writing for good cause shown) after delivery of the data, permission to have authorized notices placed on the data at the Contractor's expense. The Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Contractor- <br />(i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied; <br />(ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent; <br />(iii) Establishes that the proposed notice is authorized; and <br />(iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any data made prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice. <br />(3) If data has been marked with an incorrect notice, the Contracting Officer may- <br />(i) Permit correction of the notice at the Contractor's expense if the Contractor identifies the data and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized; or <br />(ii) Correct any incorrect notices. <br />(g) Protection of limited rights data and restricted computer software. <br />(1) The Contractor may withhold from delivery qualifying limited rights data or restricted computer software that are not data identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause. As a condition to this withholding, the Contractor shall- <br />(i) Identify the data being withheld; and <br />(ii) Furnish form, fit, and function data instead. <br />(2) Limited rights data that are formatted as a computer database for delivery to the Government shall be treated as limited rights data and not restricted computer software. <br />(3) [Reserved] <br />(h) Subcontracting. The Contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government under this contract. If a subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government those rights, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the refusal and shall not proceed with the subcontract award without authorization in writing from the Contracting Officer. <br />(i) Relationship to patents or other rights. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government. <br />(End of clause) <br />Contracting Officer's Representative</p>

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
 The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br />January 7, 2014<br /> <br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />January 30, 2014
<p>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report assessing weaknesses of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). The report will identify and assess weaknesses in the PLA's organization and human capital; the PLA's combat capabilities in the land, air, maritime, space, and electromagnetic domains; and China's defense industries (research and development and production). The report will assess how these weaknesses impact the PLA's combat capabilities and its ability to achieve its missions. The report also will make recommendations for how an opponent could exploit these weaknesses.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION.  <br />The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in 22 U.S.C. 7002), which states that "The Commission...shall investigate and report ... on...</p>
<p>"REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND SECURITY IMPACTS-The triangular economic and security relationship among the United States, Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China (including the military modernization and force deployments of the People's Republic of China aimed at Taiwan), the national budget of the People's Republic of China, and the fiscal strength of the People's Republic of China in relation to internal instability in the People's Republic of China and the likelihood of the externalization of problems arising from such internal instability..."</p>
<p>ABOUT PROPOSALS.  <br />The Commission solicits proposals from organizations and individuals capable of providing a one-time unclassified report assessing weaknesses of the PLA. The report will identify and assess the weaknesses in the PLA's organization and human capital; the PLA's combat capabilities in the land, air, maritime, space, and electromagnetic domains; and China's defense industries (research and development and production). The report will assess how these weaknesses impact the PLA's combat capabilities and its ability to achieve its missions. The report also will make recommendations for how an opponent could exploit these weaknesses.</p>
<p>This report's key research requirements are:</p>

<p>3) Detailed assessments of weaknesses in the PLA's organization and human capital, including (but not necessarily limited to) the PLA's obsolete national command structure, lack of combat experience, and insufficient education levels among its officer corps. Address each weakness in a separate section. Include the following elements and content for each weakness:</p>
<p>a. A description of the sources and the analytic methodology used for the assessment.</p>
<p>b. An explanation of remaining knowledge gaps and the quality and reliability of the sources used for the assessment.</p>
<p>c. A description of the critical assumptions on which the assessment is based and an explanation of the implications for the assessment if those assumptions are incorrect.</p>
<p>d. An assessment of which factors contribute to the weakness.</p>
<p>e. An assessment of the weakness' potential impact on the PLA's ability to achieve its missions through 2025.</p>
<p>f. If applicable, a detailed description of how the PLA is attempting to address the weakness and an assessment of how successful the PLA is or will be.</p>
<p>g. If applicable, recommendations for how an opponent could exploit the weakness.</p>
<p>Approximate emphasis: 20 percent</p>
<p>4) Detailed assessments of weaknesses in the PLA's combat capabilities in the land, air, maritime, space, and electromagnetic domains. Address each weakness in a separate section. Include the following elements and content for each weakness:</p>
<p>a. A brief description of sources and analytic methodology used for the assessment.</p>
<p>b. A brief explanation of knowledge gaps and the quality and reliability of the sources used for the assessment.</p>
<p>c. A brief description of the critical assumptions on which the assessment is based and an explanation of the implications for the assessment if those assumptions are incorrect.</p>

<p>The report also should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>
<p><br />Additional Requirements of the Commission:</p>
<p>1. Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>2. Once a contractor has been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>3. The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion.  In ordinary circumstances, once a contractor has been selected by the Commission and a contract signed, a draft of the report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date of issuance of the contract. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes that, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract.  The contractor, in their initial submission, should stipulate the time frame for submissions of the initial review draft.  It is to be understood, however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p>4. As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Coordinator shall act as a representative of the Commission in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in the Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Coordinator shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p>5. The report shall conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors or other deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor with notice that the draft does not conform to the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines, and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its technical editor for correction, the cost of which ($55 per hour for text, $65 per hour for endnotes) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p>6. At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.<br /> <br />7. Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant that they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and that the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p>8. The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p>9. After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the Contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's web site and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p>10. At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall agree to participate in up for four (4) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, D.C. area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the Contractor identified as "key personnel." This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the Contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Primary Selection Criteria:</p>
<p>1. The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time, and past performance with the Commission, if applicable.</p>
<p>2. The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("key research requirements").</p>
<p>3. The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>
<p>1. A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this RFP, to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project.</p>
<p>2. Identification of the principal researchers who will be responsible for the preparation of the report.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p><br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on a Contractor Proposal Form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p><br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p><br />(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each contract line item/CLIN as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:</p>
<p>An item/CLIN may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that item/CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each item/CLIN may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar items/CLINS.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.212-4 will be returned.</p>
<p>(a) Each invoice shall contain the following information:<br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor<br />(2) Contract or Delivery/Task Order Number/Modification No.<br />(3) Vessel name<br />(4) Name of the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer<br />(5) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price<br />(6) Percentage of completion for each CLIN identified <br />(7) Shipping and Payment Terms<br />(8) Invoice Routing Code (IRC) assigned by the Coast Guard <br />(9) Annotate on the invoice indicating that the contractor represents a small business for accelerated payment purposes.<br />(10) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_x] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [x_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_x] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [x_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[x_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.

Commercial vehicle access to YTC will be allowed only at the Main Gate (Exit 26 from I-82) on Monday through Friday.  This gate will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0700 hours and 1530 hours.  The gate is closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays).  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on YTC.    If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. <BR> <BR>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST YOU, AND WILL HELP TO EXPEDITE PAPERWORK AND PAYMENT.
     a. Only one delivery will be accepted against each line item.  Backorders will NOT be accepted on individual line items.     b. Deliver on or before date specified.  Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_X] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the <br />Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and <br />Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

The Government does not own a technical data package for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties.<br />Schedule is critical for the procurement and delivery of spares, and any potential source must be able to deliver these items within the required timeframe to meet critical mission requirements. The Government plans to award a contract in 3rd quarter FY14 consisting of a base CLIN with two (2) pre-priced option CLINs. The CLINs will be structured to incorporate some of the peculiar spare parts identified in attachment 1. <br />Potential offerors who are capable of meeting the Air Force's spare requirements and delivery schedule outlined above are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC). The offeror's SOC shall clearly demonstrate that: (1) it is capable of producing the spare components listed above within the delivery lead times specified; (2) the delivered spare components are produced in compliance with "International Standard ISO 9001, Quality Management Systems Requirements; and (3) spare components delivered will meet form, fit, and performance requirements for physical and functional compatibility with the BQM-167A aerial target system to include target and associated support equipment. The SOC shall be limited to 25 pages including attachments. Responses are requested by 21 January 2014.

The Government may use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make an appropriate acquisition decision for this project.    <br>   Response to this notice would not need to provide a product, but a solution, that would be an approved equal to the contemplated product described below.  The entirety of the scope described below is important.  Offerors providing only an aspect of the scope would need to team with a partner to provide a solution.     <br>   Responses should come in the form of a cut sheet or white paper with sufficient detail to provide an equally effective and cost conscious alternative to the product/solution described below.  30 days are provided to supply a response.   <br>   Point of Contact for this notice is Jeffrey S.

The project would involve drilling a near vertical 6 quote mark  diameter hole that straddles the monolith joint starting at the top deck of the dam and extending through the entire structure into the bedrock below and filling the drilled hole with  expanding grout to restore the waterstop.  The tolerance for deviation from vertical is 0.1 degree for the drilled hole.  At several times throughout the drilling process, the progress of the drilled hole will be checked to ensure the monolith joint is contained within the drilled area.  Where the drilled hole is near the top of dam, the hole will be monitored visually.  When a visual inspection of the drilled hole is no longer possible, the Contractor will be required to utilize a down-hole camera for inspection/monitoring purposes.  A permanent video record of the drilled hole will need to be provided to the Government as part of the project.  As part of the drilling activities, the driller will be expected to capture, remove, and dispose of all tailings, air, water, and dust created during drilling operations.   <br>   After completion of the drilled hole and verification that the monolith joint is contained within the hole for the entire length of the joint, the Contractor will insert an expanding grout into the hole to restore the waterstop.  Upon contact with water, the grout would begin to expand, eventually filling the entire void space of the hole.  Additionally, the product would need to be able to expand and contract yearly as the monoliths shrink and swell with temperature changes.  In order to insure that the entire drilled hole is filled, the product will need to be a solid product at the time it is placed into the hole.  This will provide a guarantee that the entire length of the drilled hole is completely filled with the waterstop product.  The product should be solid cylinders cut to a manageable length for installation.  The waterstop cylinders need to have the following physical and material properties:   <br>    	Specific gravity above 1.04.   <br>    	Expansion pressure between 250 and 450 psi at full depth.   <br>    	Unrestrained expansion diameter of 1.5 times the original cylinder.   <br>    	Service temperature range between 30 and 70 degrees F.   <br>    	Durometer hardness shore A scale A30.   <br>    	Less than 0.05 percent air entrainment.   <br>    	Confined compression strength over 900 psi.   <br>    	Cylinder diameter 5 inches with a 5% tolerance.   <br>   Additionally, the waterstop product manufacturer needs to have 5 years of experience performing waterstop remediation with 3 successful applications of the proposed approach at a depth that exceeds 100 feet below water.

<p>4. Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if they determine that the circumstances of contract action deem only one source reasonably available:</p>
<p>Check the appropriate reason below:</p>
<p>X Only one responsible source and no other<br />supplies or services will satisfy agency <br />requirements, i.e. Unique capabilities, Limited <br />number of sources, Proprietary data or <br />Brand Name Mandatory<br />X_Unusual &amp; Compelling Urgency<br />___Exclusive Licensing Agreements<br />___Industrial Mobilization/Standardization</p>
<p>5. Impact Statement (describe the impact on the mission or property)<br />Without these items the CGCBERTHOLF will not satisfy operational requirement based on IMO MSC 74(69) annex IV. BERTHOLF lack of secondary fathometer could relate in operational delays when departing dry dock period.</p>
<p>6. Explain why an adequate purchase description or other information suitable to solicit by Full and Open Competition has not been developed or are not suitable.<br />Both transducers are manufactured by L3 ELAC Nautik located in Germany. These specific transducers have to be custom built when ordered. The LSE-313 would normally be within FEDLOG, but lead time is approximately 39 weeks. Since the BERTHOLF experienced the failure on their secondary fathometer three years ago they are eager to have it replaced during dry-dock (Dec-Feb). The VE-5900 Echo Sounder system is now CASRPEP'd (CASUALTY/INITIAL-13100/VE-5900 DEPTH INDICATOR/EIC:/CAT:2//) The current stock level is insufficient to support our request. A market research was performed to identify all sources capable of selling these items. The only source found to be capable is L3 ELAC Nautik located in GERMANY. Additonal market research found Northrop Grumman as a resource to order this specific transducer through manufacture.</p>
<p>9. Provide a Statement of Actions, if any, the government may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before future acquisitions are required.<br />The government would need to acquire the rights to proprietary transducer and components in order to solicit additional competition to reverse engineer or repair to specifications this equipment and its associated components.</p>
