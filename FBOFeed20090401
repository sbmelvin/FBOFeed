The US Government gives no guarantee of future services and reserves the right to terminate this contract for either default or convenience.<BR><BR>The Contractor will establish and operate a kitchen at or near NSTA with the ability to feed up to 1000 personnel, 3 hot A meals daily with the capability to provide up to 2 prepared meals (breakfast and dinner meals) for remote feeding. The Contractor will as directed by the KO prepare a midnight meal. The Contractor will ensure water used for culinary and consumption purposes is potable to the US Army standards identified in the USAREUR Support Contract (USC). The US Government will provide to the Contractor the number of personnel for which meals are to be prepared for at NSTA. The Contractor will also use headcount records (DA FORM 3032) to use as historical data for number meals to prepare.  The Contractor will have to evaluate different options to use Government Furnished Equipment in support of this operation.  The final proposal will have taken into account the following options:  using a government furnished fest tent erected at NSTA, using alternative temporary facilities that can be capable of  Cold Basing which can be reassembled over the course of three years at the discretion of the contractor, which includes use of temporary, or mobile kitchen facilities; and erecting a non-government furnished fest tent. The Contractors plans must meet the standards set forth in the USC and as stated in the following publications: AR 30-22, DA Pam 30-22, AR 40-25, TM 10-412 Armed Forces Recipe Service, TB MED 577, TB MED 530, and all U.S. health and food safety standards in accordance with the above-mentioned publications.

Should any conflict occur in interpreting regulations or contractual requirements the final interpretation and guidance will come from either the KO.<BR><BR>Likely evaluation factors are as follows: <BR><BR>Technical, Past Performance, Ability to Use Local Labor, and Price. <BR>Technical and Past Performance are equal and more important than the Ability<BR>to Use Local Labor.  Non-priced factors are more important than Price.  As<BR>parity of non-priced factors emerges, Price becomes more important.<BR><BR>Local Labor is defined as from the country where service will be performed<BR>and will be measured as more is better.  <BR><BR>This will be a requirements contract with a base year plus 1 or 2 option<BR>years.  CLIN structure will likely have 4 CLINs per option year. 1 CLIN for the<BR>set-up and tear down, 1 CLIN for monthly service and maintenance, 1 CLIN for<BR>each projected meal provided in the DFAC, and 1 CLIN for each projected meal<BR>provided via mermites.

If adequate price competition is determined not to exist, the Government reserves the right to obtain certified cost or pricing data from the offeror. Based on the type of instrument proposed, use the appropriate cost proposal instructions, which can be found at the following AFRL website, www.kirtland.af.mil/prs to prepare the cost proposal. Submit the electronic copy of the cost proposal worksheets on a compact disk in a PC compatible file format in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 or later version. The file must contain all cell formulas. Cost proposals have no page limitations but offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 75 pages as a goal. <br />b. Business Section. The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual arrangement, such as type of contract/instrument, any unique terms and conditions, any exceptions to terms and conditions of this announcement, and any information not technically related. Provide rationale for exceptions. As a goal, offerors are requested to keep the business section to 20 pages. This section should include the following items as appropriate. Referenced documents are available at http://www.kirtland.af.mil/prs/. <br />(1) Completed representations and certifications and any specific representations and certifications identified in this BAA. <br />(2) Completed Proposal Content Checklist. Failure to provide a complete proposal may result in a determination that the proposal is non-responsive and may be eliminated from consideration for award. <br /><br />8. PROPOSAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES <br />A. GENERAL. <br />The Government reserves the right to select for award to responsible offerors/contractors any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time. You may be ineligible for award if all requirements of this announcement are not met by the proposal due date and time. At minimum, incomplete proposals may be given lower priority and, although technically acceptable, not awarded due to funding limitations. No further evaluation criteria will be used. <br />B. EVALUATION CRITERIA. <br />The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 35.016. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance: <br />Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; <br />Importance to AFRL/RD programs; <br />Fund availability/affordability <br />Price will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. Price will be evaluated and may be negotiated if necessary on proposals selected for award. <br /><br />C. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS <br />The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows: <br />1. CATEGORY I: Well conceived scientifically and technically sound proposals important to program goals and objectives. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance subject to funding constraints. <br />2. CATEGORY II: Scientifically or technically sound proposals that may require further development and may be recommended for acceptance, but are at a lower priority than Category I proposals and are not always funded. <br />3. CATEGORY III: Proposals not technically sound or do not meet agency needs and may be recommended for rejection. <br />D. AWARD NOTICES <br />Offerors will be notified in writing whether or not their proposal is recommended for award. An award recommendation is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract, is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award. <br />E. DEBRIEFINGS <br />When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content will vary to be consistent with the procedures set out in FAR 35.016 governing BAAs. <br />9. OTHER INFORMATION <br />A. SUBCONTRACTING PLANS: Small Business Subcontracting Plans are required under FAR 19.702 for efforts anticipated to exceed $550,000. Prospective offerors shall submit applicable subcontracting plans in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.704 along with the technical and cost proposals. Small business is exempt from this requirement. If a company has a master subcontracting plan, as described in FAR 19.701 or a comprehensive subcontracting plan, as described in DFARS 219.702, a copy of the plan shall be submitted with the proposal. The subcontracting plan is a part of the cost/business section of the proposal and will not be included in the page count. <br />B. WIDE AREA WORK FLOW NOTICE: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . <br />C. ASSOCIATE CONTRACTOR AGREEMENTS. Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the contracting officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required. <br />D. ITEM IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION. Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Apr 2005) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/index.html . <br />E. Offerors who have forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA's) and forward pricing rate recommendations (FPRR's) should submit them with their proposal. <br />F. Pursuant to Far 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Pre-award Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past two years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>

<DESC>The G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VA Medical Center intends to limit competition to electrical contractors in the local area with high voltage transformer experience due to unusual and compelling urgency. Justification: This is a requirement to replace an existing high voltage electrical transformer that services the Nursing Home. A large amount of oil was discovered running down the sidewalk adjacent to the transformer this week - indicating an imminent, catastrophic failure.  We are monitoring the oil level daily and refilling regularly.  This is not a sustainable situation.  The installation of a new transformer once the contract is awarded is anticipated to take 6-8 weeks. The Nursing Home is faced with an imminent catastrophic failure in the meantime based on the deteriorated condition of the existing transformer. Failure of the transformer will result in the Nursing Home quickly becoming uninhabitable, causing patient health related issues.The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 238210 with a size standard of $14M. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Inquiries may be directed to Lisa Maisel at lisa.maisel@va.gov, 601-368-4468. Inquiries must be submitted not later than April 8, 2009 by 2:00 CDT.

<DESC><p>On a sole source basis the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to execute contract modifications with DigitalGlobe, Inc. and ORBIMAGE, Inc. to extend each vendor's contract, with options, through June 30, 2010. Each vendor provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery and imagery derived products. High resolution geospatially accurate imagery and imagery derived products are key elements in support of multiple U.S. Government initiatives. The continued acquisition of DigitalGlobe and ORBIMAGE high resolution commercial satellite imagery supports these requirements. Each vendor&rsquo;s satellite constellation has the unique technical characteristic which justifies sole-source acquisitions that no other commercial remote sensing high resolution vendors can equal at this time. Only DigitalGlobe and ORBIMAGE can provide these products with the high-resolution imagery required by NGA. See Note 22.</p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a long history of translating scientific and technical developments into clinical practice.  The Translational Medicine Branch of NHLBI consists of scientists and physicians with expertise in pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases together with a world class group of physical scientists specializing in the application of real time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) approaches to clinical sciences.  Despite the fact that the NIHs reputation is well known, it does not have a robust clinical MRI diagnosis and treatment program in childrens cardiovascular/lung diseases.  As a result, the NHLBI is seeking to enter into a contract with a local institution with extensive experience in the clinical diagnosis, treatment and management of childrens cardiovascular and lung diseases.  The primary goal is to develop a program to conduct investigational studies on the use of MRI in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in children.  All patients referred through the NHLBI for MRI study purposes would be followed/managed clinically by the contractor.  The successful contractor will provide the day to day clinical management and care of all the patients.  This would have to be accomplished through a successful pre-existing infrastructure including 24/7 physicians and nurse coordinators availability in support of the MRI patient populations.  Patients referred to the contractor will be seen and evaluated at the contractors facilities.  They will be given the option of enrollment in one or more of the collaborative NHLBI/contractor clinical trials.  Although it is envisioned that most clinical activity will occur at the contractors facility, some patients may be referred to the NIH Clinical Center for specialized studies. The contractors existing MRI facility will be critical to the needs of this program.  The contractor must have a strong pediatric medicine program and be located in the local area as to allow patient treatment both at the NIH and the contractors facilities.  In addition, NHLBI staff will be working with the contractor at their site frequently, even daily, as part of this program.  

It is anticipated that one award will be made with a one year period of performance and four one-year option periods. This is not a request for proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  It is anticipated that an RFP detailing specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offerors proposal will be available on or about April 15, 2009.

<DESC><p>This notice is a correction to the previously submitted synopsis listed under Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posted December 1, 2008. This effort is not for commercial items. NIDA intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with The University of Miami for a project titled "The National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) on Drug Abuse." Vendors who submitted capability statements previously need not submit additional information. The University of Miami will continue to provide development and implementation of the existing NHSN. The purpose of this contract is to foster drug abuse research and research training among Hispanics and the application of science findings to practice and public health. We anticipate awarding a 5-year contract. Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in the FAR 6.320-1, Only One Responsible Source. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in providing the required services make competition unfeasible.

The contract may include hardware manufacturing and testing; sustaining engineering; Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) Capsules; SSGN compatible CCLS Retrofit Kits; Special Tooling and Special Test Equipment; procurement of Range Safety Systems and Flight Test Kits; Operational Test Launch (OTL) Flight Testing, Product Verification Testing and Functional Ground Testing; Guidance Test Set upgrades, support, maintenance and repair; refurbishment of containers and capsules; Government Furnished Equipment repair and upgrade; engineering and test support; various elements of logistics support; and Tomahawk Block IV training courses.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS).  RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile, and is the only source capable of meeting scheduled thresholds for Fleet load outs of the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

(VCT), 1900 Campus Commons Drive, Suite 300, Reston, VA 20191-5464, to redesign the existing unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) control software and to implement and validate the modifications to extend the range of missions the UUV can perform.  VCT has performed all of the mathematic modeling for approximately 50 or more Office of Naval Research (ONR) autonomous vehicles.  VCT is familiar with this specific UUV and has existing algorithms that can be easily modified to implement into the UUV in support of an ONR funded task.  To modify and validate the UUV control software is critical to the operation of the UUV system.  Use of another company to modify the algorithms may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the UUV system and render it unacceptable for operational use.  The upgr! aded control software will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018. NAICS CODE IS 541330.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends tomodify the following four multiple award contracts in order to increase theestimated level of effort by 105,564 labor hours: N66001-05-D-5039 withGeneral Dynamics Information Technology of Fairfax, VA; N66001-05-D-5040with L-3 Services Inc. of Marlton, NJ; N66001-05-D-5041 with ScienceApplications International Corporation of San Diego, CA; and N66001-05-D-5042 with Northrop Grumman Defense Mission Systems of Reston, VA.  Thecontracts were awarded in July 2005 and September 2005 against solicitationN66001-05-R-5001 with a 5 year period of performance for 420,000 laborhours.  The labor hour ceiling has been divided among the awardees throughthe fair opportunity process at FAR 16.505(b).
The combined effort under these contracts has exceeded expectations and isaveraging 105,564 labor hours per year.  With the contracts rapidlyapproaching ceiling, a comprehensive follow-on competitive acquisition isplanned with an anticipated award in FY 2010.  While the current multiple awardcontracts have sufficient time remaining, a ceiling increase is needed toprovidecontinuation of support until the follow-on competitive action is awarded.  TheGovernment intends to increase the ceiling by 105,564 labor hours which will bedivided among the awardees through the fair opportunity process at FAR 16.505(b).  It is expected that the ceiling increase will satisfy programrequirementsfor one year, which is the anticipated timeframe required to award the newcompetitive contracts.
If the ceiling of this contract is not increased, the Government will bewithoutessential services that provide system development and life-cycle maintenanceefforts in support of the warfighter.  Interruption of these services wouldresultin unacceptable delays in meeting critical development milestones andoperational capability deployment dates.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes;however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which willbe considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not tocompete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion ofthe Government.  Authority for other than full and open competition is 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no othersupplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. See Note 22. Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that an Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904.

At this time there are no funds allocated or set aside for the future of this requirement.

This sources sought is only an attempt to locate experienced businesses and collect pertinent information on those businesses that are experienced in aircraft maintenance, fuels, supply, munitions, and transient alert services. Any formal solicitation that may result from this synopsis will be announced separately. The Air Force is only interested at this point in identifying interested and capable contractors for these services, as such, parties interested in this synopsis should read all attached documents and follow the below instruction to potential offerors.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview of Requirements:</span> This is a world-class aircraft maintenance, transient alert, fuels, supply and munitions service requirement supported by the contractor, who shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, vehicles and materials (not included in Government Furnished Equipment) to support the missions of the 89th Airlift Wing (AW), 316th Wing (WG) and their customers. The scope of maintenance includes support of 2 VC-25A, 8 C-20, 4 C-32A, 4 C-37A, 1 C-37B, 2 C-40B aircraft, 19 UH-1N helicopters, 4 Silver Bullets, 2 Senior Leader In-transit Pallets (SLIP), associated seat pallets, support equipment, as well as limited on-equipment (specialist) and limited off-equipment (back shop) aircraft maintenance support for the Presidential Airlift Group (PAG). Included in this scope is aircraft maintenance, servicing and fueling for all US and foreign aircraft that are transient on Andrews Air Force Base (AAFB), MD. Additionally, we require supply chain management to include Report of Survey Administration services and fuels support for 89 AW, 316 WG, all transient aircraft, 459th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) aircraft (eight KC-135R) and various Naval Air Facility Washington aircraft. Lastly, we require fuel support to other federal agencies and base tenant units outlined in the Memorandums of Agreement (MOA), Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) or support agreements.</p>
<p>The objective of this requirements is to provide the 89 AW and 316 WG, located at AAFB and their customers with fixed wing and rotary aircraft maintenance, fuel, munitions, supply and transient alert services in support of the safe and timely transportation of their customers which include the President of the United States, the Vice President, Cabinet officials, members of congress, and senior civilian, military and foreign leaders. This is a 24-hour a day, 7-day a week (24/7), no fail, high expectation mission. The 89 AW and 316 WG, as well as their customers, count on these services to provide world-class airlift services. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C-20 Requirements:</span> At present, the future Air Force C-20 line maintenance work at Andrews AFB is part of the Tinker AFB C-20 CLS requirement/contract. However, the AF long term goal is to have one contractor perform all Air Force line maintenance at Andrews. Therefore, we have included Air Force C-20 line maintenance as a requirement in this draft PWS. This will provide the Air Force with maximum flexibility to ensure support for the AF C-20's at Andrews should it decide to change the point of control for this work.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Contract Information/FOIA Information:</span> These requirements are currently under contract and were awarded to one contractor, the Government intends to again award to one contractor. A potential contract term or type has yet to be determined; however, the current contract term is 10 years and the current contract type is Firm-Fixed Price with Award Terms and cost-reimbursable FFP CLINs. The current contract is expected to expire on 31 March 2011. <strong>Attachment 1 contains all the releasable FOIA information for the current contract for your convenience.</strong></p>
<p>The current and planned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 488190 (Other Support Activities for Air Transportation), with the applicable small business size standard of $6.5 million in annual gross receipts</p>

<p>For Industry Day, it is our intention to provide responses to any questions that we receive in advance and that are submitted using the VIPSAM Contractor Questionnaire. Questions raised the day of the event will receive a "non-official" answer and may not receive an answer at all if further research is needed; therefore contractors are highly encouraged to submit questions in advance.</p>

<p>6. Please review all FOIA releasable data on the current VIPSAM Contract. It should be noted that this document is vastly different in format from the current Performance Work Statement. This is due to both changes in Performance Based Acquisition requirements and the fact that Andrews AFB has undergone a significant reorganization since the award of the current contract which has redefined roles, responsibilities, and needs.</p>
<p>7. All information or updates in regards to this opportunity will be located on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) and can be found by typing FA7014-09-R-0032 in the &lsquo;Quick Search' box in the upper left-hand corner.

<DESC>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Ghent, New York that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 2,800 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space and 20 parking spaces.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2,640 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for a 5-year term.  The space must be available for occupancy September 1, 2009.  The delineated area is within an area bounded on the Bourdered on the North by Countyr RT 22, bordered on the south by State Highway 66, bordered on the east by County Route 21 and bordered on the west by State Highway 9H. This space must have easy access to primary roads. 

Other applicable requirements include:

	Sole tenancy (indicate if this is a requirement)
	Parking (number of on site, reserved spaces for official Government vehicles)
	Security (that is, lobby, loading dock access, parking, setbacks etc, where and as applicable)
	Others

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.  

Written expressions of interest must be submitted to the above address by 5:00 pm on April 20, 2009, and must include the following information:

	Building name and address and location of the available space within the building
	Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced
	ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.  Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any
	Date of space availability
	Method of rentable space measurement
	Building ownership information
	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost.  Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking
	List of building services provided

The Governments decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

<DESC>The files comprising the SIR are contained in the attached zip file. Go to URL http://www.faa.gov/help/zip_files for assistance in opening the zip file.
In addition, attached are questions received from industry and FAA responses regarding the Aviation Liability Insurance Brokerage Services Program. The FAA has National contracts for providing air traffic control services at visual flight rules (VFR) control towers. This program is referred to as the Federal Aviation Administration Contract Tower (FCT) program. Acknowledging the devastating effects associated with an aircraft accident, there is a need for the FAA to provide aircraft accident liability insurance coverage at each of the FCT locations. The FAA has established a $10,000,000.00 per occurrence amount for each of the approximately 240 FCT locations. This SIR will procure the brokerage services necessary to obtain the aviation liability insurance. 
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (May 1, 2009).  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  
In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the Business Declaration Form included in the SIR. 
Proposals must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. EST, Friday, May 1, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

The Contractor shall be required to provide investigators access to toxicological evaluations that are required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when requesting an Investigational New Drug (IND) designation for clinical studies.  This preclinical drug-development program expands the potential range of drug therapies and imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease and other aging-related diseases by making these resources available to a larger and more diverse group of investigators.  The Contractor shall be able to provide services in the following four general categories:  (1) analytical chemistry, (2) pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, (3) preliminary toxicity screens, and (4) IND-directed toxicology studies including safety pharmacology. The species to be used in the in vivo studies shall include rodents (rats or mice), dogs (purpose bred Beagle dogs), rabbits, non-human primates, and other animal models as appropriate.  The Contractor shall also be capable of performing the following types of studies: (1) Single-dose and 7-day dose range finding toxicity studies in rats and dogs; (2) Expanded acute intravenous toxicity studies in rats and dogs; (3) Functional observation battery evaluations of neurobehavioral effects in rats; (4) Safety pharmacology in rats and dogs; (5) 30-day toxicity studies in rats and dogs; (6) 90-day toxicity studies in rats and dogs; (7) Acute vascular irritation study in rabbits; (8) Cardiopulmonary evaluation by intravenous administration in dogs; (9) In vitro mutagenicity, genotoxicity, and microsomal studies; (10) Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability studies in rats and dogs; (11) Immunotoxicity studies in rats; (12) Single intravenous dose study in rabbits; and (13) Preparation of IND package for submission to the FDA.  Depending on the specific protocol, the Contractor shall be able to perform hematological and clinical chemistry parameters, urinalysis, ophthalmological examination, necropsy, microscopic examination of tissues, and pharmacokinetic analyses.  
 
 It is a mandatory qualification criterion that the Contractors laboratory must be in compliance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice Regulations (GLP) as published in the December 22, 1978 Federal Register (Volume 43, No. 247, pp. 59986 60025).  GLP Regulations are available on the World Wide Web (WWW) at www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/bimo/glp/87finalrule.htm and GLP Regulations Questions and Answers are available at www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/old004fn.pdf. Compliance is documented in a FDA inspection report. A copy of the two most recent FDA GLP inspection reports must be included in the proposal.  If only one (1) report exists, it is acceptable to include only that one (1) report. In addition, the other mandatory qualification criterion is that the Contractor's animal facilities must be accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International as indicated by providing the latest accreditation report. Information about AAALAC accreditation is available on the WWW at www.aaalac.org. The Contractor must also provide an animal welfare assurance indicating compliance with the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, information for which is available on the WWW at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm 

It is estimated that approximately 3.4 FTEs will be required annually for the performance of this project over a five (5)-year period of performance.  Small business concerns within this size standard that believe they possess the capability necessary to successfully undertake the work described in the Statement of Work should submit an original and three (3) copies of their capability statement tailored to this requirement to the address shown. Respondents may also submit their capability statements via e-mail or fax.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BIOMETRICS SYSTEMS INTEGRATION SERVICES - Within the next several months, the Department of State intends to release a Request for Quotation (RFQ) through the GSA Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Multiple Award Schedule. The purpose of the RFQ will be to acquire the services of a well-qualified organization to integrate automated face recognition (FR) systems, and possibly other biometric technologies (e.g., iris recognition), into the Departments visa and passport application processing operations.  For this effort, the Department intends to issue a five-year, performance-based, firm-fixed-price contract to a systems integrator, with award likely by October 2009.  This preliminary announcement is a Request for Information (RFI)  first, to alert those organizations that may be interested and need to establish prime-subcontractor relationships before the release of the RFQ and, second, to request white papers that will be used by the Department to identify organizations on Schedule 70 from which proposals would be solicited.

In addition to tailoring its biometric recognition systems to meet the Departments visa and passport processing needs, the organization selected for the proposed effort will be required to install, operate, and maintain their systems, as well as to update their systems periodically to the evolving state-of-the-art.  Biometric technology is required by the Department to comply with mandates in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  For about five years, the Department has been using digitized face images and FR technology to confirm a visa or passport holders identity more reliably, facilitate the detection of fraudulent applications, increase the security of U.S. visas and passports, detect or deter known terrorists or criminals, and verify travelers identities at U.S. ports of entry.  The biometric capability to be provided by the selected integrator will support the processing of applications for U.S. nonimmigrant and immigrant visas (NIV/IV), passports, and E-Diversity Visas (E-DV).  

The requirements anticipated for the FR processing of NIV/IV and passport applications include open-set one-to-many matching (identification) of applicant-provided face-photo images with face images in legacy databases holding many tens of millions of images and in various watch-lists containing hundreds of thousands of images.  In some cases, binning (i.e., filtering based on criteria developed by the Department) will be used to increase accuracy and reduce the processing required to search very large databases.  Passport and NIV/IV matching will be performed on integrator-provided equipment.  It is anticipated that the FR systems selected will be dedicated to enrolling the legacy databases and watch-lists during the first 100 days of the contract.  It is also anticipated that during each of the five years of the contract, approximately 15 million new passport images and approximately 10 million new NIV/IV images will need to be enrolled and searched by the systems, corresponding to a total enrollment and matching rate of up to about 4,000 images per hour (allowing for additional capacity during peak travel periods and expedited responses).  The capability for the systems to perform one-to-one matching (verification) is also required.  The passport and NIV/IV FR systems will have the capability to read biometric transactions from an Oracle database, process the transactions, and write transaction outputs as records to the Oracle database.  The recognition score for each potentially matching image returned from each search will be one of the outputs, and the maximum rank (number of potential matches returned) for each search will be an adjustable parameter.  At least two identical FR systems are required in different Department-provided secure facilities to share the load and to serve as backups to one another in the event of a system failure.

The requirements anticipated for the E-DV FR system include open-set identification of hundreds of thousands of applicant-submitted face images with images in a database of approximately 15 million images.  Operating on Government-furnished equipment (GFE) within a Department-provided secure facility, the E-DV FR system will enroll all submitted E-DV images during a two-month period every year.  Once enrollment is completed, matching will be performed within a following two-month period, using the same GFE. 

In addition to the FR matching capabilities, the following services, products, or capabilities are likely to be needed by the Department:

	Maintenance of a system log file, which can be accessed by Department of State personnel at any time, including volumes enrolled and a list of all images that failed to enroll, along with the reasons for the failures-to-enroll, number of images matched, periods of system downtime, and gallery sizes  
	Operations manuals and system diagrams for all biometric systems installed under the contract
	Periodic performance (speed and accuracy) testing of all biometric systems installed under the contract
	Installation, following Department approval, of updated versions of the selected FR software within one month of their public release
	Face image quality assessment software to test the suitability of applicants images for FR and their conformance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) quality requirements for face images in passports.  This software will provide quality metric values that convey to an operator whether a submitted image is likely to be enrolled successfully and, if not, a probable reason why it would not be enrolled.  Related software that provides the capability to perform quality assessment of passport or visa application photo images submitted over the Internet will also be required.
	A software tool to facilitate visual comparisons of face images by trained face examiners
	A software utility for manual enrollment of face images (based on manually entered eye positions), when the automated system cannot find the eyes
	Acquisition, enrollment, and matching capabilities for other biometric technologies, such as iris recognition

To manage the number of organizations that prepare completed technical and cost proposals, the Department will use a three-phase, down-select acquisition process.  In the first phase, responses to this RFI will be evaluated to determine which organizations are solicited to respond to the RFQ.  If your organization would like to participate in the first phase, you must respond to this announcement by e-mailing to Ms. Jo-Ann Stewart (at StewartJ@state.gov) a white paper describing your organizations capabilities and experience in biometrics systems integration.  Your submission in response to this RFI must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. EDT on Friday, 24 April 2009.  Your white paper must be prepared in Microsoft Word 2003, be no greater than five pages in length, and include the following information:  1.) your organizations full name, headquarters location, and location of an office in the Washington, DC area, if any, 2.) the name of a point-of-contact and his/her e-mail and conventional mailing addresses, 3.) a description of the qualifications of the key staff who will be involved, 4.) a description of your organizations experience with FR and other biometric technologies, with particular emphasis on government applications and one-to-many matching, and 5.) a brief description of your planned approach to providing biometrics systems integration services to the Department.  Your response must also include the table shown below, with all applicable fields completed.  The table will not count as one of the allowed five pages for the white paper; however, the table should contain no more than five projects involving face recognition or other biometrics for which your organization has been a major technical contributor or prime contractor.  

All questions concerning this RFI may be submitted by sending an e-mail to Ms. Stewart no later than 4:00 p.m. EDT Friday, 10 April 2009.  Questions received after that date will not be answered, unless the Government determines the answer to the question imparts information material to Industrys ability to respond to this RFI.  Government responses to questions will be posted.  The required format for the submission of questions is provided at the end of this RFI.

Based upon the responses to this RFI, organizations deemed qualified by the Department will be selected to participate in the second phase of the acquisition.  Those organizations selected will receive a copy of the RFQ and be solicited to submit full technical and cost proposals.  After an evaluation of all submitted technical proposals, up to three organizations will be selected to participate in the third phase of the procurement, during which they will be asked to submit and run evaluation versions of their offered FR systems for recognition accuracy testing.  The accuracy testing will use face images representative of those now being processed in applications received for U.S. visas and/or passports.  The Department will consider the results from that testing, along with the content of the technical and cost proposals, in its award of a contract for the proposed biometrics systems integration effort.  

The issuance of this RFI and its solicitation of white papers do not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of any information requested.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Proprietary/competition sensitive information will be protected from disclosure to the greatest extent practical, however, it is preferred that respondents do not provide proprietary or otherwise restricted responses.  Each page considered by a submitting organization to contain proprietary information must be so marked.

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Labor is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement entitled "Scanning, Electronic Filing and Retrieval System" for the Wage and Hour Division (WHD), Employment Standards Administration (ESA). This procurement will involve development of a comprehensive electronic scanning, filing and retrieval system for historic and new WHD documents for use by WHD's national and field office staff.</p>
<p>The system to be developed should be available for use at all times by WHD staff at the national office in Washington, D.C., and at field offices throughout the country. WHD is seeking a system that will incorporate a pre-determined list of tag words, or metadata, and files which would be used for historic documents as well as current and future documents.</p>
<p>WHD seeks to implement a program to convert seventy years of historical records, including regulatory histories, opinion justifications, initiatives, and other key documents, into easily retrievable and accessible digital records. Currently, WHD has 2,000 linear feet of paper records. WHD still uses these records as a basis for current legal interpretations, policy determinations, and legislative and program analyses. Many of the documents, dating back to the 1930s, are extremely fragile and irreplaceable. In addition, WHD has thousands of historic documents currently stored in bookcases, file cabinets, cardboard boxes, and card catalogues that can never be replaced if damaged or lost. WHD must also develop a logical, cross-agency system for filing, retrieving, and searching electronic document files to enable WHD staff throughout the country to quickly save, file, and retrieve documents. In addition, WHD's electronic library would be tagged with a records retention schedule established by the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
<p>WHD would also convert current paper-based work processes. This program would enhance current physical space, reduce the need for storage areas, preserve important records, and increase accessibility of compliance documents to field staff and the public. Additionally, this initiative enables WHD to comply with the National Archives and Records Administration and OMB Circular No. A-130 electronic records regulations, with Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework and with DoD Directive 5015.2.</p>
<p>Interested contractors responding to this Request for Information (RFI No. DOL099RI20672 will be required to indicate their ability to fulfill the requirements that are stipulated below:</p>
<p>1. Scan approximately 2,000 linear feet of historic documents, many in very fragile condition, on site at the WHD national office in Washington, D.C.<br />2. Build an electronic filing/retrieval system which automatically recognizes WHD-provided lists of tag words and automatically sends scanned records to one or more files pre-determined by WHD. <br />3. Build an electronic tag system which indicates National Archives and Records Administration schedules and sends records at tag dates to NARA automatically or by prompt. <br />4. Ensure the same electronic file/retrieval system can be used at computers or laptops by WHD investigators and other staff members throughout the country when new documents are saved. <br />5. Ensure the electronic system is accessible on a shared drive and is accessible to all WHD staff throughout the country. <br />6. Divide access between public and WHD-restricted.<br />7. Integrate with other WHD IT systems as necessary.<br />8. Build in document protection to protect authenticity. <br />9. Build in a FOIA-releasable database.<br />10.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request. This Request For Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION:  The United States Armys Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Advanced Weapon Sight Technology, Advanced Technology Objective for Demonstration (AWST ATO-D) program is intended to design, develop, and integrate the next generation of prototype Family of Weapon Sights (FWS) for Demonstration and User Evaluation during the FY 10  12 time period.  The FWS are intended to define role specific system capabilities for the infantry Soldier at the rifle and weapons squad level.  The FWS for the infantry rifle squad could include an ultra light weight for the basic rifleman; a light to medium weight for the squad designated marksman and automatic rifle; a dual capable sight for the grenadier; and for the infantry weapons squad a ultra light weight for the basic riflemen; medium weight for the M240B gunner; a dual capable sight for the grenadier.  The increased Soldier capabilities include improved resolution and range performance with the first demonstration of Weapon Mounted Sights used in an offensive role by implementing Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA).  RTA will present a virtual reticle on the Soldier Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) using wireless data transmission between the Weapon Sight and Headborne vision system, such as Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG); RTA is intended to import boresighted Weapon Sight imagery into the HMD component.  The goal of the AWST program is to enhance Soldier capabilities regarding Situational Awareness, threat detection, range performance for target engagement, and reduced timelines between target detection and engagement.<BR><BR>The AWST ATO-D is developing, integrating, and demonstrating technologies and capabilities for the dismounted and mounted Soldier.  The products will include:<BR>  <BR>"	Baseline designs leading to a FWS based upon advancements in sensor technologies.  In addition, develop Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 prototypes representing a subset of these Weapon Sight family designs based upon consensus from PM-SSL and user juries.<BR>"	Basic FWS with improved range performance and Field Of View (FOV) based on the latest generation of high pixel count Focal Plane Arrays and High Resolution Color Displays.<BR>"	Increased capability FWS for infantry squad members and platoon leadership positions or crew served weapon operators with Advanced Digital Signal Processing, and RTA for presentation on a Soldier HMD.<BR>"	 Wireless Intra Soldier data/image transmission between AWST Weapon Sight and Soldier HMD.<BR>"	This ATO has been designated as a Reliability Insertion ATO; as such this effort will concentrate on technology reliability throughout its developmental efforts.<BR>The payoff is enhanced survivability of Soldiers with increased Weapon Sight capabilities and improved Situational Awareness (SA).<BR><BR>There are several potential transition scenarios for the various product lines resulting from the AWST program.  All of the program products have application to the Product Manager, Soldier Sensors and Lasers (PM-SSL) mission.  <BR><BR>REQUIREMENTS:  The NVESD is looking for individual Soldier weapon mounted weapon sights that meet the needs of the infantry squad/platoon individual Soldier positions/duties.<BR><BR>"	Range for probability of detection of a standing man at 1100 m 0.9 Pd.<BR>"	Nominal field of view for individual/crew 25/12 degrees.<BR>"	Rapid Target Acquisition approach (Wireless)<BR>"	Weight individual/crew d 3.2/4.4 lbs<BR>"	Power d 3 watts<BR>"	Built in battery meter capable of assessing the remaining power of standard commercial of the shelf (COTS) batteries such as AA or 123 batteries and based on system power consumption display to the user the estimated remaining life expectancy of the system batteries.<BR>"	Wirelessly transmit a virtual reticle from the FWS to the Soldiers HMD; this virtual reticle must maintain the Weapon Sight zero to allow engagement of threat targets without the need to cheek the weapon.<BR>"	Wirelessly transmit the FWS imagery to the Soldiers HMD<BR><BR>DELIVERABLES:  NVESD welcomes white papers recommending systems that will meet the suggested requirements in the specified time frame.  White papers should describe the contractors experience in design, development, fabrication and testing of similar systems, specifications of their systems, organizational capabilities and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for unit cost for potential future Government procurements.  Responders should also include performance predictions for their proposed FWS variations. The white paper should also address any other features of your system that may enhance its utility and reliability (of current and proposed new technologies) to the Army.  White papers should not exceed 15 pages in length.  The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements.  It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government.  However, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.  If so, clearly mark all proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum.  All responses to this market research shall be submitted within 45 calendar days of the date of this announcement.  All questions and white papers must be submitted via e-mail to Karen Travis, Contract Specialist at karen.travis1@us.army.mil.  Please reference solicitation number W909MY-09-Q-0003 in all requests for information and in the white paper submission.  No telephonic inquiries or requests will be honored.<BR>

<DESC><p>Sources Sought - 2010 Census Group Quarters and Demographic Items Research and Analysis</p>
<p>The Special Population Statistics area of the U.S. Census Bureau is planning to award, through other than full and open competition, a contract for Consulting, Research and Analysis with multiple functions and duties. This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>The purpose of the SS notice is to locate potential business concerns with the ability to perform the requirements of the program.</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this notice. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the Census Bureau may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>1. Background and Purpose</p>
<p>The Group Quarters Population - The group quarters data are collected for two categories of facilities: institutional, including residences such as correctional facilities, nursing homes and psychiatric hospitals; and non-institutional, which include residences such as college dormitories, military barracks and adult group homes.</p>
<p>The Special Population Statistics area of the Population Division is posting this Sources Sought notice to seek experienced and technically capable-and-competent sources that can provide the Special Population Statistics staff with expert advice and assistance in multiple tasks relating to:</p>
<p>&middot;	Developing enhanced procedures for editing and imputing decennial census data for all detailed types of institutional and non-institutional group quarters facilities, the demographic characteristics for the populations residing within all detailed types of institutional and non-institutional group quarters facilities, and the demographic characteristics for the population residing in households at high and low levels of geography;</p>
<p>&middot;	Developing automated analytical techniques and tools for evaluating and clearing 2010 Census data on all detailed types of institutional and non-institutional group quarters facilities, demographic characteristics for the populations residing within all detailed types of institutional and non-institutional group quarters facilities, and the demographic characteristics for the population residing in households at high and low levels of geography;</p>
<p>&middot;	Determining the quality of the 2010 Census data on all detailed types of institutional and non-institutional group quarters facilities, demographic characteristics for the populations residing within all detailed types of institutional and non-institutional group quarters facilities, and the demographic characteristics for the population residing in households at high and low levels of geography during the actual 2010 Census data evaluation and clearance period; and</p>
<p>&middot;	Advising junior staff on technical issues related to the decennial census group quarters, household, and demographic characteristics editing and imputation process and procedures at high and low levels of geography.</p>
<p>The Special Population Statistics staff of the Population Division is fully engaged in planning for the 2010 Census.  Many changes in editing and coding procedures have been made for the 2010 Census.  Therefore, the staff needs additional personnel resources to assist in conducting the development/assessment/impact/quality assurance activities listed above.</p>
<p>Because this need for assistance will have a limited duration, it will serve the Government's interests to procure the required services through a contract.  However, the complex and highly specialized nature of the work requires an unusual combination of decennial census edit and imputation data processing methods, and a high degree of demonstrated expertise and experience with decennial census institutional and non-institutional group quarters, household, and demographic item edit and imputation procedures.</p>
<p><br />2. Task Requirements</p>
<p>To achieve the purpose of this task, the Business Concern shall be technically capable of performing the following:</p>
<p>&middot;	Use the Statement of Work (SOW) to submit their proposal for the project.</p>
<p>The SOW will also provide the basis for the selected Contractor's Project Management Plan (PMP).  The Contractor's PMP is documentation of all tasks and subtasks to be performed during the performance of this task order and a master schedule for performing each activity and sub activity.  In this regard, the Census Bureau views the PMP as the roadmap of the planning, implementation and documentation.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NESDIS Acquisition Division SAP Team on behalf of NOAA intends to award on a sole source basis to the National Academy of Sciences, an order for services related to activities organized by the US National Committee for DIVERSITAS to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin. The Darwin Symposium will take place at the AAAS Auditorium in Washington, D.C. on April 15-16, 2009, and is entitled "Twenty-first Century Ecosystems: Systemic Risk and the Public Good - A National Academies Symposium on the Science and Policy for Managing the Living World Two Centuries after Darwin." The Symposium will feature leading scientists and policy makers from Washington and around the world, addressing the biodiversity aspects of key policy issues. The goal of the Symposium is to encourage the inclusion of ecosystems in the burgeoning new systems approach to complex policy issues such as energy, climate, trade, and agriculture - areas in which ecosystems services are often not a first order consideration. The Government believes this vendor is the only source. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541690 and size standard is $7.0. The Government intends to negotiate on a single source basis with the National Academy of Science, in accordance with FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 13, current through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-30. Notwithstanding the Government's intent to negotiate this requirement on a single source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a statement of technical capabilities which shall be considered by the agency. Information submitted in response to this notice must be in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Responses from this notice may be submitted via email to Gina E. Lee at gina.e.lee@noaa.gov, no later than 12:00 noon April 7, 2009, Eastern Standard Time. Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.

<a href="mailto:matthew.hauck@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>This notice constitutes a Request for Information/Comment only, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made for this effort at this time.<BR><BR>The United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) and the Marines Corps Systems Command Program Manager- Infantry Combat Equipment (ICE) are requesting information regarding methodologies for a robust and ergonomically efficient Quick Release System (QRS) for load bearing tactical vest platforms in emergency situations without depending on a cable intermediary.<BR><BR>Objective: <BR>To identify opportunities for research, development, commercialization and manufacturing of a durable, ambidextrous hand activated, four point QRS to enhance emergency doff performance of load bearing tactical vest and, increase Warfighter survivability in emergency situations, and withstand riggers of battlefield environment.<BR><BR>General Information:<BR>A QRS is needed to ensure ability to doff the tactical vest in rare emergency situations analogous to water submersion and/or ensnarement in close courter environments. The QRS is only engaged in an emergency situation by the Warfighter or a rescue aide.  The Warfighter should be able to adjust fit, don/doff the system into which it is integrated without activating the QRS and thus separating the components of the vest. Ultimately the QRS should not detract the Warfighter from mission objectives i.e. ability to carry a magnitude of 350 lbs of tension and withstand physical punishment and environmental extremes. <BR><BR>The QRS shall be reusable. The Warfighter shall re-coupe system after emergency or practice activation without repairing, replacing, or fine tuning parts of the QRS. The process for coupling and deployment of the QRS should be intuitive to a point where the Warfighter is not required to undertake specialized training. Furthermore the QRS shall be self contained and not require Warfighter to utilize specialized tools for coupling, constant maintenance or emergency deployment.  The time to assemble the QRS is between 10 seconds (objective) and 30 seconds (threshold) regardless of contents of Tactical vest and/or environmental conditions.  Design of the system should factor the Warfighter wearing cold weather or chemical protective gloves specifically during assembly and deployment. The coupling points should be the same points used during normal donning and doffing procedures. To prevent an unintended activation, the QRS should account for a deliberately activated safety mechanism and/or design the trigger within a protected location. The location of the trigger is determined by ability for the hand and activating gesture to be ambidextrous. If QRS includes a pull gesture, it should take between 5 and 10 lbs of force in any direction and not require the Warfighter to fully extend arm. A methodology is needed in event that the QRS is damaged. <BR><BR>Desired QRS should not reduce the performance of the Tactical Vest. The weight and thickness of the QRS should not cause pressure points or limit motion creating user discomfort. The total weight of the system should be .5 lbs (objective) and not exceed 1 pound (Threshold). Color of the QRS shall comply with outer carrier visual and near infrared requirements. Any exposed surface shall have a gloss no greater than 40 GU (gloss units ASTM D 523) <BR><BR>Durability and safety to the Warfighter are important factors in design of the QRS. The QRS should not be constructed with materials that, if damaged, would cause injury to Warfighter. Materials of the QRS should not combust, explode, or produce a flaming melt drip nor give off a toxicological or electromagnetic radiation. System or components should not be magnetic. Components shall not contain sharp edges or foreign materials that during normal operation or if damaged would cause injury to user.   The QRS should be robust in order to be activated after exposure to operational environment such as blunt impact, blast over pressure (up to 50 PSI), flame and thermal flux (will not melt drip from exposure), saltwater (non-corrosive after 2 hours of submersion), gasoline (not degrade after 2 hours of submersion), oil (in working order after 2 hours of submersion), high/low altitude, water submersion, fungus, and extreme climatic environments (temperature and humidity). In a battlefield situation medical personal need ability to quickly access a wounded Warfighter without completely removing the tactical vest and allow for quick reassembly for transportation. <BR>For developmental methods, estimated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for both the developmental material and the fabrication method or the material technology should also be included. All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this RFI by submitting technology description, product literature, product potential, technical specifications, pertinent test data (including pictures and videos), cost, material safety data sheets (if applicable), product availability,  product uses (past, present or future) and comments on performance. Responders are encouraged to provide an initial response NLT 30th April 2009. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the US Government. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received. Inclusion in this RFI or the resulting database does not constitute Government approval for any product. <BR><BR>Technical POC for this matter is:<BR><BR> Mr. Francisco J. Martinez <BR>Francisco.martinez8@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Please mail all submitted items to:       <BR>Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center<BR>16 Kansas Street<BR>Natick, MA 01760<BR>Attn.

<DESC>Brand Name of Equal JustificationIn accordance with FAR 6.302-1 the following brand name justification is provided.  It is requested that sufficient documentation be provided to allow evaluation of the proposed solution to meet the Governments requirements.  Please include a list-price model based on the information provided herein, inclusive of the cost of maintenance and support.  A list of resellers and any Government contracts (NASA, GSA, DOD, ect.) is also requested.  Responses to this posting will be evaluated to determine if full and open competition shall be provided.  The resulting solicitation will be posted for competition on the NASA SEWP IV contract.1.  Contracting Activity     Department of Veterans Affairs     Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management     Center for Acquisition Innovation - Austin     1615 Woodward Austin, TX 787722.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This justification and approval sets forth the facts and requests approval for the issuance of a Purchase Order (PO) for software (to include FileNet, SYSBACK, Active PDF, etc) with EPOCH Concepts, a veteran owned small business to procure various software components essential in the maintenance of the Virtual VA electronic document management system.  3.	Description of Service and Supplies:  The web-based, Virtual VA Electronic Documents Management system has been VBA Compensation & Pension Services paperless processing tool, supporting various pilot programs since FY2000.  In FY2008, the Paperless Processing of Veterans Claims initiative led by VBAs Office of Business Process Integration (OBPI) greatly accelerated various paperless processing pilot programs within C&P.  This was in response to the VA Deputy Secretarys mandate for all of VBA to be operating in a paperless environment by 2012.Virtual VA has grown from just under 400 users in FY2000, to over 13,000 users today and is instrumental in supporting various paperless initiatives.  While the VA has hired a Lead Systems Integrator to design an enterprise electronic document management system, it is likely 2 years a more before a product will allow for the sunset of the current application.  Virtual VA will continue to act as the bridge application to a paperless environment for C&P Service and has become a mission critical application in servicing many C&P claims.  As such, various software upgrades are required to support the current and anticipated growth into the system.  Additionally, Virtual VA has a document capture and scanning solution that will be expanded in key areas defined by VBA.  The capture solution is composed of hardware and software where each instance requires the appropriate licensing.  The software identified in this procurement supports this accordingly.The specific software seeking immediate procurement approval is:Active PDF Portfolio v3.8 Professional (Active PDF Portfolio comes with 2 threads)Active PDF Server 3-thread upgradesIBM TIVOLI STORAGE MANAGER FOR SYSTEM BACKUP AND RECOVERY 10 PROCESSOR VALUE UNITS (PVUS) LICENSE + SW SUBSCRIPTION & SUPPORT 12 MONTHSIBM FILENET CAPTURE PROF-MED VOL DEVICE LIC + SW MAINT 12 MONTHSIBM FILENET CAPTURE DESKTOP - ADDL DOC ENTRY DEVICE LIC + SW MAINT 12 MONTHSIBM FILENET CAPTURE-DOC PROCESSING LICENSE + SW MAINT 12 MONOTHS4.  Statutory Authority:  FAR 11.105(1) the particular brand name, product or feature is essential to the Governments requirements, and market research indicates other companies similar products do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agencys requirement because, substantial duplication of cost to the Government would occur that cannot be recovered through competition.  5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Active PDFThe Active PDF software suite is the only software that meets all of the requirements of document conversion to a non-editable format.  With the volume of documents inserted through BFI anticipated rise up to 250,000 documents per week and up to 7,500,000 pages per week, no other software can meet these volume and conversion requirements.Additionally, the Active PDF software is already integrated into the Virtual VA suite of applications.  If an alternative product where available, it would be costly to integrate a new product into an established solution, and would result in further delays to the paperless program.Active PDF Portfolio v3.8 and Active PDF Server software are essential products in supporting two critical functions of Virtual VA.  Batch File Import (BFI), is the engine which receives feeds from legacy systems, contract imaging initiatives, and other VA output engines, reducing manual printing and dependency on paper documents.  It also allows for user desktop inserts of electronic documents.  Both are converted into non-editable PDF documents accessible within the Virtual VA system.IBM Tivoli Storage Manager is essential in the completion of back-ups of the Virtual VA IBM DR550 and is the only product certified to provide a comprehensive back-up and restore solution.  As IBM is the manufacturer of the hardware, the software package is tightly integrated as part of the overall solution.  Tivoli Storage Manager has already been procured to support the Virtual VA program.  This procurement is for additional licenses to be fully compliant with all hardware components.  IBM FileNET Capture Professional, Capture Desktop, and Doc Processing are already integrated into the Virtual VA solution.  These licenses are required to support the expansion of Virtual VA capture and the forward movement of paperless processing.  VBA uses FileNet as their proprietary software for electronic document management and currently has an enterprise license for other FileNet components.  As this system is already in production operations for Virtual VA, any replacement product would require extensive customization to meet current VA requirements.  If the VA business lines were required to rehost these critical applications into another imaging products, the impact to the processing of veterans entitlement claims would be substantial.  The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 manadates that the government us COTS software which requires the last amount of costumization to meet the necessary business requirements.  The products listed above, are already part of the Virtual VA solution and thus represent the least amount of coustomization required to meet the needs of the organization.6.  Description of Market Research:  Internet searches, research on GSA schedules, and discussions held with commercial companies were held.  Research indicated that no other products in the market place can be identified to meet the Governments requirements identified above.  7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable.  Award will be issued as firm fixed priced off of the previously negotiated NASA SEWP IV contract.  Price competition is expected from authorized resellers.8.  Other Supporting Data:  N/A9.  Other Interested Sources:  None10.	Future barriers to competition:  VA has to solicit for only the specific brand names/models already in place in the OneVA network infrastructure at this time.  Future requirements developed as a result of the Paperless Initiative intend to remove barriers to competition by ensuring VA has data rights in order to maintain software internally or receive maintenance externally with knowledge of functional requirements.

<p><br />The base's exterior electrical system serves the North Base area of the base via one 5kV overhead circuit. This circuit is fed from Dominion Virginia Power's 5MVA transformer located just north of Facility 1358 through a 3.75MVA step down transformer. The 5kV overhead system is an old system in need of major repairs. The Base General Plan identifies multiple future facilities there that expand the base's mission with anticipated growth of 4.4 MVA. Base civil engineering proposes to add another service point on DVP's 34.5kV express feeder near the intersection of LTA Bypass and Weyland Road. The new circuit will serve the anticipated growth in this area.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p><br />AFFARS 5352.242-9000 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (JUN 2002) (LOCAL)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes for all contractor/subcontractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Every person (contractor/subcontractor) must obtain a pass, long term or short term, (AF Form 75) to gain entry to base. Short- term passes (24 hours or less) may be obtained at the Main Gate Visitors Center. All passes for longer than 24 hours are issued at Pass and Registration, Building 100, Suite 1001. Duty hours are Monday- Friday 0730 - 1600 hours . Large vehicles (pickup trucks or larger) that carry tools, toolboxes, equipment, supplies, etc. shall use the Commercial Gate (South Gate) for base access. Passenger type vehicles including minivans and pickup trucks that do not carry tools, toolboxes, supplies, and equipment, etc. shall use the Main Gate for base access. All contractor/subcontractor employees shall exit via the Main Gate. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation. Contractors/subcontractors will not have access to base facilities other than work location, except for on-base eating facilities. Contract work hours will be as stated in the Statement of Work. Contractors/subcontractors will not have access to the base on nights and weekends unless the contract requires work to be done at those times. Any vehicle entering the base is subject to inspection at any time. Refusal may result in the individual being temporarily or permanently barred from the base.</p>
<p>(b) All contractors/subcontractors are subject to criminal background checks prior to being allowed on base to work. Contractors/subcontractors will not be issued passes prior to submitting to background checks and being cleared by Security Forces Squadron (approximately a two week period). Contractors/subcontractors may be barred from base at the Installation Commander's discretion based on unfavorable information resulting from background checks. The contractor shall submit a written request to the contracting officer electronically in Excel format using the sample listed in Section J. A statement that all personal information will be handled in the manner required by the Privacy Act of 1974 shall be included on the form.

When reporting to the pass and registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) shall provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, and valid vehicle insurance certificate to obtain a vehicle pass. Contractors/subcontractors will not be allowed to escort any contractor/subcontractor employees onto the base. Personnel that are not United States citizens or are foreign nationals may be required to provide additional identification documents with the request for base access. Special authorization may be necessary, prolonging approval/disapproval. The Government reserves the right to deny access to anyone. Failure to allow a contractor/subcontractor employee on base does not constitute justification for a time extension or request for equitable adjustment.</p>
<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned contractor/subcontractor personnel. If contractor/subcontractor employees are added after initiation of work, the base entry list, in its entirety, indicating additions/deletions, shall be resubmitted not later than seven (7) days prior to the individual(s) starting work on McChord AFB.</p>
<p>(d) The contractor shall also be responsible for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site. Contractors must return passes if an individual is no longer part of the contract (finished with portion of work, terminated from service, barred from base). Contractors must report lost passes. Contractors must report missing employees with passes.

<p>Notice to Proposers</p>
<p>a. The Government intends to award a single (one (1)) contract as a result of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the proposer submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government. This will be a two phase evaluation. Phase One will result in the development of a short list of approximately five (5) firms who will proceed to Phase Two. Phase One evaluation will be made solely on the written responses provided to the Government. Phase Two evaluations will be based on technical and price proposal submissions and result in selection of a single firm. Phase Two award will be based on technical scores and pricing with technical and pricing weighing approximately equally. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror&rsquo;s initial proposal should contain the offeror&rsquo;s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.</p>
<p>b. An offeror&rsquo;s proposed Phase Two team, including the firms and key personnel proposed in response to Phase One Solicitation, and as supplemented for purposes of the Phase Two Solicitation, must continue to remain fixed for the duration of the Contract except as noted herein. An offeror may add consultants, subcontractors and/or key personnel to supplement design and/or construction resources as necessary to address proposal deficiencies. If extraordinary circumstances require a proposed change either during the solicitation or after contract award, the request with rationale must be submitted in writing to the CO, whom, at his or her sole discretion, provides written authorization of the change. Requests for a substitution must either be submitted prior to the submission of the Final Proposal Revision or must be clearly indicated in the Offeror&rsquo;s Proposal Cover Letter. The offeror shall provide the complete qualifications and experience of the firm or individual proposed to be substituted. Changing personnel may affect an Offeror&rsquo;s overall rating. Unauthorized changes can result in the elimination of the Offeror from the Phase Two competition.</p>
<p>c. Proposal Preparation, Phase One and Phase Two. Provide technical proposals complying with all instructions provided herein. The technical proposal shall be completely severable from the price proposal and shall not contain any cost/pricing information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation, TIRNO-09-Q-COB12, provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-31 are incorporated into this RFQ.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210. The small business size standard is $25 million. 

CLIN 0001 Cenzic Hailstorm Professional License - Annual Term Subscription, 5 seats, 2 Named users, seat (Machine ID) based Cenzic Hailstorm Pro Software Maintenance Based on Machine ID's-Includes all software maintenance, upgrades and updates, unlimited number of Web applications, unlimited scans (annual subscription) Cenzic Hailstorm Full Smart Attack Library includes regular library updates and standard support from 5:00 am to 5:00 pm PST.  Period of Performance is March 31, 2009 to March 30, 2010.  The IRS intends to restore coverage for maintenance back to March 31, so your quote should include any applicable reinstatement fees.

CLIN 0002 Hailstorm Professional Training, 2 days, onsite class, up to 10 students.  Travel and expenses not included.

The IRS is seeking competitive RFQs for the following brand name requirement, Cenzic Hailstorm Professional."   The rationale supporting this brand name requirement is that without this scanner software, the IRS will not be able to meet federal mandated compliance monitoring and vulnerability assessment requirements.  The IRS Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRC) is in need of a web-based application specific vulnerability scanner.  Our existing vulnerability scanners (ISS scanner, Nessus, Nmap, and OAT) only performed a handful of vulnerability checks and no tool in our repository did a comprehensive scan of databases.  With over 2100 databases throughout the IRS enterprise, some of which contain extremely sensitive information, it was determined that a more robust database scanner was a necessity.  The Cenzic Hailstorm web-based scanning software was found to be the only product able to scan (at the application layer) the number of different database types: Oracle, MS-SQL, Sybase, and MySQL and handle DB2 on the mainframe, which is an absolute necessity for the IRS.

This is an RFQ and brand name justification to procure Cenzic Hailstorm Professional License and 2-day, on-site training.  The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand names but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent.  All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature to the following email address: Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-31 are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors  Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.

<DESC><p>NIDA intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with The University of Miami for a project titled "The National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) on Drug Abuse." The University of Miami will continue to provide development and implementation of the existing NHSN. The purpose of this contract is to foster drug abuse research and research training among Hispanics and the application of science findings to practice and public health. We anticipate awarding a 5-year contract. Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in the FAR 6.320-1, Only One Responsible Source. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in providing the required services make competition unfeasible.
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (by January 14, 2009) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

SCOPE OF WORK (SOW) FOR RESULTS MONITORING AND EVALUALTION ADVISOR

A.  OVERVIEW: 

Bangladesh has achieved remarkable progress in population and health over the past 30 years.  The total fertility rate has declined dramatically since the early 1970s from 6.3 children per woman to 2.7 in 2007.  Fifty-six percent of currently married women aged 10-49 years use a contraceptive method. Mortality of children under the age of five has declined from 220 to 65 per 1000 live births over the same period. Likewise, infant mortality has more than halved, from 140 to 52 per 1000 live births, and this improvement has also reduced the gender gap in life expectancy that traditionally favored men. The maternal mortality ratio is still high, however, at about 320 per 100,000 live births. More than 85% of births occur in the home without the help of trained birth attendants; and only 20% of infants receive care in the first 3 days of life. This situation contributes to keeping both maternal and neonatal deaths (within the first 30 days of life) high, so until practices change it will be difficult to lower these rates further. There is still an enormous need for family planning services, particularly in low-performing areas of the country.  Nearly 60 percent of postpartum women have an unmet need for family planning, and contraceptive discontinuation is high.  The unmet family planning need for married women of reproductive age is estimated at 15 percent.  Unwanted pregnancy is also very high.

The USAID/Bangladesh Office of Population Health and Nutrition (OPHN) is responsible for planning and managing all USAID assistance in the areas of population and health, and providing advice to Mission management regarding activities and options in these areas.

King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS 
(as numbered):

1) Does not apply to employees employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity as defined and delineated in 29 CFR 
541. (See CFR 4.156)

2) Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer 
System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 
541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;
(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or
(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).
(3) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.
A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.
** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract 
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the 
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at 
http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) 
Web site at http://wdol.gov/.
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard 
Form 1444 (SF 1444)}
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. 
{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the 
Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of 
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to provide answers to questions from potential offeror(s):<BR>	<BR>4.  QUESTION:  For the impact and compression after impact, ASTM D7136 and D7137, are you requiring NDI before and after weight impact and after damaged compressive strength?<BR>ANSWER:  The NDI before and after the impact.  Government will elect whether to do the NDI or not.<BR><BR><BR>5.  QUESTION:  In reference to ASTM D7136, is the government requiring load-displacement data for the drop weigh impact experiment or only compression after impact test results?<BR>ANSWER:  Both the load v. displacement measurements and the compression after impact.  <BR><BR>6.  QUESTION:  Are the use of strain gages required (where called out in method) for determining modulus and strain, or is strength the only parameter that is being assessed for the mechanical property testing?<BR>ANSWER:  We do not require strain gages for all tests. An extensometer may be used for modulus and strain measurements as long as the ASTM spec is followed.  Some tests do require a strain gage and should be priced as such: ASTM D3518-Standard Test Method for In-Plane Shear Response of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials by Tensile Test of +45 degree Laminate, ASTM D7137  Standard Test Method for Compressive Residual Strength Properties of Damaged Polymer matrix Composite Plates, ASTM D5766  Standard Test Method for Open-Hole Tensile Strength of Polymer Matrix Composite Laminates, ASTM D6484  04 Standard Test Method for Open-Hole Compressive<BR><BR><BR>7. QUESTION:  Do all specimens require the pre-conditioning at 160 degree Fahrenheit/85 % RH, or is this only for the 210 degree Fahrenheit/Saturated test? If yes, what type of conditioning is required for the other specimens that are tested at 73 degree Fahrenheit, 210 degree Fahrenheit and -50 degree Fahrenheit?  The test methods have various outcomes or parameters that can be tested.  The outcome/parementer that is chosen effects price.<BR>ANSWER:  Samples are conditioned at there respective testing temperature according to the ASTM standard.  Clarification of the ASMT 5229.  We indicate three testing temperatures and one hot/wet testing temperature.  Condition the samples at the particular testing temperature for 30 days.<BR><BR>8.QUESTION:  Please clarify the hot-wet / 210 degree Fahrenheit, saturated Condition?  We can expose to hot-wet conditions, but cannot control humidity during testing.  <BR>ANSWER:  See answers in QUESTION 7 concerning hot/wet conditions.<BR><BR>9. QUESTION:  Please clarify if all specimens are to be preconditioned at 160 degree Fahrenheit /85% RH, or is this only for the hot wet/condition?<BR>ANSWER:    Adequate temperature and humidity controlled environmental chamber is required for temperature testing.<BR><BR>10.  QUESTION:  For every test method your agency is asking to have tested, you should specify what results you are looking for.  For example, does your agency only need strength data, or are you looking for strain, modulus, etc.?  <BR>ANSWER:  The individual ASTM standard clarifies what data can be obtained from the testing.  We require all available data. For example this includes strength, modulus, fracture strain, stress-strain plots and Poissons ratio for the tension testing.  If the ASTM states and the property can be obtained from testing, we want that.  Use of a laser extensometer or digital image correlation (DIC) camera to track 2D and 3D strain is acceptable.<BR><BR>11.  QUESTION:  Regarding the turn around time:  The acquisition of the proper number of strain gages could in itself take up to two months, the machining could take about four weeks, yet your angency is asking for 30 days of conditioning and the testing will take a significant amount of time due to the volume of work.  A minimum of six months may be needed to do this testing, what is the 90 day requirement based on?<BR>ANSWER:  6 months or sooner is acceptable.<BR><BR>12.  QUESTION:  ASTM D3039  at -50 degree Fahrenheit (ASTM D3039), strain will be measured using extensometers.  Poissons Ratio will not be measured.  Please specify if tabs are required?<BR>ANSWER:   Tabs will be required if your grips crush the samples.  Poissons ratio is required. <BR><BR>13.QUESTION:  ASTM D7264  at -50 degree Fahrenheit  please specify if you require three or four point bending?<BR>ANSWER:  4 pt bend <BR><BR>14. QUESTION:  For ASTM D6671- Interlaminar Fracture Toughness at -50 degree Fahrenheit (ASTM D6671), is the government going to put an insert at the midplane of the laminate during layup for delamination initiation, prior to sending the panel to the contractor for testing?<BR>ANSWER:  We use a 2 mil TFPE film and will provide the appropriate panels.<BR><BR>15.QUESTION:  For ASTM D7137  Does the government want more than strength tested at -50 degree Fahrenheit for ASTM 7137?<BR>ANSWER:  Contractor shall be able to calculate both strength and effective modulus from D7137, compression after impact.<BR><BR>16.  QUESTION: For ASTM D6484  Does the government want more than strength tested for Open-Hole Compressive Strength at  50 degree Fahrenheit (ASTM D6484)?<BR>ANSWER:  Compression strength only<BR><BR>The date and time for receipt of the bids has been changed to 04/03/2009, by 11:59AM EST.

<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>"After-relieved tax," means any amount of tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been payable on the transactions or property covered by this contract, but which the Contractor is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Contractor obtains a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.</p>

<p>(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.</p>
<p>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--</p>
<p>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or</p>
<p>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).</p>
<p>(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.</p>
<p>(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</p>
<p>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--</p>
<p>(i) Making a correct payment;</p>
<p>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and</p>
<p>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.</p>
<p>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--</p>
<p>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.</p>
<p>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

National and Agency PrioritiesThe Vision for Space Exploration drives NASAs Strategic Goals for the period 2006through 2016. Proposers responding to a NASA CAN may become familiar with the 2006 NASAStrategic Plan by accessing http://www.nasa.gov. The 2006 Strategic Plan establishes theframework to advance NASAs unique competencies in scientific and engineering systems tofulfill the Agencys purpose and achieve the NASA Mission: To pioneer the future in spaceexploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research.Although NASA will assume the lead for our Nation in the implementation of thisexplorationvision, this will be a joint journey with contributions by other nations, commercialorganizations,and thousands of university researchers, private sector scientists, engineers, andentrepreneurs from around the globe, all committed to the same objective.II.	NASA Education Strategy and FrameworkAs identified in the 2006 NASA Strategic Plan, education is one of the Agencyscross-cuttingmanagement strategies. NASA will continue the Agencys tradition of investing in theNationseducation programs and supporting the countrys educators who play a key role inpreparing,inspiring, exciting, encouraging, and nurturing the young minds of today that will manageandlead the Nations laboratories and research centers of tomorrow.A highly educated and well-prepared workforce has been and continues to be critical tothesuccess of the Agencys mission. NASAs investment in education is directly linked toinspiringthe next generation of explorers and innovators.Beginning in 2006 NASA began pursuing three major education goals:	Strengthen NASA and the Nations future workforceNASA will identify and developthe critical skills and capabilities needed to ensure achievement of the Vision for SpaceExploration. To help meet this demand, NASA will continue contributing to the developmentof the Nations science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce of thefuture through a diverse portfolio of education initiatives that target Americasstudents at all levels, especially those in traditionally underserved andunderrepresented communities.	Attract and retain students in STEM disciplinesNASA will focus on engaging andretaining students in STEM education programs to encourage their pursuit of educationaldisciplines and careers critical to NASAs future engineering, scientific, and technicalmissions.  	Engage Americans in NASAs missionNASA will build strategic partnerships andlinkages between STEM formal and informal education providers. Through hands-on,interactive educational activities, NASA will engage students, educators, families, thegeneral public, and all Agency stakeholders to increase Americans science and technologyliteracy.To achieve these goals, NASA Education developed three Education Outcomes. The EducationOutcomes form a critical component of the Education Strategic Coordination Framework (seeAppendix A).  The three Outcomes are as follows:	Outcome 1: Contribute to the development of the STEM workforce in disciplinesneeded to achieve NASAs strategic goals through a portfolio of investments.	Outcome 2: Attract and retain students in STEM disciplines through a progressionof educational opportunities for students, teachers, and faculty.	Outcome 3: Build strategic partnerships and linkages between STEM formal andinformal education providers that promote STEM literacy and awareness of NASAs mission.The Framework guides the planning, implementation, and assessment of the NASA Educationportfolio and provides a coordinated tool to describe the Overarching Philosophy andOperatingPrinciples for NASA education. Higher education projects serve as major links in thestudentpipeline used to address the education outcomes.Outcome 1 of the NASA Education portfolio includes six NASA Performance Assessment andRating Tool (PART) higher education metrics.  This NRA is intended to focus on projects specifically designed to contribute to these particular metrics.  The six Outcome 1 PARTmetrics are:	Number of new or revised courses targeted at STEM skills needed by NASA that aredeveloped with NASA support. 	Number of institutions served in designated Experimental Program to StimulateCompetitive Research (EPSCoR) states.  (See Appendix C for EPSCoR link)	Number of underrepresented and underserved students participating in NASAeducation programs. 	Percentage of student participants employed by NASA, aerospace contractors,universities, & other educational institutions.	Percentage of undergraduate students who move on to advanced education in NASArelated disciplines. 	Percentage of higher education program participants who have participated in NASAelementary or secondary programs. III.	  Description of OpportunityNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center is releasingthis Announcement of Opportunity (NRA) proposal for NASA Minority University Research andEducation Programs (MUREP) Small Programs (MSP) Competitive Grants (MSPCG). This effortwill seek innovate approaches to using NASA-themed content in support of higher educationteaching and learning.	Each funded proposal is expected to leverage NASAs uniquescience and exploration missions and contributions in science, technology, engineering,and mathematics (STEM) to enhance students academic experiences and/or to improveeducators abilities to engage and stimulate their students.  The outcomes of theproposal shall support NASA education PART metrics for higher education.  The targetstudents shall be enrolled at an accredited college or university, with a declared STEMmajor, or shall be pre-service teachers.   Proposed work must be grounded in educationresearch and/or best practices, and incorporate formative, summative, and otherevaluations, as appropriate.	The MSPCG activity will consider proposals that use the STEM content of NASAs missionsto:	Develop, promote, or utilize new, innovative, and replicable approaches toimproving STEM learning and instruction in support of NASA's reporting metrics; and	Provide experiences and activities that are grounded in education research orutilize evidence-supported approaches, techniques, and tools.The proposed work shall be new or innovative projects that directly support NASA PARThigher education metrics.  These metrics support NASA's education portfolio, specificallyOutcome 1 (Higher Education): Contribute to the development of the STEM workforce indisciplines needed to achieve NASAs strategic goal through a portfolio of investments. NASAs Education Framework is detailed in Appendix A, with links for more information. Funded proposals shall be innovative and clearly provide evidence that the project cansupport at least one of the Outcome 1 PART metrics, as defined in Appendix A. Information about NASAs missions can be found in Appendix B.  Funding authorization for this NRA is provided through Public Law 110-161. Awards will bemade in the form of grants or cooperative agreements, following guidance described inTitle 31 United States Code Section 6305. IV.		Project Overview and GuidelinesA.	Background Recent programmatic reviews and recommendations from external organizations andcommittees have reinforced the validity of the underlying principles of the educationframework: relevance, emphasis on NASA content, diversity, evaluation, continuity, andpartnerships for sustainability. They also emphasized a need for projects and activitiesto be grounded in education research, and/or based on research evidence and bestpractices. Proposers must reference education research, best practices to be employed, or otherevidence supporting their rationale for their approach, tools, or techniques.  NASA doesnot endorse or require the use of any specific source of information, but does encouragethe proposer to survey research and best practices described in peer reviewed journalsand credible organizations specializing in STEM education research. See Sections VI andVII for guidance in proposal preparation.B.	Overview Awards will be made for work that results in a deliverable using the STEM content ofNASAs missions to develop, promote, or utilize new, innovative, and replicableapproaches to improving STEM learning and instruction in support of NASA's Outcome 1 PARTreporting metrics.  This NRA is specifically targeting new and innovative ideas whichshall directly support at least one of the Outcome 1 PART reporting metrics as detailedin Appendix A.	 Higher Education supports students and faculty at universities andcolleges to strengthen their research capabilities and provide opportunities that attractand prepare increasing numbers of students for NASA-related careers.  Participation inNASA programs and research can stimulate increasing numbers of students to continue theirstudies at all levels of the higher education continuum and to earn advanced STEMdegrees.  In addition, NASA funded research conducted at the institutions of highereducation will contribute to the research needs of NASA's Mission Directorates.  Detailedinformation on NASA's Mission Directorates is provided in Appendix B.MUREP projects focus on strengthening the academic and research infrastructure ofMinority Serving Institutions and attracting and preparing students in STEM disciplines,and support their completion of undergraduate and graduate degrees with the ultimate goalof providing access to careers in the scientific and technical workforce.  Successfulproposals may foster new aerospace science and technology development concepts, providemechanisms for expanded participation by faculty and students of MSIs in mainstreamresearch, or increase the number of underrepresented and underserved U.S. studentsobtaining advanced degrees in NASA-related fields and entering the aerospace workforce. NASA engages under-represented populations through engaging minority institutions,faculty and students in research pertinent to NASA missions, and encouraging completionof degrees and entry into the workforce.Potential deliverables may include the following, although all innovative ideas will beconsidered:	Targeted student participation in individual and collaborative scientific andengineering research.	Education projects that will strengthen the scientific and technicalinfrastructure of participating institutions in EPSCoR states.	(See Appendix C forEPSCoR link.)	Education activities designed to develop and/or enhance specific STEM knowledgeand skills using NASA resources.  NASAs higher education efforts may include developmentof specific university curricula in support of the NASA mission and student-builtinstruments.  	Proposals that increase usage of and/or add value to existing educationresources, including repurposing existing NASA products, materials, projects, andleveraging supporting infrastructures.	Use of existing content developed by NASA is alsoencouraged.    	Targeted development of individuals who prepare for employment in disciplinesneeded to achieve NASAs mission and strategic goals.  	Professional development opportunities for pre-service educators, related to NASAcontent and targeting elementary and secondary education.Proposers are also referred to the NASA Education home page  at http://education.nasa.govfor a list of existing education projects and resources.C.	Award Range and Performance Period It is anticipated that approximately 3-4 awards, ranging from $50K - $350K each ($840Ktotal has been allocated for this solicitation), for a one-year period of performance maybe made under this NRA, pursuant to the authority of the NASA Grant and CooperativeAgreement Handbook (http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/hq/grcover.htm), Section 1260.12(d). Successful projects will be eligible for renewal for up to two additional years, based onproject performance and funds availability.  NASA reserves the right to partially fundprojects, limit the number of projects funded, or limit the funding level below theallocated amount.D.

OverviewHigh achievement in STEM education is essential to the accomplishment of NASAs mission.NASA contributes to national efforts for achieving excellence in STEM education through acomprehensive education portfolio implemented by the Office of Education, the MissionDirectorates, and the NASA Centers. The NASA Education Strategic Coordination Framework: A Portfolio Approach describes thealignment of NASAs education portfolio with the 2006 NASA Strategic Plan and creates anagency-wide strategic planning, implementation and evaluation framework for NASAsinvestments in education. The plan encompasses all education efforts undertaken by NASAand guides the Agencys relationships with external education partners.  Proposers arestrongly encouraged to become familiar with this document, which can be downloaded fromwww.nasa.gov/pdf/189101main_Education_Framework.pdf.  An informative overview isavailable at http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bose/NASA_1_Presentation_Winterton.pdf. II.	Education GoalsNASA is pursuing three major education goals:	Strengthen NASA and the Nations future workforceNASA will identify and developthe critical skills and capabilities needed to ensure achievement of its missionpriorities. To help meet this demand, NASA will continue contributing to the developmentof the Nations STEM workforce of the future through a diverse portfolio of educationinitiatives that target Americas students at all levels, especially those intraditionally underserved and underrepresented communities.	Attract and retain students in STEM disciplinesTo compete effectively for theminds, imaginations, and career ambitions of Americas young people, NASA will focus onengaging and retaining students in STEM education programs to encourage their pursuit ofeducational disciplines critical to NASAs future engineering, scientific, and technicalmissions.	Engage Americans in NASAs missionNASA will build strategic partnerships andlinkages between STEM formal and informal education providers. Through hands-on,interactive educational activities, NASA will engage students, educators, families, thegeneral public, and all Agency stakeholders to increase Americans science and technologyliteracy.III.		Education Outcomes and ObjectivesThree associated outcomes align all education activities:	Outcome 1 (Higher Education): Contribute to the development of the STEM workforcein disciplines needed to achieve NASAs strategic goal through a portfolio ofinvestments.	Outcome 2 (Elementary and Secondary Education): Attract and retain students inSTEM disciplines through a progression of educational opportunities for students,teachers, and faculty.	Outcome 3 (Informal Education): Build strategic partnerships and linkages betweenSTEM formal and informal education providers that promote STEM literacy and awareness ofNASAs mission.These outcomes are intended to 	Provide educators with unique teaching tools, compelling teaching experiences,and world-class research experiences; inspire students through hands-on activities topursue careers in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology; and make use ofcurrent and emerging information and communication technology to extend the reach ofNASAs education activities. 	Improve students problem-solving skills, and competence in and appreciation ofSTEM disciplines, and enhance the scientific and technological literacy of the Americanpublic. The MSPCG project directly supports Outcome 1 of the NASA Education portfolio bycontributing to the accomplishment of the following associated PART metrics: 	Number of new or revised courses targeted at STEM skills needed by NASA that aredeveloped with NASA support. 	Number of institutions served in designated EPSCoR states. 	Number of underrepresented and underserved students participating in NASAeducation programs. 	Percentage of student participants employed by NASA, aerospace contractors,universities, & other educational institutions. 	Percentage of undergraduate students who move on to advanced education in NASArelated disciplines. 	Percentage of higher education program participants who have participated in NASAelementary or secondary programs. Proposals funded under this announcement shall be expected to contribute data to supportNASA Educations PART measurements for higher education.  Successful proposals shallindicate  ability to support at least one of these metrics.  PART measure results for2008 are available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/detail/10002310.2008.html. Appendix B:  Strategic Framework for NASAI.	Global Exploration StrategyIn December 2006, the release of the Global Exploration Strategy: The Framework forCoordination identified space exploration as a global partnership in service of society.It requires both human endeavor and technological innovation and it will deliver newknowledge and commercial opportunity. The strategy, agreed to by fourteen space agencies,presents a vision for robotic and human space exploration, focusing on destinationswithin the solar system where humans may one day live and work. It describes an actionplan to share the strategies and efforts of individual nations so that all can achievetheir exploration goals more effectively and safely. The strategy identifies fiveexploration themes: new knowledge in science and technology, a sustained presence toextend human frontiers, economic expansion, global partnership, and inspiration andeducation. (http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/main/index.html)II.	NASA MissionsNASAs Mission to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery, andaeronautics research, draws support from four Mission Directorates, each with a specificresponsibility. 	The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) leads the Agency in four areas of research:Earth Science, Heliophysics, Planetary Science, and Astrophysics. SMD works closely withthe broader scientific community, considers national initiatives, and uses the results ofNational Research Council studies to define a set of Big Questions in each of thesefour research areas. These questions, in turn, fuel mission priorities and the SMDresearch agenda. The SMD also sponsors research that both enables, and is enabled by,NASAs exploration activities. SMD has a portfolio of Education and Public Outreachprojects that are connected to its research efforts.  (http://nasascience.nasa.gov) 	The Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Agency role is to develop asustained human presence on the moon; to promote exploration, commerce, and U.S.preeminence in space; and to serve as a stepping-stone for the future exploration of Marsand other destinations. ESMD establishes the NASA exploration research and technologydevelopment agenda. Specifically, ESMD develops capabilities and supporting research andtechnology that will enable sustained and affordable human and robotic exploration. Italso works to ensure the health and performance of crews during long-duration spaceexploration. In the near-term, ESMD does this by developing robotic precursor missions,human transportation elements, and life-support systems.(http://www.exploration.nasa.gov)	The Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD) provides the Agency withleadership and management of NASA space operations related to human exploration in andbeyond low-Earth orbit. SOMD enables current space exploration in low earth orbit throughits Space Shuttle and International Space Station Programs. SOMD is also responsible forAgency leadership and management of NASA space operations related to Launch Services,Space Transportation, and Space Communications in support of both human and roboticexploration programs.  (http://www.spaceoperations.nasa.gov)	The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) conducts vital research tomake air travel more efficient, safe, green, and to uncover leading-edge solutions forthe Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) in the United States. ARMDsfundamental research in traditional aeronautical disciplines and emerging disciplineshelps address substantial noise, emissions, efficiency, performance and safety challengesthat must be met in order to design vehicles that can operate in the NextGen.(http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov)Appendix C:  NASA Education Resources AvailableThis list is not intended to limit or restrict proposer creativity, and is notcomprehensive of all resources available.

Proposers are responsible forunderstanding and complying with its procedures for the successful, timely preparationand submission of their proposals. Proposals that do not conform to its standards may bedeclared noncompliant and rejected without review. The introductory material, as well as the appendices, of the NASA Guidebook for Proposersprovide additional information about the entire NRA process, including NASA policies forthe solicitation of proposals, guidelines for writing complete and effective proposals,and NASAs general policies and procedures for the review and selection of proposals andfor issuing and managing the awards to the institutions that submitted selectedproposals. II.	Content and Form of the Proposal Submission A.	Electronic Proposal SubmissionAll proposals submitted in response to this NRA must be submitted in a fully electronicform. No hard copy of the proposal will be accepted. The NOI may be submitted by thePrincipal Investigator (PI).  Proposers submitting a Full Proposal must have the finalversion of proposals submitted by the authorized organization representative (AOR) at theproposal Principal Investigators institution. Electronic submission by the AOR serves asthe required original signature by an authorized official of the proposing institution. Proposers may opt to submit proposals in response to this NRA via either of two differentelectronic proposal submission systems: NSPIRES, located at http://nspires.nasaprs.com(see Appendix E Section II.D below), or Grants.gov located at http://www.grants.gov (seeAppendix E Section II.E below). Proposers should not submit the same proposal to bothelectronic submission systems. NASA plans to use the NSPIRES system to facilitate thereview process so all proposals received through Grants.Gov will be transferred intoNSPIRES.Note carefully the following requirements for submission of an electronic proposalregardless of the intent to submit via NSPIRES or Grants.gov:	Every institution that intends to submit a proposal to NASA in response to thisNRA must be registered in NSPIRES. This applies whether proposals are submitted viaNSPIRES or Grants.gov. Every institution that intends to submit a proposal throughGrants.gov must register under that system as well as NSPIRES. Registration for eitherproposal data system must be performed by an institutions electronic businesspoint-of-contact (EBPOC) in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).	Any institution requesting NASA funds through the proposed investigation must belisted on the Proposal Cover Page. NASA will not fund institutions that do not appear onthe Proposal Cover Page.	Each individual team member named on the proposals electronic cover page must beindividually registered in NSPIRES. This applies whether proposals are submitted viaNSPIRES or Grants.gov.	Each individual team member named on the proposals electronic cover page mustspecify an institutional affiliation. The institutional affiliation specified must be theinstitution through which the team member is participating in the proposed investigation.If the individual has multiple affiliations, then this institution may be different fromthe individuals primary employer or preferred mailing address.Generically, an electronic proposal consists of one or more electronic forms, includingan electronic cover page and one or more attachments. The attachments contain allsections of the proposal, including the project description as well as all required andallowed appendices; see Appendix E Section II.B below for further requirements. Submission of electronic proposals via either NSPIRES or Grants.gov requires severalcoordinated actions from the proposing institution. In particular, when the PI hascompleted entry of the data requested in the required electronic forms and attachment ofthe allowed PDF attachments, including the project description section, an official atthe PIs institution who is authorized to make such a submission, referred to as theauthorized organization representative (AOR), must submit the electronic proposal (formsplus attachments). Coordination between the PI and his/her AOR on the final editing andsubmission of the proposal materials is facilitated through their respective accounts inNSPIRES and/or Grants.gov. Note that if one individual is acting in both the PI and AORroles, he/she must ensure that all steps in the process are taken, including submittingthe proposal from the institution.B. Proposal Format and ContentsAll proposals submitted in response to this NRA must include the appropriate requiredelectronic forms available through either of two proposal submission systems, NSPIRES orGrants.gov. The project description and other required sections of the proposal must be submitted assearchable, unlocked PDF files that are attached to the electronic submission using oneof the proposal submission systems. Proposers must comply with any format requirementsspecified in this NRA and in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, Section 2.3. Onlyappendices/attachments that are specifically requested in either this NRA or in the NASAGuidebook for Proposers will be permitted; proposals containing additionalappendices/attachments may be declared noncompliant. The NASA Guidebook for Proposers,Section 2, provides detailed discussions of the content of proposals applicable to thisNRA. Section VII Proposal Preparation of this NRA provides a listing of required contentelements.In the event the information in this NRA is different from or contradicts the informationin the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, the information in this NRA takes precedence.Important note on creating PDF files for upload: It is essential that all PDF filesgenerated and submitted meet the NASA requirements below. This will ensure that thesubmitted files can be transferred into NSPIRES regardless of whether the proposal issubmitted via NSPIRES or Grants.gov. At a minimum, it is the responsibility of theproposer to: (1) ensure that all PDF files are unlocked and that edit permission isenabled  this is necessary to allow NSPIRES to concatenate submitted files into a singlePDF document; and (2) ensure that all fonts are embedded in the PDF file and that onlyType 1 or TrueType fonts are used. In addition, any proposer who creates files using TeXor LaTeX is required to first create a DVI file and then convert the DVI file toPostscript and then to PDF.  See http://nspires.nasaprs.com/tutorials/PDF_Guidelines.pdffor more information on creating PDF documents that are compliant with NSPIRES.  PDFfiles that do not meet the NASA requirements cannot be transferred into the NSPIRESsystem; such files may be declared noncompliant and not submitted for evaluation.C. Additional Requirement for Budget Format In addition to the budget summary information provided in the NSPIRES or Grants.govCover Page forms, all proposers are required to include more detailed budgets and budgetjustifications, including detailed subcontract/subaward budgets, in a format of their ownchoosing in the Budget Justification. For this NRA, this additional budget must bedivided into two parts, the Budget Justification: Narrative and the BudgetJustification: Details, both as described in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, Section2.3.10.The Budget Justification: Narrative includes the Table of Proposed Work Effort and thedescription of facilities and equipment, as well as the rationale and basis of estimatefor all components of cost including procurements, travel (destination, purpose andnumber of travelers), publication costs, and all subawards/subcontracts. The Table ofProposed Work Effort must include the names and/or titles of all personnel (includingpostdoctoral fellows and graduate students, where known) necessary to perform theproposed investigation regardless of whether these individuals require funding from thecurrent proposal. The number of person-months each person is expected to devote to theproject must be given for each year. The Budget Justification: Details must include thedetailed proposed budget including all of the Other Direct Costs and Other ApplicableCosts specified in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers. Note that failure to provide sufficient budget justification and data in the BudgetJustification: Narrative (including the Table of Proposed Work Effort) and the BudgetJustification: Details will prevent the peer review from appropriately evaluating thecost realism of the proposed effort. A finding by the peer review of insufficientinformation to properly evaluate cost realism will be considered a proposal weakness.Inconsistent information between these budget descriptions and the proposal text willalso be considered a proposal weakness.D. Submission of Proposals via NSPIRES, the NASA Proposal Data SystemIn order to submit a proposal via NSPIRES, this NRA requires that the proposer registerkey data concerning the intended submission with NSPIRES; NSPIRES can be accessed athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com. Potential applicants are urged to access this site well inadvance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with itsstructure and enter the requested identifier information. It is especially important to note that every individual named on the proposalselectronic Cover Page form (see below) as a proposing team member in any role, includingCo-Investigators and collaborators, must be registered in NSPIRES and that suchindividuals must perform this registration themselves; no one may register a secondparty, even the Principal Investigator of a proposal in which that person is committed toparticipate. This data site is secure and all information entered is strictly for NASAsuse only. All proposals submitted via NSPIRES in response to this NRA must include a requiredelectronic Cover Page form that is accessed at http://nspires.nasaprs.com. This form iscomprised of several distinct sections: a Cover Page that contains the identifierinformation for the proposing institution and personnel; a Proposal Summary that providesan overview of the proposed investigation that is suitable for release through a publiclyaccessible archive should the proposal be selected; and a Budget Summary of the proposedresearch effort. Unless specified in the program description itself, no other forms arerequired for proposal submission via NSPIRES. See the NASA Guidebook for Proposers,Sections 2 and 3, for further details. The required elements of the proposal, including the project description, must besubmitted as one or more PDF documents that are attached to the Cover Page using thetools in NSPIRES. It is possible to submit the entire proposal as a single, searchable,unlocked PDF document, including the project description section and budgetjustification, assembled in the order provided in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers,Section 2.3, and uploaded using the tools in NSPIRES. One advantage of submitting theentire proposal as one PDF document is that it is easier for the proposer to create atable of contents that will be correct. If separate files are uploaded, there may beslight differences in page numbering due to the concatenation process. Any mismatch withthe table of contents caused by this process does not impact the evaluation of theproposal. NSPIRES will provide a list of all elements that make up an electronic proposal, and thesystem will conduct an element check to identify any item(s) that is (are) apparentlymissing or incomplete. The element check may produce warnings and/or identify errors.Uploading the proposal in one PDF file is likely to create warnings as part of theelement check. These warnings should be ignored as warnings do not preclude proposalsubmission. Note, however, an error in the element check will preclude submission.Proposers are encouraged to begin their submission process early. Tutorials and otherNSPIRES help topics may be accessed through the NSPIRES online help site athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/help.do. For any questions that cannot be resolvedwith the available on-line help menus, requests for assistance may be directed by e-mailto nspires-help@nasaprs.com or by telephone to (202) 479-9376, Monday through Friday,8:00 a.m.  6:00 p.m. Eastern Time.E. Submission of Proposals via Grants.gov In furtherance of the Presidents Management Agenda, NASA offers proposers the option toutilize Grants.gov to prepare and submit proposals in response to this NRA. Grants.govallows institutions to electronically find and apply for competitive grant opportunitiesfrom all Federal grant-making agencies; it provides a single access point for over 1000grant programs offered by the 26 Federal grant-making agencies. The U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services is the managing partner for Grants.gov. In order to submit a proposal via Grants.gov, Grants.gov requires that the PrincipalInvestigator download an application package from Grants.gov. Identifying the appropriateapplication package requires the funding opportunity number for that program; the fundingopportunity number may be found in the Summary of Key Information subsection thatconcludes each program description. Proposals submitted via Grants.gov must be submittedby the AOR. Submitting a proposal via Grants.gov requires the following steps: 	Follow Grants.gov instructions provided at the website to download any softwaretools or applications required to submit to Grants.gov. 	Download the application package from Grants.gov at http://www.grants.gov.Download the application package from Grants.gov by selecting Download grant applicationpackages under Apply for Grants at http://www.grants.gov. 	Complete the required Grants.gov forms including the SF424 (R&R) Application forFederal Assistance, R&R Other Project Information, R&R Senior/Key Person Profile, and R&RBudget. Every named individual must be identified with the institution through which theyare participating in the proposal, regardless of their place of permanent employment orpreferred mailing address.	Complete the required NASA specific forms: NASA Other Project Information, NASAPrincipal Investigator and Authorized Representative Supplemental Data Sheet, NASASenior/Key Person Supplemental Data Sheet (this form is only required if there areSenior/Key Persons other than the Principal Investigator). 	Complete any NASA program-specific forms that may be required. Program-specificforms may be found by clicking on the hyperlink in the NASA Other Project Informationform or by directly accessing http://nspires.nasaprs.com/Grants.gov . Directions foraccessing and submitting program-specific forms, if there are any, are provided in theNASA Other Project Information form. 	Create a proposal in PDF including the project description and all other requiredproposal sections (see the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, Section 2). Upload sections asseparate PDFs as prompted by Grants.gov.	Submit the proposal via the authorized organization representative (AOR); theproposal Principal Investigator may not submit the application to Grants.gov unlesshe/she is an AOR. 	Grant researchers do NOT need to register with Grants.gov. However, everyindividual named in the proposal as a proposing team member in any role, including PI,Co-Investigators and collaborators, must be registered in NSPIRES(http://nspires.nasaprs.com) and that such individuals must perform this registrationthemselves; no one may register a second party, even the PI of a proposal in which thatperson is committed to participate. This data site is secure and all information enteredis strictly for NASAs use only.Potential applicants are urged to access Grants.gov site well in advance of the proposaldue date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and download theappropriate application packages and tools. Additional instructions for formatting and submitting proposals via Grants.gov may befound in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, Sections 2 and 3. Instructions for the use ofGrants.gov may be found in the Grants.gov User Guide athttp://www.grants.gov/CustomerSupport. Instructions for NASA-specific forms and NASAprogram-specific forms may be found in the application package and athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/Grants.gov . For any questions that cannot be resolved withthe available on-line help menus and documentation, requests for assistance may bedirected by e-mail to support@grants.gov or by telephone to (800) 518-4726. III.	Notice of Intent to ProposeA Notice of Intent (NOI) is required. The information contained in an NOI will be used toinform merit reviewer expertise and requirements.  NOI must be submitted through NSPIRES.Note that NOI may be submitted within NSPIRES directly by the proposal PrincipalInvestigator. All NOIs require concurrence from the AOR.Grants.gov does not provide NOI capability; therefore, NOIs must be submitted via NSPIRESregardless of whether the proposal will be submitted via NSPIRES or Grants.gov.Interested proposers must register with NSPIRES before it can be accessed for use; seeAppendix E, Section II.A above. IV.	Proposal Funding Restrictions In addition to the funding restrictions and requirements given in the NASA Guidebook forProposers and the Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook, the following restrictionsare applicable to this NRA:	The estimated funding and number of proposals anticipated to be funded, as shownin this NRA under the section entitled Summary of Key Information, are subject to theavailability of appropriated funds, as well as the submission of a sufficient number ofproposals of adequate merit. 	The construction of facilities is not an allowed activity for any of the programssolicited in this NRA. For further information on permissible costs, refer to the costprinciples cited in the Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook, Section 1260.127. 	Travel is allowed as may be necessary for the meaningful completion of theproposed investigation. Foreign travel has an upper limit of $1,500 per proposal peryear. Domestic travel does not have a cap.V.	Conflict of Interest Check InformationNASA expects all  reviewers to disclose all conflicts of interest, as well as situationswhich may be actual conflicts of interest or which may give the appearance of a conflictof interest. Reviewers are also expected to disclose situations that may give theappearance of bias, or may cause a reasonable observer to question the ability of thereviewer to provide an unbiased evaluation of a proposal (see the NASA Guidebook forProposers, Appendix E.3). Reviewers are required to sign a non-disclosure/conflict ofinterest form prior to being granted access to proposals.Appendix F:  Sample Proposal Cover PageThis is the first page of the multi-page cover produced by NSPIRES.Appendix G:  Useful Web SitesNASA does not endorse or require the use of any specific source of information, but doesencourage the proposer to survey NASA content, and education research and best practicesdescribed in peer reviewed journals and credible organizations specializing in STEMeducation research.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS BEING MODIFIED TO INCLUDE A COPY OF THE JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL PER FAR 6.305.This is a notice of a proposed contract action published to notify potential sources that the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in Minneapolis, MN contracting office intends to issue a sole source interim contract award to Quest Diagnostics for Reference Laboratory Testing services for the VSIN 23 Medical Center laboratories.  The reference laboratory testing services are crucial to providing patient care services and the VA cannot have uninterrupted services.Due to the interfacing requirement for reporting patient test results and the need to temporarily continue this service, the VAMC in Minneapolis, MN will award a sole source contract to the incumbent contractor, Quest Diagnostics to meet this interim need for the VISN 23 laboratories. The period of performance for this interim contract is April 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009.  The estimated value of this VISN 23 contract is $700,000.00. In order to meet future requirements we anticipate issuing a competitive solicitation on or about June 1, 2009.The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Therefore, this sole source award is being made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) (2), only one responsible source and no other company will satisfy agency requirements because the incumbent offers a service not otherwise available to the Government due to the interfacing requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible interested persons may respond with their interest and capability by submitting a proposal, capability statement or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Any inquires to this sole source acquisition must be submitted in writing to the attention of Corinne Nygren at The Department of Veterans Affairs, Contracting - Room 208, 708 South 3rd Street, Suite 200E, Minneapolis, MN  55415-1116, or by email to Corinne.Nygren@va.gov. Requests by telephone will not be honored.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>This contract action was awarded competitvely utilizing FAR Part 35 procedures. This contract was awarded on a cost reimbursment basis in accordance with FAR 16.301-2  because the risks and the uncertainties involved are acute making it difficult to estimate costs with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The primary objective of the program is to conduct Phase I of the BioJET program in the area of process development, process integration, fuel qualification, end-user testing, and economic planning.  The ultimate objective of this program is to develop an end-to-end process for commercially viable production of BioJET  JP-8 spec jet fuel from biomass.

Height increases, greater than two (2) feet, have the potential to expand the levee footprint, up to a maximum of twelve (12) feet on each side of the existing levee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Therefore an architectural survey and evaluation of architectural/engineering buildings, levees, and structures, including subsurface features (e.g. irrigation ditches) located along the entire RGCP is required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC><p>1. Many calls were received concerning a debrief regarding this sources sought. Rather than take all these calls and return calls, questions will be answered below.</p>
<p>A sources sought falls under FAR Part 10 Market Research. This was not a Request for Proposal rather a Sources Sought which is a vehicle used to access the market's capability, determine the acquisition strategy, and to determine the role of small business in attaining our goal.</p>
<p>2. Why did the Corps of Engineers choose Bristol Environmental Remediation Services, LLC, Anchorage, Alaska to perform for this project?</p>
<p>There are several reasons we chose Bristol for this project as follows:</p>
<p>St. Lawrence Island is located in the middle of the Bering Sea; the work season on St. Lawrence Island is restricted due to extreme weather conditions and a short construction season. Knowing the window of opportunity is small for St. Lawrence Island and provided work on St. Lawrence needed to occur this season, the government determined to award this acquisition in the most expeditious way allowable for project success.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned, the government chose to award this acquisition to a Sole Source 8(a) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.8. This approach was reasonable and Bristol was chosen for the following reasons: a) the logistical window for scheduling goes away as resources are extreme and limited for St. Lawrence Island b) this work must begin immediately and be completed by summer June 2010 c) due to the urgency of securing mobilization services for the 2009 summer field season, and their familiarity with St. Lawrence Island, it became abundantly clear that Bristol Environmental possesses significant logistical knowledge from past performance on St. Lawrence Island d) Bristol has adeptly demonstrated there ability to mobilize to an extreme remote site and perform under very difficult conditions with great care winning the Northeast Cape Annual Corp's Safety Award twice e) further, Bristol Environmental has pre-established agreements with the landowners f) and has found favor with the local Native population as demonstrated with their recent selection by the Native Village of Savoonga to be their consultant on a Native American Lands Environmental Mitigation Program project.</p>
<p>After careful review and consideration it was determined that Bristol Environmental Remediation Services, LLC would be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>3. What can we do to be more competitive with our proposals?</p>
<p>Response: This was a sources sought notice and not a request for proposal, no cost information was requested or provided. This notice was used as a vehicle for market research to investigate innovative methods for performing the work.</p>
<p>We appreciate the information provided which help us determine the best approach for this work and thank you for you for responding to our market research. Your firm's input is valuable to us and we cannot do what we do without industry help and knowledge which benefits all of us. The US Army Corps of Engineers Alaska District thanks you for your participation.</p>
