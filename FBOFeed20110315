The fuels reduction will occure on National Forest lands adjacent to private lands.  This will require the contractor concern for stand visuals after treatment and the protection of private property during the treatment.  This project will have three bid items, 2 mechanical bid items and 1 thin with hand piling bid item.

The location of this project is on the Northern Hills Ranger District, Lawrence county, South Dakota.  

All responsible sources may submit a bid which will be considered by the Government. In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the CCR on part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//. 

The solicitation with all specifications and statement of work is scheduled to be posted on FBO late March 2010.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Population Genetics (LPG), plans to procure the brand name Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 EZ Bead System manufactured by Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Dr., Foster City, CA 94404.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard in 500.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Delivery: 2 weeks after receipt of purchase order</p>
<p>The overall mission of the LPG is to understand the genetic etiology of cancer and its related phenotypes. LPG undertakes this mission through a systems approach, integrating genetics with multiple high-throughput molecular characterizations enabled through bioinformatics. LPG's systems strategy utilizes experimental design and analytic approaches that result in reduced data complexity which allows identification of amplified relative signal to noise ratios, making it feasible to extract insights from the complex adaptive system that underpins cancer etiology. In order to validate and extend these findings, the LPG will be carrying out whole genome sequencing - both at the DNA and RNA levels. In order to accomplish this goal and continue ongoing research, the LPG seeks to purchase a SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> EZ Bead<sup>TM</sup> System to enable execution of the experiments that are critical for our ongoing research projects at LPG. This bead system will allow LPG to carry out automated preparation (library construction, bead preparation, and bead amplification) for the next generation sequencing experiments with the current staffing resources. LPG requires that this bead preparation system be compatible with the existing SOLiD NextGen Sequencing instrument currently in the laboratory.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide one SOLiD EZ Bead System (4448417) which includes: EZ Bead Emulsifier (4448419), EZ Bead Amplifier (4448418), and EZ Bead Enricher (4448420.</p>
<p>Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. Statutory authority:</p>
<p><br />Statute: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p>The SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> EZ Bead<sup>TM</sup> System is specifically designed to work with the AB SOLiD Next Generation Sequencers. The SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> EZ Bead<sup>TM</sup> System helps manage next-generation sequencing workflows by providing an automated solution for reproducible templated bead preparation with less than 1 hour of hands-on time. This system is specifically designed with system modularity and quality control check points for greater experimental control and higher success rates. The SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> EZ Bead<sup>TM</sup> System streamlines the sequencing workflow through significant time savings and support for up to 96 multiplexed libraries. With automation, minimal costs, and seamless effort, the SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> EZ Bead<sup>TM</sup> System dramatically increases sequencing productivity to further accelerate scientific discovery. <br /><br />Since the LPG already has a SOLiD Next Generation Sequencer, this bead system must be compatible with that sequencer and must meet the following requirements:<br /><br />1) designed and validated exclusively for use with SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> Sequencing Analyzers to provide an automated solution for templated bead preparation;<br />2) enable quality control check points for greater experimental control. Protocols for quality control must be available prior to bead enrichment; <br />3) use AB uniquely designed 1 micron beads to minimize ePCR reagent volumes;<br />4) reproducibly generate up to 1 billion beads per run for sequencing throughputs of up to 50 GB per slide in less than 1 hour of system hands-on time;<br />5) come with prepackaged and validated reagents for use with SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> Sequencing Analyzers;<br />6) validated to accommodate all existing SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> Sequencing Analyzer library types including fragment, paired-end, and mate paired libraries;<br />7) produce templated beads for massively parallel sequencing on the SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> System from as little as 500 pM amplifiable library DNA input derived from source DNA or RNA;<br />8) support multiplexing of up to 96 bar-coded library preparations per run for DNA or RNA based applications;<br />9) have validated reagent kits and consumables configured for each bead output scale and for single use to help prevent cross contamination;<br />10) designed to contain instruments for: emulsion creation, clonal amplification onto beads, and emulsion break and bead enrichment;<br />11) The System's modularity must allow for flexibility and scalability specific to the customer's throughput and workflow and number of SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> Sequencing Analyzers supported;<br />12) provide a template load of &gt;60,000 copies per bead;<br />13) provide a total run time of approximately 8 hours, regardless of the scale. The emulsification step should have a run time of approximately 30 minutes, the amplification should have a run time of approximately 3.5 hours and the enrichment step should be approximately 3.5 hours;<br />14) must provide self-contained consumables and automated decontamination procedures to minimize cross contamination between samples.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on March 29, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, atwardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.

The objective of the Framingham Heart Study is to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources.</p>
<p>The SABRe Initiative is a state-of-the-art research enterprise to advance personalized medicine through biomarker discovery and validation. This project holds great promise for identifying mechanisms of disease and promoting the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases of high impact.</p>
<p>The specific aims for SABRe CVD are as follows:<br />1. To identify the biomarker signatures of atherosclerosis as determined by: a) aortic and coronary calcification on CT (data available in 3500 people), b) aortic plaque burden by MRI (n=2000), c) carotid intimal-medial thickness by ultrasound (n=3500), d) clinical atherosclerotic CVD (n=500), and e) the dynamic balance between arterial calcification and bone demineralization (n=3500).</p>
<p>2. To identify the biomarker signatures of metabolic risk factors related to cardiovascular risk: a) systolic and diastolic blood pressure (n=7000), b) body mass index (n=7000) and visceral adiposity by CT (n=3500), c) dyslipidemia (lipid levels, n=7000), and d) impaired fasting glucose, diabetes, and insulin resistance (glucose and insulin levels, n=7000).</p>
<p>3. To identify genomic convergence (convergence of signals from genetic variation and gene expression) with SABRe biomarker levels and clinical traits and diseases.</p>
<p><br />The SABRe CVD Initiative Project-3 will conduct gene expression profiling of WBC derived RNA to characterize the genomic signatures of atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome in 5000-7000 FHS participants (lab work to take place at NHLBI Core Microarray Lab).</p>
<p>This process uses the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays for the gene expression analysis.</p>
<p>Brand name determination is based on the following: The Affymetrix GeneChip&reg; is sold only through Affymetrix, or, in certain territories outside of the U.S., through an authorized distributor.</p>
<p>The system is covered by patents as listed below, and must be utilized in total to be effective.<br />&bull;Affymetrix high-density probe arrays offer information densities as high as 10 6 per cm 2 and as low as 50 per cm 2. This feature is unique to Affymetrix and covered by patents, USPN 5,445,934, 5,744,305 and others.<br />&bull;Affymetrix photolithography manufacturing technology enables consistent reproduction of array designs and reduces variation inherent in less sophisticated array manufacturing technologies. This feature is unique to Affymetrix and covered by patents USPN 5,424186 and 5,510,270 and others.<br />&bull;The GeneChip Probe Arrays contain a fixed volume reaction chamber, which provides for automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.

<SOLNBR>NIH-NHLBI-HB-11-01
<RESPDATE>101509
<CONTACT>Dawn C Rabunsky, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0355, Fax 301-480-3432, Email drabunsk@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>
THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THE RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE OF THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, WHICH IS 15 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.	

The Blood Diseases and Resources Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking potential sources to perform as the central laboratory for the program entitled Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study  III (REDS-III). The applicable NAICS code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees. It is anticipated that one award will be made in January 2011 for a period of seven years. 
The objectives of the REDS-III program are to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. 

NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center, one central laboratory, up to four domestic hubs, and up to 4 international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE CENTRAL LABORATORY ONLY
The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: 1) donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The goal of this highly structured, multi-center, donor-recipient epidemiology, laboratory, and clinical outcomes program is to advance public health by conducting critical research to improve transfusion practices and the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in the U.S. and in countries affected by the AIDS epidemic.  The program will include large survey, epidemiological and laboratory investigations. Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program. The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions which need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  It is expected that about one third of the studies conducted in the REDS-III Domestic program will address donor and/or donation safety and availability issues, and other blood banking questions; and that about two thirds of the investigations will address adult transfusion recipient safety concerns.  Most studies performed in the international setting, however, are expected to address blood banking concerns including donor and/or donation safety and availability issues although a small number of studies might address transfusion recipient safety concerns. Comprehensive databases including information on donors and their donations/components (required for the Domestic and International programs), and on adult patients considered for, or receiving a transfusion (required for the Domestic program only) will enable study investigators with the necessary scientific and analytical expertise to address in a timely fashion, important scientific issues in blood banking and transfusion medicine.
The domestic hubs and the international programs will be supported by a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support.  The domestic hubs and the international programs shall also be supported by a central laboratory, which will be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  
The Central Laboratory of the REDS-III Program shall be responsible for: 1) providing technical laboratory expertise and serving as an active participant in developing and prioritizing all REDS-III domestic and international research activities; 2) proposing, developing, and conducting laboratory-based research studies; 3) performing infectious disease, genetic, molecular, immunological, hematological or other processing and testing of biospecimens from all domestic hubs and international sites participating in RED-III epidemiological and laboratory studies according to protocol; 4) arranging and managing subcontracts with other laboratory testing facilities, as appropriate; and 5) serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), intends to compete its requirement for a Shoe Scanning Device (SSD) System. The SSD system will be capable of detecting threat objects concealed in footwear without requiring passengers to remove their footwear as they pass through a security checkpoint. These threat objects include a wide variety of military, commercial, and homemade explosives or explosives devices. Further background information regarding the SSD program is provided at the bottom of this announcement.
<p>The estimated release date for the solicitation is 25 April 2011. The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on this same FedBizOps webpage, with the exception of RFP attachments which are considered either Sensitive Security Information (SSI) or Classified National Security Information (CNSI), respectively. In order to be approved to view to these documents upon RFP release, a contractor must meet the requirements and complete the steps listed below prior to 04 April 2011. Non-compliance will not render a contractor ineligible to submit a proposal, however, SSI and/or CNSI cannot be provided otherwise.</p>
<p>SSI:<br />1. Provide the CAGE code of the Contractor's facility that will manage the proposal.<br />2. Designate a Senior Corporate Official, who is responsible for serving as the single point of contact for SSI and certifying to the Contracting Officer every 60 days that all appropriate protections have been followed, only authorized individuals have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals with access adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information.<br />3. Provide the following information for all individuals who need to view SSI; provide this information via email in one password protected Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and send the password in a separate email:<br />a. Contractor/Subcontractor name<br />b. Employee Full Name<br />c. Employee Gender<br />d. Employee Birth Date<br />e. Employee Citizenship<br />f. Employee Social Security Number <br />4. Provide a fully completed and witnessed non-disclosure agreement for all employees who need to view SSI. Use the attached form entitled "Non-Disclosure Agreement."<br />5. Contractors are limited to 35 individuals (inclusive of any subcontractors) who can have access to SSI.<br />6. Only one list of individuals may be submitted. No revisions will be permitted.</p>
<p>CNSI:<br />1. Contractors must have a facility clearance (FCL) at the Secret level and receive a DD-254 from the Government. <br />2. As applicable, contractors must provide information requested by the Government in order to complete any required DD-254, and must follow any instructions contained therein after issuance.<br />3. The Government will use the contractor's CAGE code (provided per the above SSI instructions) to determine the contractor's FCL status.</p>
<p>All information must be emailed to Minh-Ha.Do@dhs.gov and Lance.Nyman@dhs.gov.</p>
<p>The attached documents entitled "Synopsis - SSD - Further Pre-Solicitation SSI Information" and "Synopsis - SSD - Further CNSI Information" contain further information concerning SSI and CNSI, respectively.</p>
<p><br />SSD PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) currently requires that all passenger footwear be removed and scanned by X-ray machines as part of the checkpoint screening process. The removal of footwear takes time, reduces the efficiency of the checkpoint, creates safety concerns with footwear removal and contributes to passenger dissatisfaction. In addition, scanning footwear through the X-ray machine increases the volume of items that the Transportation Security Officers (TSO) at the X-ray machine must visually screen.</p>
<p>Currently 98% of passengers must remove their footwear for screening in the X-ray machine. The high-level goals of the SSD program include:<br />&bull; Achieving the current level of screening capabilities provided by the current Advanced Technology (AT)-2 X-ray machine baseline;<br />&bull; Reducing the number of passengers required to remove their footwear;<br />&bull; Performing screening without increasing TSO staffing levels. <br />&bull; Improve the TSA's ability to screen passengers by increasing probability of detection, expanding detection capability to the full threat list defined in the Classified Requirement Document and reducing the probability of a false alarm.<br />&bull; Increase overall operational throughput by reducing the system scanning time required to process an individual and design the system for ease of movement of passengers to allow for intuitive operation.<br />&bull; Improve reliability, availability, and maintainability by designing the system for quick access to perform preventative maintenance and unscheduled maintenance without needing to move the system. <br />&bull; Preclude the need for preventative maintenance at an unreasonable level (under seven days) or require custom tools to perform preventative maintenance.<br />&bull; Improve deployability of the system by accommodating adaptation to the varying environmental conditions in airports and storage facilities (e.g., temperature, humidity, altitude, etc.).</p>

<DESC>The Development, Operations, and Maintenance (DO&amp;M) requirement in support of the Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) for the 705th Combat Training Squadron (CTS) at Kirtland AFB, NM, is currently performed by Lockheed Martin Simulation, Training, and Support, 12506 Lake Underhill Rd, Orlando, FL 32825-5002, under contract F29601-01-C-0242. This contract was originally awarded October 2001. In order to ensure critical mission requirements continue upon this contract's expiration, 30 September 2011, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source 6 month follow-on (bridge) contract (4 month basic period with 2 one-month options) with the incumbent contractor, Lockheed Martin, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. This authority allows for a follow-on contract for highly specialized services when award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Due to the specialized nature of the services being performed, the number and level of security clearances required, and the multitude of on-going projects (30 projects) requiring continuity, if a follow-on contract award were to be made to other than the incumbent, there is a required 30-day transition period (starting 1 September 2011) to ensure proper project transition, with the successor contractor taking on full responsibility by 30 September 2011. Given the need for a 30-day transition period, this NOCA is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the DMOC needs as further described below. The sole purpose of the bridge contract is to ensure critical mission requirements continue while AFNWC/PKE completes a competitive source selection for the procurement of these DO&amp;M services. The Sources Sought for the competitive source selection was posted on 15 September 2010 through the Federal Business Opportunities website. The formal Request for Proposal for the competitive source selection was posted on 1 March 2011 as the Infrastructure, Development, and Engineering effort FA9422-11-R-0001.
<p>Description of the Efforts Needed Statement Of Work (SOW): <br />The mission of the 705 CTS is to "develop, integrate, and deliver a virtual Air, Space, and Cyber environment for Air Force, Joint, and Coalition combat training, test, and experimentation." This mission requires the 705 CTS to maintain a highly-qualified staff of government and contractor personnel with expertise in exercise design and execution, weapons systems integration and interoperability and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology development. Since the Air Force inherited Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities from the Identification Friend, Foe, or Neutral Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) in 1990, the mission and capabilities of the DMOC, have undergone significant change. One of the major drivers in this change was the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) endorsement of the DMO vision in 2004. DMO promotes the use of advanced M&amp;S capabilities as a realistic means to connect Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) assets and combat systems to test and train on modern tactics, particularly during times of high Operations Tempo (OPSTEMPO). Furthermore, training and testing transformation initiatives within the Department of Defense (DoD) will continue to have a major influence on the DMOC. Since 2005, the DMOC has experienced a significant growth in mission requirements and in staffing levels to achieve the DMO vision established by CSAF. The 705 CTS anticipates continued expansion of the DMOC mission primarily in the areas of seamlessly integrating the Theater Air Ground System (TAGS) at the operational and tactical levels of warfare, providing robust joint and coalition training, controlled interface and Multi National Information Sharing (MNIS) operations, testing in realistic operational environments, integrating live and simulation environments, and experimenting with advanced weapons systems and evolving Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>Utilizing the DMOC and associated resources, the 705 CTS performs training, tests, and experimentation with military personnel operating live weapon systems and high fidelity simulations in a dense synthetic environment. DMOC resources include: simulations of airborne systems; surveillance systems; airborne and ground command, control and communication systems; Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs); voice communications systems, data link systems; data loggers; network analysis tools; and intelligence systems. The battlespace is currently capable of simulating up to 50,000 simultaneous air and ground objects. Digital terrain databases include Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), Digital Feature Analysis Data (DFAD), and Controlled Image Base (CIB) imagery. Information Operations (IO), Electronic Warfare (EW) and Weather effects (Wx) are under development and may be modeled.</p>
<p>The DMOC is linked to a large number of military and contractor simulation facilities through point-to-point and wide area networks. Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High Level Architecture (HLA) and Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) gateways and corresponding network components allow the DMOC to interface with a variety of joint Live - Virtual - Constructive (LVC) simulation facilities. Translators are available to allow exchange of tactical data link messages between actual field equipment and simulation models.</p>
<p>Objective:<br />The offeror shall provide technical expertise for the DMOC battlespace to support execution of DMOC training events, tests, and experimentation activities as well as other DMOC appropriate initiatives such as design and implementation of DMO standards. The DMOC battlespace includes, but will not be limited to: internal and external networks and their connections; IT equipment; numerous desktop computers and servers; communication equipment; a variety of LVC simulators; a wide breadth of commercial, government and custom software applications and operating systems; and everyday office equipment. Contract deliverables will include, but will not be limited to: developing and implementing working hardware and software solutions; ensuring connectivity across multiple networks; programmatic deliverables; after action reports; technical reports; study reports; trip reports; engineering drawings; system, and technical architectures; simulation interoperability standards; and technical schematics.<br />Based on current trends the estimated labor total for this scope of work is 75,000 hours for the 6 month period.</p>

<DESC>OFADD: AFNIC/ENSE, 203 W. Losey St. RM 2000, Scott AFB IL 62225-5222<br />SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />POC: Robert Poulin, 618-229-5531, Computer Engineer<br />DESC: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis and market research. Information obtained as a result of this RFI is for planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for Sealed Bid or Requests for Proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government or the Government issuing a RFP at this time.
<p>Background: The Air Force is designing new network architectures for the years 2014 and beyond and is exploring a "Policy Based Management System (PBMS)." A PBMS would provide a consistent, enterprise-wide network behavior by distributing and enforcing policies across the enterprise network. In this context, a policy is a formal representation of the high-level management strategy for the network. Policies should control the following items but are not limited to this list:<br />1. Firewall rules<br />2. Routing rules<br />3. Security devices<br />4. End devices through the use of white or grey listing<br />5. Data Storage, retention, transportation and dissemination through the use of metadata tags and user roles<br />NOTE: The following only define capabilities and are not to be construed as a predefined solution. A PBMS could include but is not limited to 1) a policy management tool (PMT), 2) a policy repository (PR), 3) policy decision points (PDP), 4) policy enforcement points (or policy clients) (PEP), and 5) off-line analysis system (OAS).<br />The PMT is the enterprise front end interface which allows the central definition of policies. Normally, polices are created in informal, human language terms, and the PMT must translate those policies into a formal automated language. In addition, the PMT must ensure that policies created will not violate security properties of the of the enterprise network while dealing with or avoiding intractable problems inherent with such a system. If the system should receive a policy that violates the security properties of the enterprise network or the calculation of potential violations is intractable or cannot be conducted in near real time, the system must inform the user of the violation and seek consent before allowing them to proceed. Furthermore, if the calculation is intractable or cannot be conducted in near real time, the PMT should recommend off-line analysis by the OAS (capabilities explained later). Finally, the PMT must support and allow the implementation of predefined network security levels that can be invoked in minimal time to increase or decrease the security posture of the enterprise network.<br />The PR should maintain the complete list of all enforced policies both at the enterprise and at the local level. In addition, it should maintain a log of all network policy states for a predefined period of time. It should also maintain a list of predefined policies for implementation at any moment to achieve predefined security postures. Finally, the PR's database of policies currently enforced should be accessible by the OAS for calculations.<br />The PDP will interface with the PMT and the PEP. PDPs need to enforce polices passed by the PMT and must report compliance or lack of compliance from the PEPs back to the PMT. In addition, the PDP should ensure that any policies from the PMT do not reduce the security properties of the PEPs, to include local security properties under their control and must report any conflicts back to the PMT. <br />The PEP will interface with PDPs and report and enforce current policies. In addition, PEPs will ensure that PMT policies that increase the security posture of the local network override all local policies that conflict and report any conflicts to the PDP. PEPs can include but are not limited to firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, routers, anti-virus systems and host based intrusion systems. <br />The OAS will have the ability to download the current security properties of the network to include local security properties of the enterprise network from the PR for analysis. The OAS will allow the testing of more complicated policies that are beyond the capability of the PMT to conduct near real time analysis. The OAS will still have the ability to identify policy decisions that result in intractable calculations before beginning detailed analysis. <br />Some of the required properties of the PBMS include but are not limited to the following:<br />1. Handle exceptions to policy for portions of the network.<br />2. Identify denial of critical and non-critical services.<br />3. Work in a multi-vendor network environment (Routers, firewalls, etc.).<br />4. Communicate securely with PDPs and PEPs ensure proper authentication.</p>

Please E-Mail your information to:   reuben.b.orris@us.army..mil or FAX to 309-782-6727 or 309-782-3721. <br>TITANIUM SLURRY <br>Primary/Facecoat Slurry:<br>-	The Contractor will provide a primary/facecoat system for use in Investment Casting shells for cast titanium.  This primary/facecoat will be the first layer applied to the wax pattern and therefore, be immediately contacting the cast titanium.  <br>-	The recommended primary/facecoat will be a commercially proven system that is compatible with the casting of titanium alloys.  <br>-	The recommended primary/facecoat will be a non-Ethyl Silicate blend which does not require special ventilation or additional flame supression.  <br>-	The primary/facecoat system will be ammonia FREE.<br>-	The recommended primary/facecoat must be formulated to minimize alpha case to levels which are typical for the titanium commercial industry.   <br>-	Cost must be a factor in selecting the recommended primary/facecoat since the majority of the titanium applications to be produced at RIA-JMTC will be non-aerospace lower cost components. <br>-	Currently RIA-JMTC uses The Kindt-Collins wax system so the recommended titanium primary/facecoat must be compatible with the existing The Kindt-Collins wax system.  If that is not possible the Contractor shall recommend several commercially available wax compositions that are compatible with the recommended primary/facecoat.  <br>-	The Contractor will provide all ingredients and the recipe to produce a primary/facecoat slurry including but not limited to:<br>o	Flour<br>o	Binder<br>o	Wetting agent<br>o	Anti-foam<br>o	Anti-bacteria<br>-	The Contractor will provide work instructions for blending and soak time for the primary/facecoat slurry and additives.<br>-	The Contractor will provide all limits for quality on the primary/facecoat slurry along with guidelines on how to keep the slurry viable.<br>-	The Contractor will also recommend test equipment for doing the quality checks.<br>-	The Contractor will also provide an estimate as to slurry pot life for cost estimating purposes<br>Secondary/Intermediate Slurry and/or Final/Backup Slurry:<br>Please provide option 1 ,2 or 3-<br>-	1.  RIA-JMTC currently uses a final/backup slurry system for their aluminum and steel casting investment molds which is Colloidal Silica.    The preference would be that the primary/facecoat system is compatible with our existing backup system such that RIA-JMTC can use one final/backup system for all of its investment cast products.  <br>-	2.   IF the primary/ facecoat  shell layers used for titanium casting will be incompatible with the  existing RIA-JMTC secondary/ final slurry, then the Contractor will provide a secondary/intermediate system for use in Investment Casting shells.  This secondary/intermediate will adhere to both the primary/facecoat slurry and the current backup slurry coats providing the needed barrier between the primary and final coats. <br>-	3.   IF the primary/ facecoat  shell layers used for titanium casting will be incompatible with the  existing RIA-JMTC secondary/ final slurry, then the Contractor will provide a secondary/final system for use in Investment Casting shells eliminating a 3rd slurry.<br>-	The recommended final/backup slurry system or secondary/intermediate system will be a commercially proven system that is compatible with the casting of titanium alloys. <br>-	The recommended final/backup slurry system or secondary/intermediate will be ammonia free and require no special ventilation.<br>-	The Contractor will provide all ingredients, and the recipe to produce a secondary/intermediate slurry including but not limited to:<br>o	Flour<br>o	Binder<br>o	Wetting agent<br>o	Anti-foam<br>o	Anti-bacteria<br>-	The Contractor will provide work instructions for blending and soak time for the secondary slurry and additives.<br>-	The Contractor will provide all limits for quality on the secondary slurry along with guidelines on how to keep the slurry viable.<br>-	The Contractor will also recommend test equipment for doing the quality checks.<br>-	The Contractor will also provide an estimate as to slurry pot life for cost estimating purposes.  <br><br><br>

<CONTACT>Constance B Hampton
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award of a contact to Walker Research Group LTD to conduct an ethnographic study in order to identify properties of historic, traditional, contemporary, and ongoing religious and cultural significance and importance in the study area of southeastern Oregon.  The Idaho Power Company has applied for a right-of-way grant for the Boardman to Hemingway 500 kV transmission line across Bureau of Land Management/Forest Service/Bureau of Reclamation (hereafter referred to as Federal Agencies) administered public lands.  Federal Agencies are mandated to consult with tribal governments whose interests might be directly and substantially affected by activities on federally administered lands.  The purpose of this study is to document Shoshone-Paiute use and reliance on the natural and cultural resources in the project area across southeastern Oregon.  Data review will include interviews with knowledgeable tribal elders to locate and identify properties of potential traditional cultural and religious significance in the study area.  It is believed that the Walker Research Group is the only entity with access to Shoshone-Paiute elders and records necessary to the study.  A final report will:
	Include maps (where approved by the Tribes), 	A bibliography of the literature reviewed, 	A thorough discussion of the methods used in the study,	A summary of major findings,	And identify to the extent permitted by the Tribes, resources and properties of traditional religious and cultural importance by the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. This information will be used in the development of the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Boardman to Hemingway 500kV powerline project. 
This acquisition is pursuant to 41 USC 253(c), Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition.  The applicable NAICS code is 541720.  All parties who possess the skills and access to the required tribal information may submit their qualifications statement evidencing such to the BLM, referencing L11PS00296 via email to or952mb@blm.gov or facsimile at 503-808-6312 by 4:15 pm, March 30, 2011, local time (PST).  This is NOT a Request for Quotation; the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><strong>This is a Sources Sought&nbsp;for 8a, Woman Owned Small Business&nbsp;and Small Disadvantaged Veterans Owned Business only.<br /><br /></strong>Please respond with your corporate capabilities and any other relevant information that would allow USDA to determine your ability to perform the following type of requirement.<br /><br />1 BACKGROUND
<p>The mission of the USDA Satellite Imagery Archive (SIA) is to make satellite imagery available to USDA subscriber agencies in a timely and economical fashion during the US crop growing season. Key performance indicators are measured by timely distribution and receipt of requested satellite imagery during the crop season, and providing bulk satellite imagery during the crop season at a measurable economic benefit to the USDA subscribing agencies.</p>
<p>The USDA's Remote Sensing Coordinating Committee (RSCC) recommended the formation of the SIA, which evolved from annual imagery purchased by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) from approximately 1985-2000. The SIA was officially established in March, 2000 by a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Foreign Agricultural Service, Farm Service Agency, Forest Service (FS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The National Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), the Risk Management Agency (RMA) and the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) later became SIA subscribers. The members of the RSCC include the above USDA subscribing agencies and the RSCC meets quarterly to review SIA activities, as well as exchange satellite imagery information between the USDA subscribing members.</p>
<p>The SIA facility is managed and operated by the SIA Manager, with the assistance of one contractor (the Archive Assistant). The SIA Manager reports quarterly to the USDA's RSCC pertaining to imagery request fulfillments and he/she is responsible for the purchase, receipt, inventory, storage, and dissemination of satellite imagery to USDA agency subscribers, as well as the physical management of the SIA facility and the online Archive Explorer (AE) system at http://www.pecad.fas.usda.gov/archive_explorer/default.cfm. The SIA facility and AE system is located in the USDA South Building in Washington DC and it is managed by the International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), Office of Global Analysis (OGA).</p>
<p>All satellite imagery for the current SOW will be delivered by the satellite vendor to the USDA's SIA, and the imagery later distributed to subscribing USDA agency members through the AE system.</p>
<p>2 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective is to acquire moderate resolution satellite imagery to monitor the United States upcoming&nbsp;crop season.</p>
<p><br />3 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Scope of Work is to deliver moderate satellite imagery within the lower 48 states of the United States to USDA's SIA and according to the requirements specified below.<br /><br /><br />a. Pixel Resolution: The horizontal ground resolution or ground sample distance (the area of the ground represented in each pixel in x and y components) of the multispectral imagery shall be no less than 20-meters and no greater than 60-meters.&nbsp;<br /><br />b. Geo-referencing: Orthorectification within 72 hours of image acquisition to a CE90 (Circular Error of 90%) or within one pixel of image ground sample distance is desired.</p>
<p>c. Band Combination: A minimum of four bands of multispectral imagery are required, consisting of two visible bands, one near infrared band and one short-wave infrared band (SWIR) is preferred.</p>
<p>d. Resampling method: Cubic Convolution</p>
<p>e. Cloud Cover: Imagery with 30% or less cloud cover is required.</p>
<p>f. Swath Width: Satellite imagery with swath width equal to or greater than 185-kilometers is required. Satellite imagery with swath widths less than 185-kilometers will not be considered. Larger swath width greater than 185-km is preferred.</p>
<p>g. Temporal Resolution or Overpass Frequency: The frequency of satellite-image collection should result in at least two scenes per month of 30% or less cloud-free imagery over the cropland pixels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>h. Cloud Coverage over Cropland Pixels: Due to constraints caused by clouds that can appear in any portion of the scene when a satellite is overhead, FAS/IPAD will accept all satellite images that are more than 30% cloud cover for the entire image but cloud cover is less than 30% over the cropland pixels within the image. A predefined crop mask that is accepted by FAS/IPAD can be used by the vendor to define "cropland pixels" and for determining if less than 30% of the cropland pixels are covered by clouds.</p>

This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of providing Professional Services in support of a Cleft Lip Palate study for Syrian Arab Republic families.

The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ). 

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBIs use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.

The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZONE) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 621111 with a size standard of $10.0M Per Annum. 

Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services within 30 days after receipt of purchase order. 

This contract covers work to be performed as part of a continued collaborative effort under protocol OH97-HG-N035 (most recently approved by the NHGRI Institutional Review Board on June 23, 2010). The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH is conducting a study of the inherited susceptibility to oral clefts, with emphasis on non-syndromic oral clefts. The objective of the study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis, association analysis and gene mapping strategies.  Characterization of genes involved in causing inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance and pathogenesis of this disease. As such, clinical data, family history data and blood samples from individuals in large families with multiple individuals affected with oral clefts is needed. Large families with multiple living affected family members are rare in the United States, given todays small average sibship size, and thus it is important to obtain data on such families from countries where such families are more common. In the Syrian Arab Republic, family sizes are large and intergeneration times are much shorter than in the U.S. 

These services are needed since it would not be feasible, either logistically or financially, to bring the members of the participating families to the U.S to be seen at the NIH and investigators at the NIH have no way to identify families with multiple affected individuals who reside in the Syrian Arab Republic. A contract with a local clinician who has proven that he can enroll suitable families is the most efficient and most economical way to conduct this study.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The purpose of this procurement is to provide professional services to the researchers dedicated to the study.  These services will be in the areas of: determination of eligibility, patient registration, clinical evaluation of family members, biological sample collection and shipment, recontact of previously studied family members as needed by the NIH scientists to update information or consents and to explain clinically relevant results if needed.

The K&amp;L Microwave Band Pass Filter P/N 4C40-410.5/T1-BP/B is specifically made to operate with the National Weather Service (NWS) Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) Narrowband Frequencies of 410.075 and 410.950MHz. The filters band pass characteristics are compatible with the ASOS communications between the ASOS Acquisition Control Unit and the Data Collection Platform. The use of another manufacturer's band pass jeopardize the communications associated with ASOS by causing Radio Interference into Federal Aviation Administration communications systems located on or near airports, typically where the ASOS is installed and operating. The use of another manufacturer's band pass filter would require extensive field testing at the Government's expense whose costs could not be recovered by the difference in competitive pricing versus sole source. The Government does not have the design rights of the manufacturer drawings for this part. Therefore, it is recommended to purchase the item by part number. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO.

The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide technical and analytical support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) and other divisions within OTAQ. 
ASD has the primary responsibility for developing mobile source emissions models and inventories and developing and promulgating mobile source air emission standards under Title II of the Clean Air Act Amendments of November 15, 1990 (CAAA). Studying, modeling, and regulating Greenhouse Gas emissions from mobile sources, as well as studying new engine technologies and fuels to reduce these emissions, has become a major area of focus for ASD, which also works with other divisions in OTAQ on these issues.
Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages submitted by respondents are as follows: (1) Capabilities to provide economic, environmental, statistical, scientific, and evaluative analysis support, (2) Capabilities to provide technical and engineering analysis support, (3) Capabilities to provide Graphical Information Systems (GIS), training, peer review, literature review and analysis, information collection request (ICR) and database development support, and (4) Capabilities to provide communication, outreach, meeting and public hearing, docketing, response to public comments, guidance, training, and regulatory program support.
The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS). A draft PWS can be obtained for the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. 
Any interested firms should submit capability statement with information that clearly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the services described above, including personnel, experience, and qualifications. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.
It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) with five one-year periods, each with LOE of approximately 26,000 hours. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services) with a small business size standard of $7 million. In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small-disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern. 
As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. These capability statements are merely and aid to the EPAs market research efforts. Respondents are advised that EPA is under no obligation to provide respondents with any feedback on the information received. 
Responses to the above should be submitted to Lisa Ryle, U.S. EPA, Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268 no later than July 19, 2010.

<DESC>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Assured SATCOM Services In Single Theater (ASSIST)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Request for Information<br /></strong><br /><br /><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency, Procurement and Logistics,<br />DITCO-Scott, 2300 East Drive Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406 <br />
<p><strong><br />Purpose:</strong> The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information regarding an end-to-end Ka- and Ku- commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) capability for Department of Defense theater specific operations.&nbsp; This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment for an RFP in the future.&nbsp; This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.&nbsp; Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> COMSATCOM is an essential communications component for in-theater operations.&nbsp; The USCENTCOM theater of operations incurs the greatest amount of COMSATCOM usage, using Ku-band service on more than 20 different commercial communications satellites, mostly through the use of base period leases (typically single-year) with additional option year leases.&nbsp; Leases range from small fractions of a Transponded Equivalent (TPE) to multiple TPEs with an aggregate sustained demand of over 5 GHz of service and more than 1,200 terminal links/accesses.</p>
<p>With the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 President's Budget Request, the DoD is preparing for an FY12-FY14 investment to acquire long-term satellite communications services in the Ka- and Ku-bands, preferably on a single satellite, to meet COCOM theater demand, directing as many future users and migrating as many existing users as possible from Ku to Ka-band.&nbsp; (Per Appendix A, Ground Tactical demand is envisioned migrating to Ka-band whereas AISR Demand will remain at Ku-band.)&nbsp; The investment includes both the space segment and associated terminals.&nbsp; Initially, the DoD goal is to reduce costs for COMSATCOM capability in the CENTCOM theater of operations.&nbsp; In the future, DoD requires the flexibility of moving these services to other theaters of operation as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options including possible use of the General Services Administration (GSA) Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132-54, Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity, which was established as part of the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) to acquire the space segment service.&nbsp; DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options for acquiring, or modifying terminals and other necessary user equipment including possible use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-3, 132-4, 132-8, and/or 132-9; the new GSA Custom SATCOM Solutions (CS2) and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts scheduled to be available by 4th Quarter FY2011; or another existing DoD contract focused on terminals and user equipment.</p>
<p><strong>[Note that Schedule 70 has an open enrollment provision, allowing interested vendors to apply at any time.&nbsp; The timeline to receive a Schedule 70 contract is typically four (4) months from submission of a complete proposal.&nbsp; Please see www.gsa.gov/schedule70 and www.gsa.gov/fcsa for further details.]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The budgeted cost for the service is $440 million to include service operations and initial terminal modifications and replacements to use the space segment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is seeking the following capabilities from this COMSATCOM service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Primary services supported at Ka frequencies (20.2-21.2 GHz on the downlink, 30.0-31.0 GHz on the uplink). The DoD will consider all industry solutions for securing orbital and frequency authorization and will assist with any approach deemed feasible based upon US domestic and international regulatory requirements. Industry would be solely responsible for obtaining licensing and orbital allocation using their normal process.<br /><br />-At least enough space resources to meet the current commercial SATCOM demand described in Appendix A. The objective is double demand documented in Appendix A with theater area beams.</p>
<p>-Service is available for use starting no later than 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>-Ability to support multiple changes to the theater of operation for the service over the lifetime of the lease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix A contains a summary of the current commercial SATCOM demand characteristics that make up the current Ku-band leases (Scenario #1). In addition, data is also provided about the currently deployed in-theater terminal population accessing these COMSATCOM services. An alternative scenario (Scenario #2) is also described to assess system extensibility.</p>
<p>Information Requested: The following questions are intended to help structure the acquisition of the stated COMSATCOM capability, including space segment service and terminals. Questions are intended to enable DoD to refine its strategy for this commercial SATCOM capability.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical<br />T1.</strong>What Ka-band and Ku-band services do you already have planned (or could provide) by the service start date? What is the design and on-orbit pedigree of the capability? What is the expected design and operating life?<br /><strong>T2.</strong>Assuming that the services you provide are initially to support the user population in Appendix A, Scenario 1, but later the services must be moved to another theater to support the user population shown in Appendix A, Scenario 2, what percentage of each Scenario's requirements do you estimate could be met with such a system or service? <br /><strong>T3.</strong>Describe the coverage, polarization, and bandwidth assignments of your proposed solution. Can the 30.0-31.0 GHz up / 20.2-21.2 GHz down gateway links be steerable? If so, how many can be supported? <br /><strong>T4.</strong>To what extent can some or all of the theatre Ka- and Ku-band coverages be steered to facilitate optimized service after repositioning? Can that Ka-band coverage be segmented and steered independently? <br /><strong>T5.</strong>What are the satellite station keeping requirements to achieve the forecasted performance of your solution?<br /><strong>T6.</strong>What terrestrial infrastructure (terminals, gateways, DoD gateways, network operations center (NOCs), hubs, terrestrial connectivity) is required to deliver your projected performance? Please include details on number of gateways required, number of terminals, connectivity, topology, terminal technical characteristics, polarization, use of multiple frequency bands to terminate user links, etc.)? Specify any assumptions you make.<br /><strong>T7.</strong>Describe the interoperability of your service with planned DoD military Ka-band systems (e.g., terminals that meet MIL-STD-188-164 and modems that meet MIL-STD-188-165.) To what extent would the performance discussed in T1 change if you were to rely exclusively on planned DoD Ka-band terminals and the planned modem inventory? (The WGS terminal population predominantly operates RHCP on the uplink and LHCP on the downlink with an axial ratio of &lt; 2dB. Select coverage areas on the WGS satellite are also capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, non-simultaneously. Select DoD Ka-band terminal types are capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, again, non-simultaneously.)<br /><strong>T8.</strong>Describe the major components of the system and service (e.g., satellite, gateways, terminals, modems, hubs, NOCs)? Describe the assumptions and function of each component and the extent to which forecasted performance is dependent on each component's characteristics to achieve the system performance forecast. <br /><strong>T9.</strong>Using the information in Appendix A, specify any user equipment changes needed. Include the estimated number of terminals that will need to be replaced. For new and replacement terminals, provide size, weight, and power demands of the equipment and any ruggedized characteristics of the equipment. To what extent does the performance of your solution require homogeneous terminal sizes/performance? What are the practical limits on diverse terminal sizes on your solution? To what extend is the performance of your solution dependent upon a specified connectivity type (e.g., hub-spoke only)? What is the impact to the performance if the service must support hub-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh connectivity.<br /><strong>T10.</strong>What terminals, modems, and network equipment are available that provide end-to-end service for your solution? From what sources can this equipment and terminals be procured?<br /><strong>T11.</strong>Describe the operations and control plan for your service including the location of the control facilities. Describe the process for a user to request and obtain service. Describe the security features that could be made available from that control facility. What tools would be necessary for the Government to provide payload configuration direction? Are those tools included in your solution and price estimates? Describe the functions and staffing of any NOC used for operations of comparable commercial systems.<br /><strong>T12.</strong>What are the information assurance features or characteristics of your service (e.g., TT&amp;C link encryption, network controls)? How compliant is it with the MAC I IA controls specified for GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54? (See Appendix B).<br /><strong>T13.</strong>Is your service capable of meeting the "Terms and Conditions Applicable to <br />Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity (Special Item Number 132-54)"? (See 08_Proposal Price List Preparation document within Schedule 70 solicitation - http://www.gsa.gov/schedule70.) <br /><strong>T14.</strong>Describe your plan, including any steps requiring DoD activity, for gaining orbital slot approval for the space segment. What are the regulatory considerations and what is their impact on schedule? Cost considerations?</p>
<p><strong>Funding/ Contracting Mechanisms<br />F1.</strong>Provide a ROM total cost and the percentage for each cost element for your proposed solution.<br /><strong>F2.</strong>What are your standard payment practices for your proposed service? Are there specific payment models that you would recommend? Are there constraints should payment not occur until service delivery?<br /><strong>F3.</strong>What are your standard service agreements for leases of this duration? What arrangements do you enter into with commercial customers to provide them the assurance that you will deliver the service over the entire lease assuming full payment occurs no later than 2018?<br /><strong>F4.</strong>Assuming the last increment of funding is dispersed after successful service activation and the contractor will provide satellite operations for a period beyond that date, how does the Government ensure its service level agreement over that period between last payment and service end date is met (e.g., a liquidated damages clause (i.e., Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.211-11))? If so, what would be the possible terms and structure of such a liquidated damages clause?<br /><strong>F5.</strong>The Government is exploring the use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 for acquiring space segment services. For the associated terminals, please describe your preferred contracting mechanism - GSA IT Schedule 70, or the CS2 and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts, or another existing DoD contract - for terminal leasing, procurement or modification and installation. From what other contracts or sources can these terminals be procured?<br /><br /><strong>Schedule<br />S1.</strong>The desired date from service activation is 31 December 2014; describe your plan to meet this schedule. What is the necessary contract award date to accomplish this? Ensure service test and checkout prior to Government acceptance of the service is included in your schedule.<br /><strong>S2.</strong>Describe the timeline for terminal and user equipment contract award to delivery and installation of equipment.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Market Research for Use of Project Labor Agreements for Large Scale Military Construction FY12 Projects, Various Locations, Alaska</strong></p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers, Alaska District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale military construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the State of Alaska to include Fort Wainwright, Fort Greely, Eielson Air Force Base, and Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson (JBER). A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br /><br />(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br /><br />(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br />(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br />(2) Be consistent with the law. Reference: Provision 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br /><br /><strong>Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions: <br /><br /></strong>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar, large scale military construction contracts at Fort Greely, Fort Wainwright, Eielson Air Force Base and/or Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson (JBER)? If yes, describe how a PLA will achieve economy and efficiency in the procurement, produce labor-management stability, and/or ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards? If no, describe why?<br /><br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br /><br />(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? How?<br /><br />(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br /><br />(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br /><br />(6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA?<br /><br />(7) What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Alaska District Engineer contract?<br /><br />Please limit your responses to no more than two (2) to three (3) pages in length. Please provide your comments via email to Kimberly Tripp, Contract Specialist, at Kimberly.Tripp@usace.army.mil, no later than 18 April 2011.</p>

Request for Information (RFI) VA101-11-RI-0055, VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Program

Background
The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing its first national Pharmacy Benefits Management Program for Workers' Compensation. This program is supported in principle by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, (OWCP) and builds on a pilot project based upon an Inter Agency Agreement with the United States Postal Service (USPS) implementing the program on a trial basis. This contract is intended to replace the IAA and contract for direct VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Services for its workers' compensation program.  

Objective
VA is seeking a national Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) organization, specializing in Federal workers' compensation, to administer the program. This will be a national program for VA employees who are injured on the job and require prescription medication and durable medical equipment paid from the OWCP Employee Compensation Fund which is then reimbursed by VA through the OWCP annual Chargeback process. Approximately 16,000 employees currently receive prescription medications monthly. These prescriptions result in approximately 88,000 prescription-related medical bills paid annually. The use of a PBM system will be a voluntary program where employees will have the option of using the approved PBM providers or choosing their own pharmacy provider. 

Eligibility
Two groups of VA employees will be eligible for coverage under this program. 

1. Group 1 is comprised of those who have an existing claim under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA). These employees have fully adjudicated workers' compensation claims and have coverage for all prescriptions that meet the OWCP formulary requirements for their accepted injury. 

2. Group 2 is comprised of new FECA claimants. These employees are newly injured on the job and have filed FECA claims pending adjudication by OWCP.

VA requests that the PBM provide a system for first fill prescription coverage for employees who sustain a traumatic injury at work. The PBM will provide a pharmacy card system to these employees as part of the VA injury packet. Full prescriptions coverage will be provided to all injured employees upon filing a FECA claim for traumatic injury.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: EMTEC Federal, Chantilly, VA  20151.  <br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <br><br>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: FAR 13.106-b(1)<br><br>(b) Soliciting from a single source. <br>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). <br><br>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: Laptop computer.<br><br><br>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  The contractor identified in the provided quote is the only source from the CHESS site that offers this product.<br><br><br>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: CHESS has completed market research and competed the item and price in accordance with the best business practice.<br><br><br>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>Laptop history at PM-FPS:<br><br>In June 2004, this office purchased 12 new laptop PCs to support our ICIDS road warriors (Site Mangers and Lead Project Officer spending up to 60% of duty in TDY status).  Since the office was unable to identify a single<br>solution to satisfy all users, two products were selected, and half were bought as Panasonic Toughbook laptops, and the other half were Dell Latitude laptops.  The Panasonic Toughbooks were slightly higher in price, but had<br>been touted as the ideal solution for the frequent traveler.  Both had comparable performance specifications.  <br><br>Of the laptops purchased, there have been many performance issues and failures among the Dell laptop laptops, to include total video failure, multiple hard disk failures, keyboard failures, and case breakage. Most are<br>now inoperable and have been turned in.  Among the Panasonic Toughbook laptops, there have been two failures. The first failure occurred in the first three months of operation (one line of pixels failed on video display). This was deemed an infant mortality issue by the manufacturer and immediately resolved. The other failure was a degradation of hard disk<br>performance after more than four years of extensive use and travel. The hard disk was replaced before any catastrophic loss of data, in part due to the early warning of pending disk errors. All of the Toughbook laptops purchased are still providing reliable service, after 5 years of extensive use and travel.<br><br>In 2007 an additional 18 new Dell Latitude laptops were purchased for PM-FPS. This time, the buy was for a Dell's ruggedized Latitude ATG laptop. Of these laptops purchased, almost 90% have failed, requiring service with<br>several having catastrophic hard drive failures with little-to-no warning of an impending failure, and subsequent loss of critical program data. <br><br>Our personnel have to brief our customers at the O-6 or equivalent and beyond at the customer site. Often, there are last minute changes to the briefings based on findings at the site after we arrive and discover new issues. Showing up with inoperable equipment is not only professionally embarrassing, it is unproductive and makes this office appear<br>unprofessional. Time lost having a laptop sent out for repair, and subsequent data accessibility issues waste Government resources and impacts our ability to perform.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island is alerting interested offerors that a new Purchase Description is available for the next M700 Time Blasting Fuse procurement.  ACC-RI intends to issue a Request for Proposal in June 2011 for a base quantity of 1.5 Million feet of M700 Fuse, with a 200% evaluated option provision.  A previous full & open competitive Request for Proposal W52P1J-10-R-0053 closed on April 6, 2010, with no proposals received by the Government for the solicited item.  The previous RFP included a Technical Data Package with a Detailed Specification MIL-DTL-45144E for the item:<br><br>DODIC: M670, NSN: 1375-00-028-5246, Fuse, Blasting Time: M700.<br><br>This fuse is used in military demolitions to ignite nonelectric blasting caps.  The burning rate of the fuse permits the operator to ignite the fuse and reach cover before detonation.  The fuse is similar to and interchangeable with standard safety fuse.  The fuse consists of a continuous delay of black powder, tightly wrapped and enclosed by an inner cover of jute yarn counterwound with cotton yarn, and covered by a thin cover of bitumen which in turn is covered on the outside by an extruded plastic sheath.  The fuse is olive drab with a yellow single band inches wide every 18 inches and a double yellow band every 90 inches.  The burning rate is 36 to 44 seconds per foot.<br><br>The Government conducted further market research related to the previous RFP in 2010 and has now replaced the MIL-DTL-45144E with a performance based Purchase Description for the M700 Time Blasting Fuse, AR-PD-171, dated Mar 2011.  <br><br>The M700 Purchase Description is Distribution Statement C, which means distribution is authorized to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors.  Interested parties that would like to obtain a copy of the Purchase Description must submit a written request to:  US Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, CCRC-AM, Ms. Alejandra Figueroa, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL, 61299-8000.   The written request should include the company's cage code and Joint Certification Number (JCP), if applicable (see http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/).  Interested parties will also be required to execute and return a Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement prior to obtaining the M700 Technical Data.

be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. I also recognize that VA may impose sanctions, up to and including termination of contract for violation of applicable confidentiality and security statutes, regulations and policies.

<DESC>Q. How many candidates will be tested in a given year?  The RFQ mentions that a summary report will be required on all candidates. What is required in the report?  Will the psychologist be required to make a "Pass/Fail" type recommendation or will it be a ranking of candidates.
A. Test numbers per year can range from 2 - 10, and likely average 5 tests for Region 6 per year. The summary report generally contains a paragraph on the "summary of the tests provided",  followed by 7 short paragraphs summarizing the following:  1.  Candor and honesty, 2.  Ability to compete the academy and be trained,  3.  Work Ethic,   4.  Social skills and social interest,  5. Hostilely and anger control,  6 Antisocial attitudes and behaviors, 7 Acting out behavior and safety risk. Each of the 7 categories is followed by a statement by the Doctor stating his opinion:  This candidate is a "Low", "Mild", or "High" risk in this area. The psychologist will not be required to rank candidates.
Q. I would need to be reassured that anything I summarized (as per Item #2 on statement of work) comprise less than 1/3 of the hiring decision input to comply with EEOC guidelines. Also, what is the protection for a consultant if an applicant challenges the summary.
A. The US Fish and Wildlife Service uses 11 functional areas of evaluation for each Law Enforcement Officer candidate.   In fact, the condition of employment letter states that the officer must successfully complete all 11 areas to complete the training regimen.   Pre-employment screening is one of the 11 evaluated criteria used for Officers.  Therefore, it is less than 1/3 of the hiring decision. I do not know the protection for an consultant in the event that an applicant challenges the summary. Ii has never happened.
Q. 1. There are professional guidelines in this field: http://theiacp.org/psych_services_section/pdfs/Psych-PreemploymentPsychEval.pdf  2.  To do an effective and professional evaluation, a face to face interview by a licensed psychologist is required;
A. Iit is not currently required by the Department Manual for Refuge Officers in the US Fish and Wildlife Service.   See attached Departmental manual (below).  The manual states that we must conduct a psychological screening.  Nationally, all regions of the USFWS are currently using the specifications I provided in the Scope of Work, and my preference is to maintain consistency across the country, and maintain the standards proposed in the scope of work. Face to face interviews are common in many law enforcement agency evaluations.  Again, currently we are not doing this.
Department of the InteriorDepartmental Manual  Effective Date: 10/4/00Series: Law Enforcement and SecurityPart 446: Law EnforcementChapter 2: Personnel Qualifications and StandardsOriginating Office: Office of Managing Risk and Public Safety  446 DM 22.1 Purpose. This chapter establishes the standards, qualifications and procedures for selection, training, performance evaluation, conduct and discipline of its law enforcement personnel.2.2 Selection. It is essential that the selection process utilized throughout the Department of the Interior (Department) be standardized to assure high professional law enforcement standards. Only applicants possessing adequate education and/or experience, aptitude and high moral character shall be employed as law enforcement officers. A. The Office of Managing Risk and Public Safety (MRPS), in conjunction with the Departmental Office of Personnel and the bureaus/offices involved, shall ensure that minimum acceptable standards and skill levels for all law enforcement personnel are instituted. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) approved qualification standards for series GS-1811, GS-1812 and GS-083 will be used as a primary basis in developing Departmental standards for all law enforcement officer positions. As appropriate, bureaus/offices are responsible for establishing necessary supplementary standards to comply with laws, regulations and the specific bureau/office mission objectives.B. Qualification standards for guards shall be used only for those persons hired exclusively to perform guard duties.C. The following medical, physical and psychological requirements shall be applicable:(1) Medical standards for all law enforcement positions shall be in compliance with Federal regulations and shall be established by all bureaus/offices. They will be reviewed and approved by the Federal Medical Officer, through coordination with the Office of the Secretary. Bureaus/offices will require all law enforcement officers under 40 years of age to complete a medical examination biennially. All law enforcement officers 40 years of age and older will complete a medical examination annually.(2) Applicants shall be physically able to perform efficiently the rigorous duties required of a law enforcement officer position. Prior to appointment to a law enforcement position bureaus/offices will require entry level applicants to pass a medical examination, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) Physical Efficiency Battery (PEB), and a psychological screen. These procedures will ensure that law enforcement officers are capable of performing strenuous physical training and law enforcement duties. Applicants shall be disqualified for appointment if they fail to meet any physical requirements or fail to obtain final medical clearance.(3) Bureaus/offices with law enforcement authority will utilize the FLETC PEB to establish minimum physical performance standards. All law enforcement officers will be required to participate in physical training (conditioning). All law enforcement officers will be required to participate in the PEB or an approved wellness program annually. Law enforcement officers assigned to positions deemed by the bureau/office to be sufficiently demanding will be required to meet FLETC minimum scores on the PEB. However, bureaus/offices may require that all law enforcement officers pass the PEB.D. Applicants who qualify in any required written examination and meet the education and/or experience, medical and physical requirements for law enforcement positions shall be personally interviewed. The number of applicants interviewed will be based upon the number of law enforcement positions to be filled. The Law Enforcement Administrator of each bureau/office will designate qualified law enforcement officials to conduct these interviews.E. Entrance and grade levels for the Department of the Interior law enforcement officers shall be comparable to similar positions and duties in other Federal law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement personnel who work longer than their standard shift shall be compensated as appropriate. Each bureau/office shall, as appropriate, develop law enforcement career ladders to meet its needs.

Travel costs for to ASMR attend the conferences are within the scope of the GSA Schedule Contract and will be in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit quotes by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 16, 2011 to Nancy Williams at Nancy.Williams@aqd.nbc.gov and Sarah Dolen at sarah.dolen@aqd.nbc.gov.

The VA intends to award a limited-source task order modification to Edge Systems, LLC for disaster recovery hardware installation and reconfiguration of the IMEDGE software for The Image Management System (TIMS).  POC for this requirement is Angela Deren 512-981-4432, e-mail Angela.Deren@va.gov 


JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL DOCMENT
 FOR A LIMITED SOURCE AWARD UNDER A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE 

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs
     			      Center of Acquisition Innovation 
     			      1701 Directors Blvd. Suite 600
     			      Austin, TX  78744

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a modification to Firm-Fixed-Price, Task Order (TO) number V0010A116E95270, issued under General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 70, General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services, Contract Number GS-35F-0250J, with Edge Systems, LLC (Edge Systems) to expand the scope of the TO to include additional Information Technology services associated with the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) The Image Management System (TIMS) software application. 

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  This proposed action is for the acquisition of Information Technology services to install Disaster Recovery equipment and for the reconfiguration of TIMS thin client software and database into a cloud-based system.  The purchase will solidify the needed Information Technology services VA would require to stand up a centralized Disaster Recovery solution.  The new Disaster Recovery solution will allow VA to recover TIMS software application in accordance with industry standards, which is Data loss of no more than one hour and to have a fully functional system again within four hours of the incident occurring.  This consolidated Disaster Recovery solution will enhance the ability of TIMS application to handle more claims processors and will be able to handle second shift work with less effort of human Information Technology support.  TIMS consolidated application, consolidated Database and consolidated Disaster Recovery solution will be modified to support over 3,000 Office of Field Operations (OFO) and Education employees supporting the new G.I. Bill for post September 11, 2001, Veterans and the ever growing Veteran community.  The system will continue to be maintained at the Hines Information Technology Center, for training, and testing & development.  The total estimated price of the proposed action is [redacted].  

4.  Statutory Authority:  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(b)(1), only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.  

5.  Use of Authority Cited:  The proposed source for this action is Edge Systems, 3S 721 W Ave, Ste 200, Warrenville, IL  60555.  Edge Systems used its proprietary IMEDGE software to develop TIMS, which is a mission critical business application that supports the processing and payment of Veterans Affairs Education benefits.  The OFO and Education staff that has been hired is required to use TIMS software application to access the data contained in TIMS, which is needed to continue to provide education benefits to our nation's Veterans.  However, the IMEDGE software is the only means by which to access this data.  The only personnel trained and authorized to manipulate the IMEDGE software is Edge Systems.  Therefore, only Edge Systems can provide the aforementioned Information Technology services associated with the TIMS software application.   

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Because the VA has no rights in data for the software code, no other vendor can provide the maintenance and database support services necessary for this requirement; therefore, no other vendor can provide the necessary services to achieve competition.  The proposed action will not be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page based on the exception at FAR 5.202(a)(11).

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Until the new centralized Disaster Recovery solution is implemented, VA is dependent on Edge Systems for all of the Database Maintenance, Hardware Maintenance, Software Maintenance, Technical Support, Licensing Maintenance and various other Maintenance and Support.  Once VA has implemented the new centralized Disaster Recovery solution, there will be enough documented procedures and no proprietary code in the solution for VA to be self-sufficient or capable of fully competing future maintenance needs. 

8.  Market Research:  No market research efforts can be made for the reasons stated in #6, "Efforts to Obtain Competition".  Until the application is transformed through this modification, no other vendors will be able to maintain Edge's proprietary system.  The proposed services are available on GSA schedule GS-35F-0250J.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

All material shall be unloaded as directed, but there is no requirement for the material to be placed in final position at either job site.  Bighorn Canyon personnel shall move the material to its final location.  Material delivery shall begin no earlier than 4/11/2011, and shall be completed no later than 4/28/2011.  Road conditions and delivery site locations restrict the size of trucks that may be used to transport and deliver the material.  Only trucks with a single side-dump trailer may be used to access the two job sites.  Double trailers or dump trucks with pup trailers are not permitted.  Deliveries shall be Monday through Thursday, from 7:00am - 5:30pm. (Friday/Saturday deliveries may be considered to facilitate project completion with the approval of the NPS Contracting Officer.)

WEIGHT AND PAYMENT 
The contractor shall furnish weigh tickets from state certified scales for each delivery made.  Payment will be made on actual quantities delivered and accepted. 
LINE ITEM 001
Quantity is not to exceed 450 tons. The final quantity delivered may be within the range of 425 to 450 tons (nominally twenty truckloads), due to the size and nature of the material, and the specific job site requirements.

If the Contractor delivers and the Government receives quantities of any item in excess of the quantity called for (after considering any allowable variation in quantity), such excess quantities will be treated as being delivered for the convenience of the Contractor. The Government may retain such excess quantities up to $250 in value without compensating the Contractor, and the Contractor waives all right, title, or interests therein.

<DESC>USAID/Regional Financial Management office (RFMO) a) provides financial services to three non-presence countries that includes Swaziland, Lesotho and Botswana; and five presence countries in southern Africa, including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, Madagascar, and Namibia; b) oversees the respective financial management staffs in each country; and c) supports USAID's technical programs, self-help Ambassador's programs, and PEPFAR programs. The Financial Management Office (FMO) provides accounting, audit management, financial analysis, budgeting, payment processing, technical guidance, and staffing coverage to its client missions. This is a challenging position since the incumbent will be responsible for assisting the Controller in rebuilding financial analysis regionally by training and mentoring the financial analysts in RFMO and the client missions and providing templates for "responsibility determinations" for new and existing contractors and grantees. The incumbent will train the financial analysts in the responsibilities required to ensure that prospective grantees have the requisite management, accounting, and operating systems in place to safeguard USG funds and resources prior to the award of new grants and contracts as well as ensure that post-award surveys are done on a timely basis to safeguard USG resources. Many of the financial analysts have less than two years with USAID and the USG and need in-depth mentoring in order to undertake their full roles and responsibilities. In addition, the financial analysts have not been trained in the full range of their responsibilities (i.e., accounting system development and oversight, cost construction reviews, workload counts, pipeline reviews, 1311 analysis, budgeting, accrual management, etc.). It is estimated that the incumbent will spend 60% of his/her time in providing on-the-job training and direction to the financial analysts in the responsibilities of award and audit management and 40% of his/her time providing technical assistance to the technical teams and the FMO.

In no case shall the Government's right to inspect supplies under the inspection provisions of this contract be prejudiced. Shipments of such supplies will not be made under this contract until use of the Certificate of Conformance has been authorized in writing by the CAO, or inspection and acceptance have occurred. <br />(b) The Contractor's signed certificate shall be attached to or included on the top copy of the inspection or receiving report distributed to the payment office or attached to the CAO copy when contract administration (Block 10 of the DD Form 250) is performed by the Defense Contract Administration Services. In addition, a copy of the signed certificate shall also be attached to or entered on copies of the inspection or receiving report accompanying the shipment. <br />(c) The Government has the right to reject defective supplies or services within a reasonable time after delivery by written notification to the Contractor. The Contractor shall in such event promptly replace, correct, or repair the rejected supplies or services at the Contractor's expense. <br />(d) The certificate shall read as follows:</p>

<p>Date of Execution: _____________________________ <br />Signature: _____________________________________ <br />Title: _________________________________________</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.211-8 Time of Delivery (JUNE 1997)(ALT. I, APR 1984) <br />The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE <br />All CLIN's are required 30 calendar days after the date of receipt for each individual purchase order</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate equally, as regards to time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above may be considered unacceptable and may be rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p>OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>All CLIN's As Required ___ calendar days after the date of <br />each individual delivery order</p>
<p>Offeror's Proposed Delivery Schedule <br />Item No. Quantity Within Days After Date of Contract</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary <br />mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer may be determined unacceptable and may be rejected.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>

<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a</p>
<p>Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD), the Senior Transition Program Advisor will:</p>

When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;<br />&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;<br />&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;<br />&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials.<br />&bull; Identify or seek out non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, United States Government (USG) agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;<br />&bull; Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations; <br />&bull; Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing justification documentation when necessary;<br />&bull; Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;<br />&bull; Serve as a liaison with other Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;<br />&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;<br />&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>Travel: All travel performed under this contract shall be reimbursed at cost in accordance with the travel and per diem clause, at G.6. Travel costs being claimed under any Task Order shall be included as a separate line item and be supported.</p>
<p>SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>C.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Highway Institute is the technical training arm of the Federal Highway Administration, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA's overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies. The target audience is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, the Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States. In order for the NHI to best accomplish its training mission it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended message.</p>
<p>The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-led, classroom training on a broad range of topic areas since it was established by congress in 1970. However, the electronic era has rapidly opened new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time.</p>
<p>The typical types of courses currently being offered or under development, the course objectives, and the target audiences are described on the NHI website at http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/.</p>
<p>C.2 CONTRACT OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to effectively and efficiently develop and deliver a timely program of high quality training in the broad general areas of Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical engineering.</p>
<p>C.4 SCOPE</p>
<p>The scope of this contract is limited to the development, revision, promotion, and delivery of training in the broad subject areas of Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical engineering technologies.</p>
<p>This may also include any research required for the development of a specific course, reference manuals, and other support services that may be required for the promotion of the training program.</p>
<p>C.5 TECHNICAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Task Orders under this ID/IQ contract will be determined and issued on an as needed basis by the FHWA.</p>
<p><br />C.6 KICK-OFF MEETING,</p>
<p>If requested by the Government, the contractor shall attend a Kick-off meeting for approximately 2, 4, or 6 hours, which will include the following attendees: the contractor's key personnel, including the Program Manager, the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), and additional FHWA support staff. The Contracting Officer and the cognizant contract administration may also attend the meeting. <br /><br />The purpose of the Kick-off Meeting is to introduce the contractor and Government teams as well as to provide background information, clarify course content issues, define roles and responsibilities, establish timelines and respond to questions. This meeting is generally held at the NHI Office in Arlington, VA.</p>
<p>[Offerors shall include prices for a 2-hour, a 4-hour, and a 6-hour kickoff meeting in person in Arlington, VA and via web conference or videoconference.]</p>
<p>C.7 TASK AREAS</p>
<p>[Note: Offerors are not required to propose to all subject areas (Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical Engineering technologies), and may limit their proposal to selected subject areas based on their strengths/capabilities; however, the Government places a greater value on proposals that provide coverage to a greater number of subject areas than on proposals that provide coverage on only a few tasks.]</p>
<p>This section describes the specific tasks to be addressed and the technical skills necessary and associated with each of the subject areas (Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical Engineering technologies).</p>
<p>Specific work to be performed will be set forth under individual Task Orders. However, Task Orders will generally consist of work in the following areas (Section C.7.1 - C.7.8):</p>
<p>C.7.1 TRAINING NEEDS ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS</p>
<p>The NHI's goal is to optimize the training for maximum effectiveness ensuring the greatest amount of learning takes place within certain defined constraints. This process also involves development of material precisely targeted to student needs. Furthermore, even though achieving a true measurement of the effectiveness of training can be elusive, it is desirable to obtain accurate feedback from course participants and supervisory staff. Work under this task area may be issued to may include, but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Conducting market research of short and long term training needs of all or specified segments of target audiences for the topic areas identified in the Task Order.</p>
<p>(2) Conducting market research of target audiences to determine specific training needs, course objectives and learning outcomes for identified target areas.</p>
<p>(3) Conducting and analyzing post course evaluations to determine effectiveness of delivery methods, course content, and instructional presentation in accomplishing the training objectives.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluating and proposing alternative delivery strategies and learning environments that encourage greater participation and knowledge transfer from the learning environment into the workplace.</p>
<p>C.7.2 TECHNICAL REVIEW AND PANEL COORDINATION</p>
<p>The quality of NHI courses is improved if the interests of selected groups are represented on panels that will provide comments during the course development process. Their review of curriculum material as it evolves can be invaluable. Work under this task area may include, but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing and coordinating panels that represent the FHWA, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and other public and private sector organizations, or individuals to review and provide comments on training needs, curriculum development, and course presentation activities.</p>
<p>C.7.3 COURSE DEVELOPMENT, REVISION, AND UPDATE</p>
<p>The NHI offers a constantly changing array of courses. Some of the courses may need minor revision, while others may require major updating to stay abreast of current technology. In addition, new design procedures, changing specifications, research results, emerging technologies, new regulations, computer programs, etc. continually precipitate the need to develop entirely new courses. In other instances, it may be desirable to convert existing material into a more appropriate format that allows for course participation at a distance.</p>
<p>The NHI's goal is to optimize training for maximum effectiveness, ensuring that the greatest amount of learning takes place within certain defined constraints. This process involves development of material precisely targeted to participant needs and providing clearly articulated Learning Outcomes. The principles of adult learning and Instructional System Design shall be incorporated into each course, as well as a learning assessment (i.e. pre and post tests, exercises, skill demonstration, etc) in order to be consistent with IACET (International Association of Continuing Education and Training) requirements. The training shall include a combination of instructional strategies such as lectures, videos, case studies, group exercises/discussions, and interactive technology that enhances participation (such as audience response systems, etc). The training shall also be learner-centric and not instructor-centric.</p>
<p>Adult Learning Considerations</p>
<p>Before revising, developing, or presenting any training program targeted at adult audiences, it is first useful to gain an appreciation of the difference between child-centered learning and adult- centered learning. Almost all of us have experienced 12 or more years of education as children and many of us have experienced additional years of education as young adults. The educational models fixed in our minds are the pedagogical models-- the art and science of teaching children--drawn from those experiences. As adult trainers, it is easy for us to teach as we were taught rather than implement good adult learning principles.</p>
<p>We know the following things about adult learners:</p>
<p>&bull; Adults have a need to know why they should learn something. One of the first tasks of the adult trainer is to develop a "need to know" in the learner - to demonstrate the value of what is being offered to them.<br />&bull; Adults have a deep need to be self-directed. However, often when they enter a program labeled "education" or "training" they revert back to their conditioning as children, put on their hats of dependency, fold their arms, sit back and say, "Teach me." This puts them at immediate odds with their need for self-direction, causes inner conflict and a resistance to participation in training. To resolve this as adult trainers we must help adult learners make a quick transition from seeing themselves as dependent learners to becoming self-directed.<br />&bull; Adults have a greater volume and different quality of experience than children. Adults bring into the learning situation a background of experience that is itself a rich resource for many kinds of learning for themselves and others. Adults have a broader base of experience to which to attach new ideas and skills and give them richer meaning. The greater experience, however, also has a potential negative consequence. The greater experience can cause people to develop habits of thought and bias, to make presuppositions, to be less open to new ideas. Evidence indicates that this phenomenon is especially characteristic of undereducated adults.<br />&bull; Adults become ready to learn when they experience in their life situation a need to know or be able to do in order to perform more effectively and with greater satisfaction. Adults learn best when they choose voluntarily to make a commitment to learn.<br />&bull; Adults enter into a learning experience with a task-centered (or problem-centered) orientation to learning. Adult learning activities are better received when designed around tasks, problems, or life situations. Very often, if they can apply what they have learned to a recent experience or situation, they can better appreciate the newfound knowledge and skills.<br />&bull; Adults are motivated to learn by both extrinsic and intrinsic motivators. The problem is they may not be motivated to learn what we want to teach them, hence the importance to develop "a need to know" as a basic ingredient of adult training. The most potent and persistent motivators for adults are intrinsic motivators such as self-esteem, broadened responsibilities, power, and achievement.</p>
<p>Implications for Practice</p>
<p>Adult learning concepts--combined with an understanding of the training need--suggest the following approach to course design:</p>
<p>&bull; Participants want to have a chance to tailor knowledge to their local situation.<br />&bull; Participants want to have an opportunity to interact with others during the training session.<br />&bull; Participants want to understand why something is important.<br />&bull; Participants have a need for training that will demonstrate the benefits of learning.</p>
<p>Learner-Centric Instruction</p>
<p>In an effort to make training more effective and move the content into working environments, the NHI believes in learner-centric instruction. The core principles for learner-centric instruction are those in which learners, with a facilitator's guidance, are made responsible for constructing their own comprehension and potential usage of the course content. As the term implies, it is an instructional approach in which the learner is placed at the center of training. In such a setting, the individual involvement of the learners in the learning process is emphasized through their active participation in building up knowledge and understanding. Instructors play a facilitatory role in the process. The main players and constructors of knowledge and learning experiences are the learners themselves.</p>
<p>There are actually three ultimate goals that are ideally reached through learner-centered strategies. They are:</p>
<p>1. The development of inquiry and problem solving skills<br />2. The development of deep understanding of topics and<br />3. The development of democratic processes (e.g. critical examination of our own and other's positions)</p>
<p>Learning environments are contextualized to meet the real learning needs of the learners. This means that learners are provided with authentic learning experiences and activities that require an understanding similar to the one required in real world settings. Additionally, the learning environment is set to accommodate a variety of instructional tools and methods as well as flexible arrangements of time and place. Learning centered approaches cater to the diversity of participants' abilities and learning modalities and attempt to attend to participants' varying learning needs. Learner-centered approaches are best applied to invoke higher-level thinking, inquiry, and problem solving skills. What is at the essence of the learner-centered approach is that learners are internally motivated and are active participants in the knowledge gain process mediated through personal and interpersonal interactions.</p>
<p>Examples of learner-centered educational practices include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborative group learning, both inside and outside the classroom <br />&bull; Individual participant research and discovery<br />&bull; Research and discovery by participants and teacher together <br />&bull; Problem-based inquiry learning<br />&bull; Participant-teacher studio and performance activities <br />&bull; Hands-on, experiential learning activities<br />&bull; On-site field experiences<br />&bull; Self-paced tutorials</p>
<p>Learning Assessment</p>
<p>The NHI is approved to award International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET) continuing education units (CEUs) and as such, follows Bloom's Taxonomy of learning levels including associated outcome and assessment development. As part of a continuous improvement process and to conform to IACET standards, NHI has instituted a course design policy to include a post-course assessment. Selection of this learning evaluation tool is an Instructional Systems design (ISD) decision and shall be designed to measure participant performance with the course learning outcomes. Acceptable tools include case studies, skills demonstrations, and objective tests.</p>
<p>To this end, the contractor shall develop "end of course assessments" that fully measure mastery of each overall course learning outcome (a Kirkpatrick Level II evaluation), but not necessarily each lesson outcome. The assessment shall form a comprehensive end of course evaluation of the participant's retention of critical skills and knowledge for successful job performance after training.</p>
<p>Participants should be able to complete the assessment within 45 minutes. Time to administer the test shall be reflected in the course agenda. In developing the assessment tools, the contractor shall include objective measures such as multiple choice questions, matching questions, or methods that require critical thinking such as case studies or skills demonstrations. Subjective formats such as case studies shall have clearly stated response criteria or parameters to reduce subjectivity when evaluating participant responses. The assessments shall be designed so that a score of 70 is considered "passing."</p>
<p>Tests are used to measure and document a student's knowledge, cognitive ability, and performance of job tasks. The specific type of test item to use should be determined by the behavior specified in the outcome to be tested and the instructional delivery system used. Various types of test items as described below, may be used to document and measure the specified criteria:</p>
<p>Test Item Type Characteristics <br />Multiple-choice &bull; Useful for testing knowledge and cognitive abilities. <br />&bull; Consists of a stem and four responses. <br />Matching &bull; Useful for testing terms and labels. <br />&bull; Consists of two columns of related words, phrases, or symbols to be matched by the student. <br />True/False &bull; Useful for testing knowledge. <br />&bull; Consists of a single statement. <br />&bull; Not more than 10% of questions may be True/False<br />Completion or "fill in the blank" &bull; Useful for testing recall of knowledge committed to memory. <br />&bull; Consists of a statement from which a word(s) or short phrase has been omitted. The student must supply the missing word(s) or phrase in the blank(s) provided. <br />Performance &bull; Useful for testing job tasks and skills. <br />&bull; Consists of a simulated or actual environment with certain conditions of performance and certain expected outcomes.</p>
<p>When so specified in a Task Order, the contractor shall develop the required test items, and all required supplemental materials (e.g., instructions for the instructor, instructions for the student, scoring procedures, answer key, etc.). Delivery and review of test items will coincide with delivery of draft course materials.</p>
<p>The number of test items shall be sufficient to adequately measure a student's mastery of each course learning outcome. The contractor shall develop, when so specified in a Task Order, at least 3 versions of each test.</p>
<p>Task Orders</p>
<p>Under each task area, work may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Developing, revising, or updating curriculum material including course outlines, instructor guides, participant notebooks, reference manuals, and visual aids using innovative methods of increasing participation of course participants.</p>
<p>&bull; Developing new or converting existing curriculum material into a format that can be delivered by distance learning such as through web-conferencing, web-based, or other electronic medium using innovative methods of increasing participation of course participants.</p>
<p>Individuals involved in an NHI course development include the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), the Technical Review Team (i.e. FHWA technical lead contact, other agency representatives, target audience reps, stakeholders, etc) and the Contractor Project Team (both subject matter experts and instructional systems designers). The stages in an NHI course development process, include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>(1) Kick-off Meeting</p>
<p>The kick-off meeting typically includes the following attendees: the contractor's key development personnel, including the contractor's Instructional System Designer (for course development task orders), the COTR, the FHWA technical review panel and the Contracting Officer, if available. The purpose of the Kick-off Meeting is to introduce the team, review the scope of the task order, provide background information, review course and reference manual draft outlines, clarify course content issues, define roles and responsibilities, establish timelines and respond to questions. This meeting is generally held at the NHI facility in Arlington, VA.</p>
<p>For any course development Task Orders awarded under this contract, the contractor shall prepare the agenda for each kickoff meeting, lead the discussion, prepare, and deliver minutes to demonstrate understanding of key decisions and to solicit approval of understanding as needed.</p>
<p>The contractor shall bring to each course development kick-off meeting the draft course and reference manual outlines and a work plan/schedule, and be prepared to lead a discussion of their ideas for updating the course and reference manuals.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also be prepared to discuss the development and review schedule for all deliverables, by Task. The schedule shall be determined at this meeting. Further, the timeframe for the various technical reviews, progress meetings, walkthroughs, and the Pilot Course delivery shall also be discussed and agreed upon at this meeting. Once agreed to, the schedule will become a part of the task order and may thereafter only be changed by the Contracting Officer. The specific details for Kick-off meetings will be included in each Task Order proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Progress Meetings</p>

<p>All funds expended under this contract shall be incurred, accounted for, and invoiced under individual Task Orders.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to provide all contractors awarded a contract under this solicitation a fair opportunity to be considered for each proposed Task Order in the topic awarded. The Government expects to issue a solicitation for a Task Order proposal to all eligible contractors asking for a technical proposal and pricing information. However, the Government may issue Task Orders on a non-competitive basis or limited competitive basis as may be appropriate and authorized by regulation.

Task Order solicitations will specify the evaluation criteria that will be utilized together with a statement of the relative importance of each criterion. In accordance with FAR 16.505 (a) (9) (i), the selection of a contractor to perform a Task Order is not subject to protest, except in limited circumstances. Each Task Order will provide specific information on the work to be performed, the objectives or results desired, a period of performance, deliverables, pricing and other terms specific to the individual Task Order.</p>
<p>The work shall be conducted by the contractor on an as needed basis, within the scope of the contract. The exact nature and extent of the contractor's work under this contract will be based upon written Task Order Proposal Request (TOPR) developed by the Government, once work is identified.

<p>The Contracting Officer may enter into negotiations with those contractors submitting a TOP, and may request a revised TOP, as the situation may warrant.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each TOP in accordance with the stated evaluation criteria, and will award the Task Order to the contractor who offers the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Upon mutual agreement of the parties as to the work to be performed, the schedule, and the pricing, the FHWA will issue a Task Order. The contractor shall acknowledge acceptance of the Task Order and shall immediately proceed with the conduct of the work.</p>

<p>G.5 AGENCY TASK ORDER OMBUDSMAN</p>

Accordingly, in accordance with FAR 16.505 (b) (5), an ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of contractor's concerns resulting from task order award. The existence of the ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with the ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for resolution.</p>
<p>If the Contracting Officer cannot make resolution, interested parties may contact the FHWA ombudsman, Ms. Patricia Prosperi, at the following address:</p>

Unused tickets paid for by the Government must be sent promptly to the Contracting Officer, unless it is likely they can be reissued for a later trip and the company maintains an adequate accounting system to protect the tickets from misuse, and insures the Government will not be billed for the subsequent trip. Complete justification and accounting must be provided with the invoice.</p>

<p>Requests for use of a rental car shall always be justified, in advance of travel. Rental car use is to be the exception rather than the rule.

It is anticipated that in performance of this contract, the contractor may require access to, or receipt of, information and data relating to FHWA's plans, programs, technical requirements, and budgetary matters, and such other information, the disclosure of which may give competitive advantage to recipients or would be adverse to the interests of the Government.</p>
<p>b. The contractor shall not disclose such information acquired to anyone, other than those contractor, subcontractor, or consultant personnel performing work under this contract, without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer, until such time as the Government may have authorized the release of such information and data to the public.</p>
<p>c. To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other companies, and as long as such data remains proprietary or confidential, the contractor shall protect such data from unauthorized use and disclosure and agrees not to use it to compete against such companies.</p>
<p>d. It is anticipated that during performance of this contract, the contractor may be issued Task Orders involving technical evaluations of other contractor's offers or products. FAR 9.505-3 provides that contracts shall not generally be awarded to a contractor that would evaluate, or advise the Government concerning, its own products or activities, or those of a competitor, without proper safeguards to ensure objectivity and protect the Government's interest. These safeguards will be accomplished by restricting future contracting with the Government, as delineated below.</p>
<p>e. FHWA will not unilaterally disclose to the contractor any proprietary information furnished by domestic or foreign participants in FHWA's programs. If the contractor requires access to such information in performance of this contract, an agreement concerning release and restrictions on the use of such data must be sought by the contractor with the source of the data.</p>
<p>f. It is required by the parties of this contract, that the contractor will be restricted in its future contracting with the Government, for any service or product which may encompass information acquired under items a and c above that is not publicly available and could give a competitive advantage to the contractor or would be adverse to the interests of the Government. Accordingly, the contractor shall be ineligible to perform as a prime contractor, subcontractor or consultant, or in any capacity to any supplier under an ensuring Government contract. Any questions on this matter shall be immediately addressed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>g. These restrictions do not limit the contractor's right to use and disclose any information and data obtained from another source without restriction.</p>
<p>h. The contractor agrees to train its employees who will have access to such sensitive information in all necessary security procedures and required them to sign non-disclosure statements and certificates attesting to their understanding of the requirements for safeguarding such information.</p>
<p>i. In the event that the contractor fails to comply with this provision of the contract, the Government may terminate the contract for default.</p>
<p>j. The contractor shall include this provision, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts and consultant agreements for performance of work under this contract unless excused in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>1252.245-70 GOVERNMENT PROPERTY REPORTS (OCT 1994)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall prepare an annual report of Government property in its possession and the possession of its subcontractors.</p>
<p>(b) The report shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer not later than September 15 of each calendar year on Form DOT F 4220.43, contractor Report of Government Property.</p>
<p>H.5 POST AWARD EVALUATION OF CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE</p>

<p>Annual and final evaluations of contractor performance will be prepared on this contract/task order in accordance with FAR 42.15. The final performance evaluation will be prepared after completion of all work. Annual and final evaluations will be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluations. The contractor can elect to review the evaluation and submit additional information or a rebuttal statement within thirty days. Contractor response is voluntary. Any disagreement between the parties regarding an evaluation will be referred to a Reviewing Official at a level above the Contracting Officer, whose decision is final.</p>
<p>Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the contract file, and may be used to support future award decisions.</p>
<p>b. Electronic Access to Contractor Performance Evaluations</p>
<p>The Department of Transportation currently utilizes the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System, to record and maintain past performance information (CPARS). The contractor shall identify an individual who has authorized access to the evaluation for review and comment to serve as its primary contact. In addition, the contractor shall identify a secondary contact responsible for notifying the Contracting Officer in the event the primary contact is unavailable to process the evaluation within the required 30-day time period.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will register the contract in CPARS and assign roles for the contractor and Contracting Officer Technical Representative in CPARS. A system generated e-mail from CPARS will be sent to both individuals notifying them of their roles and the contract/task order number registered in CPARS.</p>
<p>Complete registration and user procedures will be provided once CPARS is available to the agency.</p>
<p><br />H.6 SOURCE CODE FOR SOFTWARE</p>
<p>Delivery of all source code for software developed under this contract shall be in electronic format or as detailed in the respective Task Order.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other clause in this contract, the FHWA will have "unlimited rights", as that term is defined in FAR 27.401, in the software and source code delivered under this contract. As a result, the FHWA may modify and distribute the software and source code to the public, including employees of state departments of transportation, without restriction.</p>
<p>H.7 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</p>
<p>The contractor and subcontractors shall not copyright any paper, reports, forms, software, or other materials which are first developed under and are a part of its work under this contract without written approval of the Contracting Officer, and all proprietary rights to materials first developed under this contract shall rest solely with the Government, with no compensation to the contractor or subcontractors beyond the payments made under this contract. The Contractor and subcontractors agree that all copyright and patent right to materials, programs, reports, software, inventions and all other intellectual property developed under this contract shall be the property of the Government, and thereby assigns such reports and intellectual property to the Government. Upon completion or termination of this agreement, all reports prepared by the contractor or subcontractors, including all graphics, texts, and computer files, as instruments of service, shall become the property of the Government.</p>
<p>In addition to the paragraph above, the term "contractor property" shall mean all pre-existing materials, including, but not limited to, any products, software, materials and methodologies and processes related to contractor's or subcontractors' products or services, all of which shall remain in the sole and exclusive property of the contractor or subcontractor or suppliers. Subject to receipt of payment in full and to the terms of this contract, the contractor and subcontractor grants the Government a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use the contractor property contained in the deliverables provided hereunder for purposes of the contract.</p>
<p>H.8 RECORDS MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall comply with all Federal and DOT records management regulations regarding Federal recordkeeping requirements including the creation, maintenance and use, and disposition of records in all media (paper, electronic, audiovisual, Web sites, etc.).</p>

FRAUDULENT LETTERS</p>
<p>*****ALERT**** FRAUDULENT CCR LETTERS***********</p>
<p>Recently, U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) contractors and potential contractors have received fraudulent letters purporting to be issued by DOT. Often the letters have been signed by "John Duncan, Senior Procurement Officer". These fraudulent letters request that current or potential contractors resubmit their Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) banking information to DOT. If you receive such a letter, please DO NOT complete the requested CCR worksheet that is attached to the letters and DO NOT release any information to the facsimile number cited in the letter. Please be aware that no Federal agency requires any confidential information to be submitted to verify CCR registration. The CCR is a legitimate government system. However, to register, contractors should go directly through the CCR website and never through a third party. There is no requirement to send information directly to any Federal agency. For information on how to register in the CCR, please visit website http://www.ccr.gov/.</p>
<p>The point of contact concerning these fraudulent letters is the DOT Office of the Inspector General. You should call their hotline at 1-800-424-9071.</p>

<p>L.8 NOTICE TO OFFERORS</p>
<p>The offeror's response must demonstrate their understanding of this procurement and capability for high quality performance in a concise, logical, manner and should not contain superfluous material that is not directly related to this procurement. Contractors must above all show that, if selected for award, they will be able to provide high quality, effective training and course materials. Proposals should address each area in Section C above using innovative, adult learning, training techniques proposed in ways that instructor led training will have maximum impact. Offerors may submit proposals for one, two or all three topic areas (Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical). The technical proposals shall not exceed 20 pages per topic area and shall include a brief well written Executive Summary covering the technical and cost parts of the proposal. Any material in excess of the 20 pages per topic area for the technical proposal will not be read or evaluated.</p>
<p>The pricing proposal, staff resumes, subcontractor information, covers, table of contents, letters of commitment, the Executive Summary and the past performance material is in addition to the page limits for the 20 page (Per each topic area) technical proposals.</p>
<p>Company, University, or Transportation Center descriptive brochures may be included and are not part of the page limitations. You may wish to refer us to a company/organization website for additional information rather than take up pages unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Present your proposal in a logical manner readily tied to the requirements herein. Each topic area is to be treated separately as they will be evaluated individually. Identify and explain any exceptions you are taking to the proposed contract requirements.</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify those who they intend to utilize in key positions in performance of any Task Orders issued. These include staff, consultants, or subcontractors. Resumes of all proposed key personnel are required, and may not exceed 3 pages for each person proposed. You must indicate educational background, recent relevant experience, specific or technical accomplishments, and a listing of relevant publications. State his or her proposed duties, and the areas for which he or she will be responsible. The work to be performed requires seasoned instructors, professional expertise, and sophisticated engineering and technical data gathering and analysis capability. Instructors involved in delivering NHI learning events must also demonstrate high standards of professional conduct and do not discriminate against learners on the basis of gender, age, socioeconomic or ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.</p>
<p>For all personnel who are not currently members of the offeror's staff, an original letter of commitment and agreement to serve as planned is required to be submitted with your proposal. The letter must cite this solicitation number. These same requirements apply when proposing key personnel for a Task Order, with the letter citing the proposed Task Order number. A resume alone does not meet this requirement.</p>
<p>Describe your organization's technical capabilities to perform the kinds of work described under each topic area for which you wish to be awarded a contract. Clarity and completeness are of the utmost importance in the proposal. With the exceptions of the responsibility determination and the past performance evaluations, only material contained within the proposal will be considered in the source evaluation and selection process. Therefore, be sure to include everything you want to be evaluated. Even if we know you and/or members of your staff, we will only consider what is contained within the proposal.</p>
<p>Offerors are allowed 6 additional pages for the Executive Summary covering the organization, capabilities, experience, and management structure. Address your management of the contract and each Task Order. Explain your methods for performing and managing multiple Task Orders. Address how you would staff multiple Tasks, multiple courses at the same time, writing and teaching at the same time, how many courses you could deliver per month, and how you would replace key personnel if necessary, so as not to delay or degrade performance even when faced with a last minute loss of an individual. Outline your methodology for selecting and managing subcontractors and consultants if you plan to utilize them. Provide the minimum lead-time you would require to commence work after receipt of a Task Order.</p>
<p>This Request for Proposals is written in the Uniform Contract Format described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 15.204-1. Offerors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the Uniform Contract Format. This will facilitate your understanding of the terms and conditions of this solicitation, these instructions, and the source selection process.

<p>L.12 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION</p>
<p>All Contractors desiring to receive awards of DOT contracts, purchase orders, delivery orders, or other contractual vehicles must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving an award, and throughout the contract's period of performance. The CCR is a Federal Government web-based repository of Contractor information.</p>
<p>Interested Offerors should read and understand the requirements of FAR 52.204-7. The Offeror must register in the CCR prior to receiving any DOT contract awards, and must maintain current, updated information in CCR throughout the performance period of the contract. The Electronic Funds Transfer information in the CCR must be accurate in order for Contractors' invoices or contract financing requests to be considered proper invoices for the purpose of prompt payment under DOT contracts. Offerors can register in CCR at any time and are encouraged to do so immediately.</p>
<p>Offerors may register in the CCR database and obtain additional information at http://www.ccr.gov, or by calling 1-888-227-2423. The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the DOT's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor must confirm on an annual basis that its information in the database is accurate and complete.</p>
<p>*****ALERT**** FRAUDULENT CCR LETTERS***********<br />Recently, current U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Contractors and potential Contractors have received fraudulent letters purporting to be issued by DOT. These fraudulent letters request that current or potential Contractors register in the Central Contractor Registration System (CCR). If you receive such a letter, please DO NOT complete the requested CCR worksheet that is attached to the letters and DO NOT release any information to the facsimile number cited in the letter. Please be aware that no Federal agency requires any confidential information to be submitted to verify CCR registration. The CCR is a legitimate government system. However, to register, Contractors should go directly through the CCR website and never through a third party. There is no requirement to send information directly to any Federal agency. For information on how to register in the CCR, please visit website http://www.ccr.gov/ or call 1-888-227-2423.</p>

Failure to submit any of the information requested by this RFP may be cause for unfavorable consideration.

A significant inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental question of the Offeror's understanding of the work required, and ability to perform the contract.</p>
<p>The Offeror's response should demonstrate its understanding of this procurement and capability for performance in a concise, logical, manner and should not contain superfluous material which is not directly related to this procurement.</p>
<p>This RFP is written in the Uniform Contract Format described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 15.204-1. Offerors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the Uniform Contract Format. This will facilitate their understanding of the terms and conditions of this solicitation, the instructions which follow, and the source selection process.</p>

<p>L.14 PROCEDURE</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each offeror's written proposal (all volumes) for responsiveness to proposal specifications.</p>
<p>Based on an examination of the pertinent information set forth within each offeror's initially-submitted written "Volume I - Relevant Technical Capabilities" proposal, the Government will evaluate each offeror's proposed approach for:</p>
<p>&bull; The offeror's proposed staff member's qualifications and experience in accordance with the Selection Factors as set forth below in Section M of this Solicitation <br />&bull; The offer's understanding of and approach to technical services support in accordance with the Selection Factor as set forth below in Section M of this Solicitation <br />&bull; The offeror's ability to provide technical assistance in the required technical, functional, and situational competencies in accordance with the Selection Factor as set forth below in Section M of this Solicitation</p>
<p>The Government will combine the results of the initial evaluations performed under M.2 to arrive at an overall evaluation for each offeror. The Government will next examine each offeror's price in accordance with Selection Factor 4 as set forth in Section M of this solicitation. The Government will then establish a competitive range.</p>
<p>(Optional: The Government Reserves the Right to Award a Contract Without Discussions): The Government reserves the right to award the contract(s), without discussion, to the most competitive offeror(s). It is therefore imperative that each offeror's initially-submitted written proposal present the offeror's best terms and be thoroughly documented.</p>
<p>If and only if the Government decides to hold discussions, then the Government may invite the offerors within the competitive range to negotiations/discussions.</p>

<p>DO NOT place any past performance information, any experience descriptions, any resumes, executed Standard Form 33, RFP, Section K, or any Subcontracting Plans in Volume II.</p>
<p>&bull; Volume I - the combined total page count shall not exceed 150 pages. The 150-page limit includes all resumes. The 150-page limit also includes all letters, figures, tables, title pages, appendices and other ancillary materials.</p>

<p>Note: It is requested (but it is not required) that all binding be in the form of a plastic spiral binder at the left margin. Do not use paper clips or staples as binding.</p>
<p>Volume I - Font, graphic, page, and formatting specifications</p>
<p>Each double-sided page shall count as two pages for purposes of the page limitations noted above and in this paragraph. The Past Performance Questionnaires should not be included inside Volume I, and will not count in the page count. Except as stated below in this paragraph, Volume I shall be presented in 12 point font or larger. Subject to the exception stated in the next sentence, the dimensions of each page in Volume I shall be no greater than 8 &frac12; inches by 14 inches. Up to 20 of the 150 maximum pages in Volume I may be "fold-out" pages having dimensions not exceeding 8 &frac12; inches by 14 inches ----provided that any such fold-out pages are bound into Volume I and are folded down to a size not exceeding 8 &frac12; inches by 14 inches. Footnotes, legends, or labels associated with tables or diagrams, and other information which is ancillary to the main text, may be presented in a font size smaller than twelve point font---provided that any such smaller font is fully legible. Resumes are not considered ancillary material, and must therefore be presented in 12 point font or larger. Resumes may not be presented on fold-out pages. If, in order to place its entire Master Staffing Table on just one page (probably a fold-out page) an offeror needs to use a font size smaller than 12 point, then the offeror may do so, provided that the font size used on the Master Staffing Table is fully legible.</p>
<p>Experience descriptions and completed Past Performance Questionnaires shall be provided only for work that was performed in a significant way by key personnel who are being proposed to SERVE on this particular contract. Names and the Roles of those being proposed to serve on this particular project shall be identified on each experience description and on each Past Performance Questionnaire submitted in the proposal. The role of the person who worked on the Past Performance shall be clearly indicated in the write-up.</p>
<p>VOLUME I - RELEVANT TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>PART I - Staffing</p>
<p>A. Provide a Table of Key Personnel and Their Other Commitments <br />Provide resumes and a table showing the names of all proposed Key Personnel. For purposes of constructing that required table, the term "Key Personnel" shall include the:</p>
<p>&bull; Principal Investigator <br />&bull; Project Manager <br />&bull; Instructors<br />&bull; Instructional Systems Designer (for development teams)</p>
<p>For each such individual, show the following, in that table: the name of the individual's employer; the position that the individual is proposed to occupy on this particular project; the project name and the contract number of every other project (Federal and non-Federal) on which the individual is currently committed to serve at any time during the period beginning on July 23, 2011 and ending on February 22, 2016; and, the number of hours that the individual is estimated to serve on each such "other project" in each year of that period. For purposes of this required table, an individual is "committed" to serve on only those "other projects" for which there is already in existence a signed contract, a signed task order, or some other mutually-binding written agreement. In other words, this table need not show "other projects" that are merely in the bidding phase and are not yet awarded.</p>
<p>B. Provide Resumes for Other than Key Personnel</p>
<p>Resumes shall be submitted for each of the remaining proposed labor category as identified in except that no resume is required for any administrative support personnel.</p>
<p>Each resume shall clearly identify and describe the individual's related project experience and education as it relates to the performance of this contract and the position descriptions. The firm that the personnel work for should also be clearly identified.</p>
<p>C. Provide a Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix</p>
<p>Each offeror shall provide a Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix that crosswalk the personnel listed in the resumes to the competencies areas and tasks.</p>
<p>The Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix must be a comprehensive one which covers not only the prime offeror's proposed internal staffing, but also the staffing proposed for each separate subcontractor and consultant. Resumes must support the ratings given in this matrix so that the ratings are substantiated and validated.</p>
<p>It is requested----but it is not required----that the entire Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix be presented on just one page. Recall that under the circumstances specified above in "Page and Size Limits for Volume I", an offeror might qualify for using, in the Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix, a font size smaller than 12-point.</p>
<p>Labor Categories<br /><br />The following skills/disciplines and/or expertise are believed to be necessary for the successful completion, of all topic areas, of the contract, although every discipline may not be applicable to each and every task order, and the offeror is free to utilize any discipline it chooses to successfully perform the contract.</p>
<p>Labor Categories<br />1) Senior subject matter expert (bridge design, bridge inspection, geotechnical engineering and hydraulics engineering) <br />2) Mid-level subject matter expert (bridge design, bridge inspection, geotechnical engineering and hydraulics engineering) <br />3) Junior-level subject matter expert (bridge design, bridge inspection, geotechnical engineering and hydraulics engineering)<br />4) Senior Program Manager/Principal Investigator<br />5) Mid-level Program Manager/Principal Investigator<br />6) Senior Bridge Design/Bridge Inspection/Geotechnical/Hydraulics Instructor<br />7) Mid-Level Bridge Design/Bridge Inspection/Geotechnical/Hydraulics Instructor<br />8) Junior Bridge Design/Bridge Inspection/Geotechnical/Hydraulics Instructor<br />9) Senior-level Instructional Systems Designer<br />10) Mid-level Instructional Systems Designer<br />11) Junior-level Instructional Systems Designer<br />12) Administrative Support personnel<br />13) Senior-level 2D and 3D Modelers and Animators<br />14) Mid-level 2D and 3D Modelers and Animators<br />15) Junior-level 2D and 3D Modelers and Animators<br />16) Senior-level (Graphic Artist, Web Developer, Writer/Editor, Programmer, Research/Technical Writer)<br />17) Mid-level (Graphic Artist, Web Developer, Writer/Editor, Programmer, Research/Technical Writer)<br />18) Junior-level (Graphic Artist, Web Developer, Writer/Editor, Programmer, Research/Technical Writer)</p>
<p>PART II - Approach to the Work Program</p>
<p>Section C of the RFP includes a Statement of Work for the program. The purpose of this part of the offeror's response is to present the knowledge, understanding, and approach to addressing the work tasks that are anticipated. This response is not meant to regurgitate the Section C requirements, but to talk about the understanding of the issues involved, the approach to addressing such issues, and the unique experience of the offerors team to address such considerations. Due to the number of tasks and the page limitations, this will require the offeror to be concise and succinct.</p>
<p>PART III - 5 Sealed Past Performance Questionnaires (in Original Proposal only)</p>
<p>Each offeror's initially-submitted written proposal shall include no more than ten Past Performance Questionnaires completed by organizations for whom the offeror has performed or is performing work. The requirements (and the exceptions) as to the relevancy of the projects to be cited in those five Past Performance Questionnaires are the same as are given above for the Contract/Subcontract Experience Descriptions. Each prime offeror should attempt to include----within the five completed Past Performance Questionnaires----one Questionnaire describing work performed by each separate proposed major subcontractors on the Offerors team.</p>
<p>IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL FIVE OF THE COMPLETED PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRES ARRIVE IN THE FHWA'S OFFICE OF ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT IN THE VERY SAME OUTER BOX OR OUTER CONTAINER THAT ALSO ENCLOSES THE OTHER PORTIONS OF THE OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL. IN OTHER WORDS, THE PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRES CANNOT BE SUBMITTED SEPARATELY FROM THE OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>Each separate Past Performance Questionnaire should be sealed by the customer who completed it, and must then be forwarded by that customer to the offeror, for inclusion in the offeror's proposal. <br />In the original of the Volume II proposal, include a minimum of five completed Past Performance Questionnaires by the Offeror's customers <br /><br />1. The completed questionnaires must be submitted by current (within the last three years) customers (both commercial and Government) involving similar or related services.</p>
<p>2. The completed questionnaires shall be from independent sources.</p>
<p>3. Offerors must submit each completed customer questionnaire in a separate envelope that has been sealed by the customer for confidentiality.</p>
<p>4. The Government may contact the customer point of contact (POC) for verification. POC telephone and facsimile numbers must be accurate and current.</p>
<p>5. Failure to provide complete information regarding previous similar and/or related contracts may result in eventual disqualification. The CO will consider such performance information along with other factors in determining whether the Offeror is to be considered responsible, as defined in FAR 9.101. The Offeror is responsible for ensuring the questionnaires are completed in a timely manner and are submitted with its proposal.</p>
<p>NOTE: In evaluating an offeror's past performance, the FHWA reserves: (a) the right to look beyond the Past Performance Questionnaires submitted by the offeror, and the right to perform its own research into the offeror's past performance; and (b) the right to take into account any other information (not provided by the offeror) which the U. S. Department of Transportation possesses regarding the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Past Performance Questionnaire Projects May Overlap with Projects Cited In Contract/Subcontract Experience Descriptions</p>
<p>There is no requirement that the projects cited in an offeror's Past Performance Questionnaires be different from the projects cited in the offeror's Contract/Subcontract Experience Descriptions. An overlap is permissible.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - Cost/Price Information</p>
<p>This volume shall include all pricing information and certain general financial/organizational information, as described below:</p>
<p><br />PART I - Cost/Price Information</p>
<p>1. The cost/price information is meant to determine an overall cost contract by the offerors team, as well as understand the details and assumptions that are included in the offeror's price for services. The man-hours for all labor categories and basic Other Direct Costs (ODC's) (See L.17 Below) that are anticipated have been estimated by the Government and are provided below (L.18 Estimated Level of Effort) for all, offerors as an input to the cost/price information preparation. It is recommended that the Estimates are used in completing the cost and price information and the calculations are clearly indicated herein. All offerors shall submit:</p>
<p>a. Direct Labor Breakdown - Provide the costs for personnel, by labor category, that are anticipated over the five years of the contract period of performance. As a part of the Excel spreadsheet (Attachment E), the annual increases in labor cost escalation should also be inputted by the offeror to reflect anticipated changes in labor costs over the five year period.</p>
<p>b. Other Direct Costs - Base year other direct costs (ODC's) are estimated by the Government and are included below in section L.18. As a part of the Excel spreadsheet, the annual increases in travel, equipment/materials, and other additional costs escalation should also be inputted by the offeror to reflect anticipated changes in ODCs over the five year period.</p>
<p>The offeror may provide comments on ODC costs that they feel should be added, or deleted, due to their cost structure or assumptions. They may be addressed if they are short listed or selected for contract negotiations with the Government.</p>
<p>c. Start-up Activities - For the first-year budget summary for Competency Area/Task 4.2.2 Start-Up Activities, a subsidiary budget summary showing only, and all of, the offeror's proposed costs and fee for any "Start-Up Task Order" desired by the offeror; or, as an alternative to submitting that subsidiary budget summary for the Competency Area/Task 4.2.2 Start-Up Activities, submit a certification that the offeror is not requesting a Start-Up Task Order and that the offeror will recover start-up costs, if at all, only through the application of the offeror's approved indirect cost rates</p>
<p>d. Assumptions Made in Estimating Costs - For each of the above cost items, the offeror shall clearly indicate any assumptions and conditions that have been made in estimating costs. These will be important to both evaluating costs as well as may be discussed in future contract negotiations if short listing or contract negotiations are initiated.</p>
<p>e. A separate budget summary showing the total proposed price for each separate year of the project; thus each offeror shall submit five of those yearly budget summaries.</p>
<p>Budget summaries shall clearly identify the following information and utilize the following criteria as applicable:</p>
<p>a. loaded labor by labor categories and by named individual, to include hours, un-loaded hourly pay rates, and pay escalations. These data shall be provided for the prime offeror and for all proposed subcontractors and affiliates.</p>
<p>b. Other direct costs and travel costs (see sub-paragraphs b above) need not be itemized----except that any ODCs and any travel costs proposed for any Start-Up Task Order under Task A should be itemized.</p>
<p>c. Any cost data or cost break-out which positively cannot be fitted and displayed on the applicable DOT Form 4220.44 may be shown on a separate attachment page or pages, to be included in the offeror's cost proposal. It is requested that any such attachment pages be presented immediately below the particular DOT Form 4220.44 to which they apply.</p>
<p>The information described in paragraphs above is necessary to determine the adequacy of the offeror's proposal; to validate that the proposed costs are consistent with the technical proposal; and, to help identify unrealistically priced proposals.</p>
<p>1. Any information submitted must support the price proposed. Include sufficient detail or cross-references to clearly establish the relationship of the information provided to the price proposed. Support any information provided by explanations or supporting rationale as needed to permit the Government to evaluate the documentation. Such information is not considered cost or pricing data, and will not require certification in accordance with FAR 15.804-4.</p>
<p>2. NOTE: Each offeror must either: (a) add applicable indirect costs onto the un-loaded travel costs and onto the un-loaded Other Direct Costs prescribed above; or (b) explicitly confirm that the offeror, if awarded the contract, will never apply any indirect rates to un-loaded travel costs nor to un-loaded Other Direct Costs incurred under any resulting contract.</p>
<p>3. Facilities and Special Equipment, Including Tooling: It is the general policy of the FHWA not to provide general or special purpose equipment, facilities or tooling of a capital nature except in unusual circumstances. Items having a unit cost of less than $1,000 will not be provided to the contractor except as authorized with nonprofit institutions or State and local governments. If special purpose equipment of a capital nature is being proposed, provide a description of the items, details of the proposed cost including competitive prices, and a justification as to why the Government should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.</p>
<p>4. Your proposal must include a statement regarding availability of facilities and equipment necessary to accomplish the required work. If any or all of the required facilities are Government owned, a complete listing of these facilities is required and name of the cognizant Government agency furnishing the facilities and the facilities contract number(s).</p>
<p>PART II - Subcontracts/ Consultants:</p>
<p>If subcontractors and/or individual consultants will be used in carrying out the requirements of this project, the following minimum information concerning the subcontractor shall be furnished:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the subcontractor or consultant.</p>
<p>b. Statement of work and work plan (schedule) for the portion of work to be conducted by the subcontractor or consultant.</p>
<p>c. Names and positions of personnel who will work on the project.</p>
<p>d. A letter or other statement from each proposed consultant and/or subcontractor indicating that he has been approached on the matter of participation in this contract/task order and that he is willing and able to do so in the terms indicated.</p>
<p>e. A cost and price analysis of each Subcontractor/ Consultant proposal, as required under FAR 15.404-3 and in accordance with FAR 52.244-1(b)(7). In addition, show each proposed subcontractor's pricing on separate Contract Pricing Summary forms (DOT Form 4220.44, see Attachment F to this RFP), or show each sub's pricing on equivalent spreadsheets; and, in either case, be sure to show each subcontractor's pricing elements in the same level of analytical detail as is required for the prime offeror's internal pricing. And show each proposed independent consultant's pricing on separate Contract Pricing Summary Forms (or on equivalent spreadsheets), down to the level of the consultant's proposed numbers of staffing hours and the consultant's proposed (unloaded and loaded) hourly consulting pay rate(s) for those proposed hours.</p>
<p>Subcontracting Plan Master Subcontracting Plan (In Volume I Proposal):</p>
<p>Each prime offeror shall include within its Volume I proposal a complete copy of the prime offeror's Master Subcontracting Plan, satisfactorily addressing all of the administrative requirements set forth in FAR section 52.219-9.</p>
<p>Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan (In Volume I Proposal): As prescribed in FAR 52.219-9, if the total contract price is expected to exceed $550,000, the offeror shall include a statement in its offer relative to subcontracting opportunities under the proposed contract. The offeror shall state that there will be subcontracting, or that the offeror has determined that all work will be done in-house. If there will be subcontracting opportunities under this particular project, then the offeror shall submit a Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan pursuant to FAR 52.219-9. If it is determined there will be no subcontracting opportunities under this particular project, then the offeror shall submit a statement of circumstances supporting that determination. All Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plans and all statements supporting the absence of subcontracting opportunities must be acceptable to the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate an acceptable Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan or a statement supporting the absence of subcontracting opportunities shall render the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.</p>
<p>The Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan must provide breakouts of percentages and dollar values associated with small businesses, disadvantaged business enterprises (DBE), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), historically underutilized small businesses (HUBZone), service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), and minority institutions of higher education (MIHE) as compared to the total amount bid for this effort. The Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan shall be included in the offeror's Volume I proposal.</p>
<p>Note: The FHWA does not have pre-set subcontracting goals. Each proposal is evaluated on a case-by-case basis based upon potential availability of qualified small business concerns. However, offerors should be aware of subcontracting goals legislated under 15 U.S.C. 644(g) that prescribes goals of 3% for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), 5% for Small Disadvantaged Business concerns (SDB), and 5% for Women-Owned Small Business concerns (W)SB). The extent, to which subcontracting opportunities are available to these concerns, as well as other non-minority owned small businesses (SB), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and other minority institutions of higher education, will be considered in the ultimate award decision.</p>
<p>Note: The participation of small businesses, disadvantaged business enterprise firms (DBE), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), historically underutilized small businesses (HUBZone), service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), and minority institutions of higher education (MIHE) is encouraged. Both the Master Subcontracting Plan and the Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan will be considered in the ultimate award decision. See Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award.</p>
<p>Part III - Other Financial / Organizational Information</p>
<p>Provide the following information:</p>
<p>a. Indicate your fiscal year period (provide month to month dates).</p>
<p>b. Indicate whether the proposed indirect cost rate(s) have been audited and accepted by any Federal audit agency. Give name, location, and telephone number of the agency, and the date of acceptance. If no Federal audit has taken place, data supporting the proposed rates over the past three years must accompany the cost proposal. The data shall include a breakdown of the items comprising overhead and G&amp;A, and the base upon which the burdens are computed.</p>
<p>c. Attach a current financial statement, including a balance sheet and income statement for the last completed fiscal year. Specify resources available to perform the contract without assistance from any other source. If sufficient funds are not available, indicate the amount required and the anticipated source (i.e., bank loans, letter or lines of credit, etc.).</p>
<p>d. Standard Form LLL - Submit a completed Standard Form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.</p>
<p>e. Terminated Contracts - List any contract that was terminated for convenience of the Government within the past 3 years, and any contract that was terminated for default within the past 5 years. Briefly explain the circumstances in each instance.</p>

<p>Offerors should use the estimated figures below when preparing their proposal:</p>
<p>L.16 COMMUNICATIONS PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>Offerors shall direct all communications to the attention of the Contracting Officer cited on the face page of this RFP. Communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition, and result in the disqualification of the offeror and/or cancellation of the solicitation.</p>
<p>There are frequently issues that require contact with the offeror. Thus, it is important that you provide a point of contact (POC) together with their e-mail address in your proposal. More than one may be provided.</p>

Academic credentials, professional experience and technical competence to deliver meaningful, successful training in a classroom environment or via web conference or videoconference, in an interactive, engaging manner and accurately respond to in-depth technical questions from course participants, in one or more of the subject areas (Structures, Hydraulics, Geotechnical).</p>
<p>c. An adequate number of highly qualified personnel available to meet the needs of the FHWA. What contingency plans are in place to replace key personnel over the life of the contract without any adverse impact on performance? Instructors certified in adult learning preferred. <br />2. Technical Approach<br />a. Contract objectives, needs, and potential problems are well understood. Technical approach is clear, sound, feasible, innovative, and achievable. Instructional design principles will be incorporated into the development and delivery of NHI Training courses. Proposal includes new ideas for incorporation of modern visualization tools.</p>
<p>b. Ability to clearly describe the objectives, needs, and the manner in which they will be addressed. Does not parrot the RFP language, but rather demonstrates a grasp of what is expected. Demonstrate a solid grasp of the subject area and familiarities with regulatory or programmatic issues that affect development and delivery of instructor-led and distance learning training.<br />3. Past Performance <br />a. The offeror's proposed team has documented recent successful experience related to the applicable task requirements.<br />b. Demonstrated recent successful experience developing final report reports and delivering effective presentations to technical audience in the transportation industry. <br />c. Acceptable degree of successful performance in prior technical service contracts. The Government will evaluate the merits of each offeror's past performance based on its reputation with its former customers including the Government. Evidence can include references, samples of correspondence from satisfied clients, letters of recommendation, etc.</p>
<p>3.1 PAST PERFORMANCE DEFINITIONS AND RATINGS</p>
<p>a. "Relevant experience" involves the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what the solicitation requires. "Somewhat relevant experience" involves the magnitude of effort and complexities including some of what the solicitation requires or is substantially related to. "Not relevant experience" does not involve any significant aspects of what the solicitation requires. A higher degree of relevancy will carry a higher weight when determining past performance ratings.</p>
<p>b. The Government may use information obtained from other sources, and will consider the currency, degree of relevance, source and context of the past performance information. Also, general trends in performance and demonstrated corrective actions will be considered. The Government may also consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel, other corporate entities or subcontractors where such information is relevant to this acquisition. A significant negative finding in any element may result in an overall high-risk rating.</p>
<p>c. Using those references deemed relevant or somewhat relevant together with other information obtained, the FHWA will assess the amount of risk associated with the offeror based on its past performance using the following scale:</p>
<p>Adjectival Color Description<br />Excellent [Very Low Risk] Blue Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their record. <br />Good [Low Risk] Green Little doubt exists based on the offeror's record that they can perform the proposed effort.<br />Adequate [Moderate Risk] Yellow Some doubt exists based on the offeror's record that they can perform the proposed effort.<br />Marginal [High Risk] Orange Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform based on their record.<br />Poor [Very High Risk] Red It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform based on their record.<br />Unknown Grey Little or no relevant record identifiable. No positive or negative evaluation significance.</p>
<p>The Government is not required to interview all points of contact identified by offerors.<br />4. Price</p>
<p>Cost/Price proposals will be evaluated for cost reasonableness and realism in accordance with FAR 15.404. Price will not be numerically scored. The Government will evaluate the proposed individual cost elements (labor rates, indirect rates, etc.) to ensure proposed cost elements are fair, reasonable, and allowable.</p>
<p>NOTE: Under the planned ID/IQ contract(s), prior to award of any Task Order, the Government will evaluate Task Order Price Proposals for cost/price reasonableness and Task Order Price Proposals will be negotiated as necessary.<br /><br />M.3 BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>In addition to the criteria listed above, price will be considered in the award decision. The proposals will be analyzed to assess their price reasonableness. This means that the prices in an offeror's proposal are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal.</p>
<p>The Government will accept the offer that is considered the best value to the Government. A best value analysis will be performed taking into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, cost and past performance analysis, and the perceived ability to perform timely, high quality, consistently reliable support services as provided herein.</p>
<p>In the determination of Best Value, the relative weight given to all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, is more important than price. However, offerors should note that as technical scores approach being essentially equivalent, cost would become more important in the selection decision.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 001 - The sole purpose of this amendment is to answer the following vendor question: <br />
<p>Question: Along with our pricing request from Microsoft regarding your requirement for an Enterprise Agreement renewal, they believed that the 450 client OS licenses should be Pro Desktop, since that is the standard desktop configuration for this enrollment. Microsoft indicated the need to make sure "the requirements are correct and the customer was aware of the issue". I'm not certain if you've been notified of this, but please respond as to what your understanding is of this matter.</p>
<p>Answer: The 450 client OS licenses are for stand-alone laptops that are used to VPN into CFTC users' desktops or to a terminal Server session. These laptops are issued to CFTC Employees and Contractors who already have a desktop which is licensed. The laptops do not require a Pro Desktop license as they are never connected directly to our Microsoft Network.</p>

The evaluation will be based on a complete assessment of each Offeror's proposal.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the Evaluation Factors/Criteria identified above.  It is important that Offerors possess a complete understanding of what each factor requires and accurately interprets their relative order of importance when preparing proposals in response to this solicitation.  The cumulative relative importance of the non-pricing evaluation factors are significantly more important when compared to the pricing factor.<br>  <br>              c. Evaluation Factors are in descending order of importance with the Technical Approach Factor being significantly more important than the  Past Performance Factor , which is more important than the Management Approach Factor.  Subfactors listed under major factors are of equal importance within their respective major factor.<br><br>d.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.   IAW with FAR 15.101-1(2), the evaluation factors other than  price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <br><br>    	e.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br><br>(End of clause)<br><br><br><br>Wage Determination for Schofield Barracks, HI (See Attachment)<br>Wage Determination for Fort Belvoir, VA (See Attachment)<br>Wage Determination for Fort Bragg, NC (See Attachment)<br>Contract Manpower Reporting Clause (See Attachment)<br><br>Clauses may be accessed electronically in full text through http://farsite.hill.af.mil or www.acquisition.gov/far.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

Facility Roof Infrared Survey
 
a.	Contractor to provide 20 aerial infrared photos and CD files of Buildings No. 1, 2, 3, 11, 24 and 29 roofing system.   All infrared2K studies use the following format.

b.	1) Written Overview of the Study itself
 
c.	2) Four up first page, by Building roof shot. All shots are approximately 300' by 300' so small buildings can be combined with larger ones depending upon ICC Operations Mission planning.  This first page features a control daytime photo (JPEG), always in the upper left.  The nighttime Military grade Thermogram, always in the upper right.  The Patent Process IR2K image in the lower Left for easy comparison to the daytime control photo. To complete this 1st page there is a Campus/Building key shot in the lower right with the actual shot framed for reference.

d.	3) The 2nd page is always a Zoomed in shot of the particular roof under examination from the previous 4 up page.  This allows the Building owner to examine their roof in an expanded format.

e.	The balance of the IR2k Roof report then steps through all planned mission shots of your specified Campus rooftops, individually by rooftop, until the entire survey is complete.  This report is delivered to you printed on 130 pound glossy photographic paper, and the same exact same files are also delivered to you upon a CD with full copying/printing rights In summary the Building Owner receives one printed hard copy report and one CD report.

f.	In regard to ICC Option delivery, the rooftop AutoCAD arrives approximately two weeks after the delivery of the hard copy and CD IR2k report.  It will be indexed and sequenced in the exact same manner as the hard Copy reports.  A Building Owner receives both a printed AutoCAD of the individual Rooftop and a CD with the AutoCAD layers with full printing/copying rights.
  
g.	If a Scaled report is ordered for the initial IR2K Study all subsequent ICC Options are then available to a Building owner, i.e., Rooftop AutoCAD, Geo-Spatial Campus mapping into AutoCAD, and X-ref embedding of the rooftop AutoCAD into Geo-Spatial Site Plan AutoCAD.  Scaling is a prerequisite for all of these Options and IC's Scaling is to AIA standards, i.e., for rooftops Scaling is generally between 1" = 20' and 1" = 50' depending upon building size, while for Campus Site Plan AutoCAD the Scale is generally 1" = 100' up to 1" = 150.'

h.	As you know, the Bonham, VA has requested (20) specified JPEG daytime shots of the Bonham, VA Campus.  ICC will provide these for the same price as our Campus mapping into AutoCAD.  We will also provide the daytime JPEG imagery of your Bonham Campus in one large viewable Campus JPEG.  This custom option does NOT include the mapping of the entire Bonham Campus into AutoCAD layers. Additionally, ICC will provide these custom JPEG shots based upon the Bonham VA's specification.  For each planned shot ICC will require; 1) Helicopter Elevation 2) shot direction, such as east shooting to the West 3) the building(s) to be included in each shot, or "Full Campus" to be specified.

i.	MOISTURE IN LOW SLOPE ROOFING AND SCALED CAMPUS SITE-PLAN SURVEY

j.	Infrared Camera must meet or exceed the following specifications: spectral sensitivity with a range from 3-5 microns, focal plan array detector of at least 320 X 240 InSb elements, thermal sensitivity of < 0.10 degrees Celsius.  Infrared Camera Equipment that shall be deemed acceptable for the purposes of this survey shall include; FLIR Corporation's - Ultra 7500, FLIR - MilCAM RECON, FLIR - DS, INDIGO Corporation's Indigo - Merlin, or INDIGO -Phoenix.

k.	Daytime Digital Control imagery and Nighttime Aerial Infrared Thermographic imagery must be taken from a data collection "platform" moving at no more than 10 miles per hour and at an altitude between 500 feet minimum and 700 feet maximum above the structure being surveyed.  Data Capture platform shall move along and above the building's centerline with no more than a 15 degree deviation from vertical on all thermographic imagery.

l.	All thermographic data shall be captured at night and must be digitally computer processed and digitally computer enhanced with false positives removed prior to digital computer analysis for moisture penetration identification of areas as small as 2 square feet.  Further analysis by an Industry Certified Thermograher shall take place following the application of the preceding processes to the raw data.

m.	All processed nighttime thermograms shall be overlaid and/or married upon a daytime photograph of the same building structure to enable accurate registration of the indications of sub-membrane moisture.

n.	Manual/Analog (Hand) transfer of thermographic data to a rectified daytime control image is NOT an acceptable process for the purposes of performing the work noted within this bid specification.  Simple importing of relevant images into a computer or the use of Photoshop to clean smeared data images does not meet the specification of utilizing a software analysis program calibrated to specifically analyze thermographic images in order to identify sub-membrane moisture.  

o.	False Positives shall be removed from the Infrared imagery by utilizing a Moisture Analyst with more than 5 years of experience in the analysis of roof thermographic data for purposes of moisture delineation.

p.	All finished reports must be provided in a 6" X 8" computer processed and analyzed format of each 50,000-60,000 square foot, or less, section.  The locations of thermal anomalies consistent with distinguishing between wet and dry insulation shall be delineated.  All probable areas of moisture must be clearly indicated in shades of red or another color.  The report shall also include daytime photographs of the same structures and an enlarged, fully moisture analyzed infrared image of each roof or roof section.

q.	Two sets of all finished reports shall be provided in each of the following formats: 

Letter-size, loose leaf bound, full color on heavy gloss, 7 mil photographic paper stock, or equivalent.PDF and DWG files saved on a Compact Disc.

r.	 All processed imagery shall be scaled in accordance with industry standard practices, such as 1" = 50'-0", or less.  Roofs larger than 60,000 square feet shall be sectioned into report areas of less than 60,000 square feet with the maximum allowable deviation on all scaled imagery of less than 2%.  It is the contractor's responsibility to secure all building dimensions upon which report scaling will be conducted.  

s.	A North indicator and key shall be included on each processed image.  
All final reporting must meet or exceed ASTM guideline C1153-99 (American Society for Testing & Materials: Standard Practice for Location of Wet Insulation in Roofing Systems using Infrared Imaging).

t.	AutoCAD reports shall be provided on all surveyed rooftops in DWG file format.  Separate AutoCAD layers for the rooftop information shall include the following: all anomalous moisture intrusions; vents, ducts, pipes, HVAC units, and other identifiable planned penetrations of the roof-top.  A separate AutoCAD file shall be provided for each rooftop greater than 60,000 square feet and/or divided into multiple reports.  Each AutoCAD report must include an analysis of the total square feet of each rooftop, the square feet of anomalies, and the percentage of anomalies in the report section.

u.	Scaled campus site plan surveys that clearly and accurately define the spatial AutoCAD layers and colors.  Plans shall be provided in the DWG file format and saved on a CD which also includes the imagery taken of each campus.  Building Owner shall have the unrestricted right and ability to produce unlimited quantities of prints or images from each scaled campus site plan.  The maximum allowable deviation on all scaled imagery shall be less than 2%.

v.	All reports and imagery must be delivered and explained to Building Owner staff by an experienced representative at a campus location to be specified.  ICC's representative shall be available to the Building Owner staff for up to two (2) hours in order to perform the training session explaining the thermographic IR2K images, while presenting a strategy, and answering any related Survey questions. 

w.	The survey will be conducted within 30 days of the receipt of the notice to proceed by contractor.  The survey will be completed within 60 days from the notice to proceed.

<DESC>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/MARKET RESEARCH, W31P4Q-MARKET-RESEARCH, IS HEREBY MODIFIED TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DATE AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN (14) DAYS FROM 18 MARCH 2011 TO 01 APRIL 2011. THERE ARE NO OTHER CHANGES TO THE MARKET RESEARCH.<br><br>The Product Manager, Command Post Systems and Integration (CPS&I), at Redstone Arsenal, AL, is researching technologies to constitute a Company Command Post System (CCPS).  The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for quote (RFQ), request for proposal (RFP), an invitation for bid (IFB) or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service.  There shall be no basis for claims against the government as a result of information submitted in response to the sources sought announcement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for any information submitted by respondents to this request. This notice is for market research purposes only and is not indicative of a full requirement.  Should a full requirement arise, the full requirement will be detailed in the solicitation, if issued.<br><br>The principle goal of this effort is to identify potential technologies and solutions for a CCPS conceptually consisting of a Commander's vehicle and Command Post (CP) support trailer.  This is research only and no draft performance specification has been developed; however, the system concept, comprising of a vehicle and trailer, expects the vehicle and trailer to operate together and independently.<br><br><br>Operations Concept<br>	a.  The Company Command Post (CP) for maneuver, fires, and engineer companies in Infantry, Heavy, and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) facilitates the fusion of maneuver, intelligence, and fires information.  The CP provides the Company Commander effective situational awareness (SA), allowing him to better plan and execute operations, understand the current situation and effectively visualize, describe, and direct subordinates.  The CP conducts point-to-point voice communications and sends and receives data, imagery, and geospatial information that updates the common operational picture.  The ability to send and receive maneuver, fires, intelligence, and sustainment voice and data to both higher headquarters and subordinates is critical to the Company's ability to conduct full spectrum operations over extended distances.<br><br>	b.  Company missions are categorized using a 3-Tiered operational concept.  The commander must have support from a CP element in all Tiers.  The 3-Tiered concept describes capabilities available across a series of Mission, Enemy, Terrain and Weather, Time, Troops Available and Civilian (METT-TC) conditions ranging from the most austere conditions, Tier 1, to the most robust conditions, Tier 3.  It is important to note that a unit may have elements operating in more than one tier at a time, adding additional challenges to mission command capabilities.  The conditions for the 3-Tiered operational concept are:<br><br>		(1)  Tier 1 - Dismounted Operations in Complex, Restrictive Terrain:  For operations in these conditions, the company command group is forward and consists of the Company Commander, the Company Fire Support Officer (FSO), additional headquarters personnel required by the commander, and any mission command capabilities they carry on their backs.  These capabilities include line of sight (LOS) and beyond line of sight (BLOS) voice communications and limited bandwidth data communications (e.g. Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Army Navy/Portable Radio Communications (AN/PRC) 117G, Global Rapid Response Information Package (GRRIP), Nett Warrior (NW), Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) Handheld (HH).  The FSO will have fires software applications and voice and digital communications to execute Army and Joint fires.  Bandwidth limitations will degrade the functional capabilities of the intelligence analyst.   Size, weight and power (SWaP) are significant constraints for Tier 1, limiting the ability to employ CP assets forward.  Tier 1 operations are typically short in duration and mission command capabilities begin to improve as more robust systems are brought forward.<br><br>		(2)  Tier 2 - Operations Supported with Wheeled, Armored, or Mechanized Forces:  For operations in these conditions, the Company Commander's tactical vehicle and the supporting fire support team (FIST) vehicle can move forward to the dismounted unit location to add more robust capabilities to those available in Tier 1.  The Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) Company Commander will not normally fight from his vehicle but will use it for battlefield circulation and as an enabler for designated CP personnel to use the increased network capabilities (e.g. Soldier Network Extension (SNE), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) on the vehicle to support mission command systems (e.g. Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) and Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A)).  Heavy, Stryker, Fires, and Engineer Company Commanders have the option of fighting from their tactical vehicles and take advantage of the organic BLOS and LOS network capabilities.  Later in Tier 2, CP assets that can be transported by wheeled assets or helicopter sling load can be emplaced in remote combat outposts.  SWaP considerations, while not as austere as in Tier 1, remain for the CP assets.  The company must be prepared to logistically support CP operations.<br><br>                (3)  Tier 3 - Operations from a Secure Forward Operating Base (FOB):  For operations in these conditions, all of the previous capabilities remain but the Company CP may take advantage of a more robust and fixed infrastructure if emplaced on a combat outpost or FOB.  The company may choose to off load systems from the tactical CP platform, or trailer, into an outpost/FOB infrastructure that includes hard buildings, electrical outlets, more generators and large fixed communications antennas.  While Tier 3 conditions allow the greatest relief from SWaP constraints, the company CP could be forward deployed into Tier 1 or Tier 2 conditions at any time.<br><br><br>Company Command Post System Concept:<br><br>The Company Command Post System is defined to include the ability to operate On-The-Move (OTM), At-The-Quick-Halt (ATQH) and At-The-Halt (ATH).  The system components are defined to consist of a Commander's vehicle and a trailer mounted Command Post System.  The Commander's vehicle must operate as a standalone OTM, ATQH and ATH.  The trailer mounted Command Post System operates ATH as a standalone system.  The vehicle is defined as a Mine Resistant Ambush Protect (MRAP) - All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) and the trailer mounted system must be towable by the Commander's vehicle.  Both system components are expected to be packaged/mounted as a rugged system component and physically transportable via air, rail and ship.  <br><br>Commander's Vehicle:<br><br> 	Capable of supporting voice and data operations via terrestrial and celestial communications means.<br> 	Capable of supporting military software systems deemed appropriate at the Company level.<br> 	Capable of supporting a Local Area Network.<br> 	Capable of supporting a dismounted Company Commander. <br> 	Capable of shared operations with the trailer mounted system.<br> 	Capable of communications Beyond Line-of-Sight operations from the trailer mounted system.<br> 	Capable of interoperating with existing Army Command Post Platforms (CPP) and other Tactical Operations Center (TOC) assets currently fielded by the US Army.<br> 	Operated, stowed, and transported in a tactical environment subject to extreme climate conditions.<br> 	System power is assumed provided by the vehicle while separated from the trailer mounted system and while OTM and ATQH.<br><br><br>Trailer Mounted Command Post System (TMCPS):<br> 	Capable of supporting voice and data operations via terrestrial and celestial communications means.<br> 	Capable of supporting military software systems deemed appropriate at the Company level.<br> 	Capable of supporting a Local Area Network.<br> 	Capable of providing environmental protection to staff and equipment.<br> 	Capable of shared operations with the Commander's vehicular system.<br> 	Capable of communications Beyond Line-of-Sight operations from the Commander's vehicular system.<br> 	Capable of interoperating with existing Army Command Post Platforms (CPP) and other TOC assets currently fielded by the US Army.  <br> 	Operated, stowed, and transported in a tactical environment subject to extreme climate conditions.<br> 	System power is assumed provided by the trailer mounted system for Company Command Post operations while ATH.  <br><br><br>Technology Information Desired:<br> 	Technologies are sought to facilitate collaborative staff functions in a tactical environment.<br> 	Technologies are sought to save power.<br> 	Technologies are sought to improve mobility and capabilities of a command post.<br> 	Technologies are sought that are simple to use with minimal training.<br> 	Technologies are sought to minimize or eliminate the number of specialized staff required at a command post.<br> 	Technologies must be compatible with JTRS waveforms and (Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 2.<br> 	Technologies must be a Non-Developmental Item (NDI).<br> 	No special tools should be required for assembly/disassembly. <br>Vendor responses will assist the Government in determining a potential future performance specification by providing information about the technical capabilities of available commercial/industrial non-developmental systems and components.  <br><br>Sources Sought Instructions: A written response, not to exceed five (5) pages, with detailed information is requested of those suppliers who can provide components, systems or sub-systems to permit the Government to determine the feasibility of developing a Company Command Post System performance specification or similar specifications.  Detailed information shall include the vendor's capability of providing the required goods and current commercial availability.  Please provide name of the business, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.<br>Please provide any Vendor CAGE Code and the NAICS Code representing a vendor's system or component.  All interested parties should identify if they are a small or large business.  <br>

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THE RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE OF THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, WHICH IS 15 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.	

The Blood Diseases and Resources Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking potential sources to perform as the central laboratory for the program entitled Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study  III (REDS-III). The applicable NAICS code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees. It is anticipated that one award will be made in January 2011 for a period of seven years. 
The objectives of the REDS-III program are to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. 

NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center, one central laboratory, up to four domestic hubs, and up to 4 international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE CENTRAL LABORATORY ONLY
The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: 1) donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The goal of this highly structured, multi-center, donor-recipient epidemiology, laboratory, and clinical outcomes program is to advance public health by conducting critical research to improve transfusion practices and the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in the U.S. and in countries affected by the AIDS epidemic.  The program will include large survey, epidemiological and laboratory investigations. Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program. The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions which need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  It is expected that about one third of the studies conducted in the REDS-III Domestic program will address donor and/or donation safety and availability issues, and other blood banking questions; and that about two thirds of the investigations will address adult transfusion recipient safety concerns.  Most studies performed in the international setting, however, are expected to address blood banking concerns including donor and/or donation safety and availability issues although a small number of studies might address transfusion recipient safety concerns. Comprehensive databases including information on donors and their donations/components (required for the Domestic and International programs), and on adult patients considered for, or receiving a transfusion (required for the Domestic program only) will enable study investigators with the necessary scientific and analytical expertise to address in a timely fashion, important scientific issues in blood banking and transfusion medicine.
The domestic hubs and the international programs will be supported by a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support.  The domestic hubs and the international programs shall also be supported by a central laboratory, which will be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  
The Central Laboratory of the REDS-III Program shall be responsible for: 1) providing technical laboratory expertise and serving as an active participant in developing and prioritizing all REDS-III domestic and international research activities; 2) proposing, developing, and conducting laboratory-based research studies; 3) performing infectious disease, genetic, molecular, immunological, hematological or other processing and testing of biospecimens from all domestic hubs and international sites participating in RED-III epidemiological and laboratory studies according to protocol; 4) arranging and managing subcontracts with other laboratory testing facilities, as appropriate; and 5) serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

Work will potentially occur throughout the Pacific West Region and Intermountain Region. The two regions encompass the states of Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Montana, Wyoming Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. This area contains nearly 150 sites that serve approximately 100 million visitors annually.  The parks of these regions contain thousands of historic structures and archeological sites, hundreds of miles of historic trails, bike paths, riverfront, numerous statues, memorials, historic forts, and battlefields. Despite ongoing repair and maintenance, the road systems in these regions continue to deteriorate. 
In some cases, recommendations for road and trail treatments may have been developed.  Work may include validating those recommendations and submitting alternate design recommendations when characteristics of materials, project conditions, weather, test results or other circumstances warrant adjustments. 
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT:  NPS is exploring the possibility of soliciting and awarding several multiple year construction IDIQ contract(s) to satisfy this need and is trying to determine the contractor interest, availability, and expertise for this type of requirement.  Other agencies within the Department of Interior, the Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Forest Service may be authorized to order from these contracts.  This IDIQ contract will consist of (1) one base year and (4) four one-year option periods.  The guaranteed minimum amount for each contract awarded will be $25,000.00.  The estimated maximum amount will be refined with market research.  It is currently anticipated that the ceiling of each IDIQ contract is anticipated to be $40-50 million for the life of the contract which includes the base and option years combined.  Individual projects are anticipated to be valued at approximately $5,000 to15 million, but may be outside of this range.  Contract values are subject to change based upon the responses received to this announcement and further market research. Payment and performance bonds will be required for each project.
The NPS is considering separating the work based upon the below geographic areas.

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain an indication of interest among business concerns in Minnesota and other states, and obtain capability information of those interested sources. There has been no determination by the Government in regards to the method of procurement for this requirement.

<DESC>The Healthcare Acquisition Activity-North intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price, sole source award to Phillips Electronics N.A.  for their Intellivue Smart Hopping Wireless System at the Ireland Army Community Hospital, 289 Ireland Avenue; Fort Knox, KY 40121.

Currently, Ireland Army Community Hospital is using existing Philips hardware and software at its 2B and PACU Department. This vendor is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only source that can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources (e.g., unique features, function of the item, direct replacement parts/components for existing equipment, patent, copyright, and proprietary data). The new Intellivue Smart Hopping Wireless System  will allow staff to view past captured data that might otherwise be lost in transfer. The Phillips Intellivue Smart Hopping Wireless System will work simultaniously with  the older phillips propietary system.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 423450 and the size standard is 100 Employees. All responsible sources may submit a response. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement will be based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A solicitation will not be issued. Interested firms may identify their interest in writing to the Government point of contact. Responses to this notice must be received no later than 11:00 AM 22 March 2011.

<p>This is a labor hour type contract since it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs&nbsp;with any reasonable degree of confidence, the use of a labor hour contract is appropriate.&nbsp;Therefore, a labor hour contract type, for which the rates are fixed, is the best solution considering the circumstances noted above because the only variable is the number of hours per labor category ( the rates are fixed and include indirect costs).</p>

<DESC>1. Purpose:
A facilitated exercise in Leading Change: Scenario involves participants acting as the newly hired VP Patient Services for Lakeview Regional Hospital.  Lakeview has recently received bad press highlighting long wait times in the ER.  Youve been asked by the Hospitals CEO to lead a team to reduce wait times in the ER. Learning points:

	Learn Change Management best practices (7-step model for managing change, key change management tactics, creating a common language for change). 
	Learn about Lean Practices
	Learn from, and connect with, other colleagues in the room

2. Justification for sole-source: 

Leading Change is the dominant theme of the signature courses in the Center for Executive Education.
 The core presentations all deal with developing and maturing management skills. The culmination is an exercise which brings together virtually all the course presentations and learning objectives. The simulation from Experience Point has proven over the years to be the most successful tool to reflect and practice how to be Change Agents.  

After conducting market research, it was concluded that no other simulation software can provide a comparable learning experience for students as it relates to the course materials and learning objectives.  The software is a simulation training that is specific to the class and curriculum.  The simulation exercise ties together the course presentations and learning objectives.
  There are no comparable simulations on the market that will tie in with the class curriculum and meet the desired learning objectives of the courses in the Center for Executive Education.   

Additionally, ExperiencePoint is a recognized global leader in leadership simulations.  ExperiencePoint works with many of the top Executive Education programs in the world (Duke, London Business School, UNC, Ashridge, HEC Paris, Mt. Eliza - Melbourne, Rotman - U of Toronto, etc.).  ExperiencePoint has worked with other federal government agencies, to include: Defense Acquisition University (US-SOCOM, Naval CIS, and Strategic Change Management Center), USAF, and the US Marines.

<DESC>FEMA intends to enter into a sole-source Blanket Ordering Agreement with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 699 Prince Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3175.<br /><br />- Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's need:
<p>The contractor shall provide reunification services for children displaced during a presidentially declared disaster or emergency</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Estimated value of the acquisition: Not-to-exceed&nbsp;amount for a one year ordering period&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Authority for acquiring the supplies or services on other than a full and open competitive basis. (Check applicable exception and provide a justification to include a demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited below the selection.)</p>
<p>[X] Authority is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />Justification:</p>
<p>6 U.S.C. &sect; 774(c) states, in relevant part, "the Administrator, in coordination with the Attorney General of the United States, shall establish within the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children [NCMEC] the National Emergency Child Locator Center" See also 6 U.S.C. &sect; 775. Under the statute, FEMA must obtain these services from NCMEC. Nevertheless, this justification does not use FAR 6.302-5 (authorized or required by statute) because such an award nevertheless fails to meet the requirements of 41 U.S.C. &sect; 253(i) or the FAR, in that the Homeland Security Act does not refer to the statutory exception, and fails to state that "award...is required by such provision of law in contravention of" merit-based selection procedures. Hence, despite the mandatory nature of the award, the statutory exception to CICA's competition requirements does not apply.</p>
<p>- Additional supporting facts for the acquisition:</p>
<p>a. If only one source is the basis for the J&amp;A, explain why technical data packages, statements of work or purchase descriptions suitable to maximize competition to the maximum extent practicable have not been developed or are not available.</p>
<p>The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) specifically, Sections 689b and 689c, codified at 6 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 774 &amp; 775, designated NCMEC as the lead for facilitating the expeditious identification of children and reunification of families. No additional document, to include SOWs or purchase descriptions are suitable to maximize competition are not available due to the above-referenced act.</p>
<p>- Actions taken for removal of barriers to competition.</p>
<p>NCMEC is the only source able to satisfy the requirement no further action will be taken.</p>
<p>PART II</p>
<p>1. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable and listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. This requirement will be synopsized. No other potential sources have expressed an interest.</p>
<p>2. Market Research. &#9633; Additional or XX no additional market research was conducted to determine potential sources because/or the results were:</p>
<p>In accordance with The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) specifically, Sections 689b and 689c, codified at 6 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 774 &amp; 775 NCMEC has been designated as the agency in which FEMA will partner with for this type of requirement. No additional research required</p>
