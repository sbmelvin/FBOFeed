<DESC>Feb 2011<br />MEMORANDUM FOR: ALL RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTRACTORS AND INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS<br />FROM: Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency<br />SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) for Air Force Renewable Energy Programs involving proven Small Scale Wind Generation (under 500KW) and Wind Distributed Renewable Generation Energy Technologies.<br />Description<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes. The Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency is seeking cost and capability information from interested parties concerning the matters described below for application at bases across the Air Force.<br />Purpose<br />The purpose of this Small Scale Wind Generation and Distributed Generation RFI is twofold: first to identify market viable partnership concepts, from strategies to specific projects, to create and grow long-term public-private partnerships to develop renewable energy projects on Air Force installations in the continental United States, Hawaii and Alaska; and second, to identify qualified private sector developers, utilities, and/or like development entities with an interest in developing renewable energy projects on Air Force land. The objectives of this RFI are derived from a broad set of Air Force energy goals and operational cost savings mandates. They include, but are not limited to:<br />&#61607; Reduce Demand: The Air Force is committed to reducing installation energy demand. <br />&#61607; Increase Supply: The Air Force is committed to increasing energy supplies, utilizing renewable and alternative energy where possible, to enhance energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Air Force goal is that 25% of all facility energy be from renewable sources by Fiscal Year 2025.<br />&#61607; Cost Avoidance: The Air Force is mandated to reduce or eliminate operations costs for the repair, replacement, and/or investment in energy generation infrastructure.<br />&#61607; Revenue Generation: Air Force asset management strategy seeks to optimize non-excess assets through the development of renewable energy projects, where mutually beneficial to the Air Force, external installation community, and private developers.<br />The mechanisms to implement public-private partnerships utilized by the Air Force to achieve these objectives can take many forms. Development concepts can include, but are not limited to:<br />&#61607; Renewable Energy Power Purchase Agreement (REPPA). Under the authority of 10 USC 2304 and 40 USC 113(e)(3), the Air Force purchases power from on-base renewable energy generation projects. Project size is determined by installation demand. The Air Force is the power offtaker. Solicitation is accomplished via a Request for Proposal (RFP).
<p>&#61607; Enhanced Use Lease (EUL). Under the authority of 10 USC &sect; 2667, the Air Force leases land to a developer, utility, or other entity to develop a renewable energy project on an installation for which the market is the power offtaker. Project size is determined by market demand and installation renewable resources, possibly augmented by surrounding community resources. Solicitation is accomplished via a Request for Qualifications (RFQ).</p>
<p>&#61607; EUL/PPA Combination. This project type is in a concept development phase at this time. An EUL/PPA maximizes the market potential of an EUL with the benefit of the Air Force being a limited offtaker of the power produced via a power purchase agreement. Each vehicle is mandated under separate authority as listed above under EUL and PPA respectively. Solicitation process to be determined.</p>
<p>&#61607; Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC). Under the authority of 10 CFR 436 Subpart B, the Air Force may enter into shared-energy savings contracts with private-sector energy service companies (ESCOs) to increase the energy efficiency at a facility. The ESCO designs and constructs a project that meets the agency's needs and arranges the necessary financing. The ESCO guarantees that the improvements will generate energy cost savings sufficient to pay for the project over the term of the contract. ESCO funded improvements are paid through a share of the savings resulting from the energy efficiency. Solicitation is accomplished via a RFP.</p>
<p>&#61607; Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC). Under the authority of 10 USC Section 2913, the Air Force participates in utility energy efficiency programs. In a UESC, a utility arranges financing to cover the capital costs of the project, which are repaid over the contract term from cost savings generated by the energy efficiency measures. Solicitation is accomplished via a RFP.</p>
<p>&#61607; Other. The Air Force is open to any new and innovative strategies and project concepts which can help the Air Force to meet its energy goals and operational cost savings mandates. <br />Based on the Air Force's energy goals and objectives, and its unique non-excess asset portfolio in or adjacent to markets with significant renewable energy development and or potential, we believe there is a unique opportunity for market makers to partner with the Air Force to create value for all--a win-win business proposition.<br />Industry Engagement <br />This interaction with Industry organizations has been initiated following the Air Force Renewable Energy Industry Day held in Irving, TX on 8 December 2010. A series of RFIs will be issued to gain additional specific input focused on separate areas of the renewable energy spectrum. This RFI is focused on smaller wind generation with sizes below 500Kw and the concepts of distributed generation. With distributed generation, the energy produced would first be used in the host building or area. Responses on these topics may be presented in combination or in separate concepts. <br />Future RFIs, covering different focus areas, will be posted to FedBizOpps.gov periodically to allow control of the RFI review and evaluation workload. General planning is to move through Focus Areas in the following order, subject to adjustment and change. <br />Geothermal<br />Small Solar (&lt;750 kW)<br />Large Wind (&gt;500 kW)<br />Woody Biomass<br />Large Solar (&gt;750 kW)<br />WTE with Municipal Solid Waste<br />Concepts and Proposals<br />Please include in your response to this Request for Information, detailed responses to the following areas:<br />a. A written summary of your ideas, inputs and development concept. Specify the technology or technologies which you specialize in with an explanation of the relationship and relevance to use of a renewable resource to provide energy benefit to the Air Force and the costs of implementing those technologies in the areas of Small Scale Wind Generation and Wind Distributed Generation. Please tailor your estimate of cost and benefits in comparison to commercially available industry level energy costs in the locations suggested. Your ideas and suggestions will be reviewed and evaluated for technical readiness, potential benefit, and incorporation into Air Force-wide strategy, and may be utilized to develop future RFPs, RFQs and/or initiatives towards expanded use of renewable energy. Proprietary or business confidential material should be clearly identified and will be handled appropriately by all Air Force offices.</p>
<p>b. Under this RFI or under future issuances, the Air Force may terminate or continue to pursue this effort.</p>
<p>c. The Air Force expects to use consultants to assist it with its review of all responses received. Please be advised that data submitted to the Government in response to this RFI may be released to non-government advisors employed by the government for review and analysis of the submissions.

Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. <br /><br />The Government may use the services of JAG Technologies in an advisory role in the technical evaluation of white papers and/or proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm who review the white papers and/or proposals will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. If the offeror desires the cited firm be excluded from access to information contained in its white paper and/or proposal, offeror must so indicate in a letter of transmittal accompanying the document.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility and or network resources to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Aerial Ground Surveillance Systems Division is conducting market research to seek qualified sources for the potential development, production, and sustainment of an airborne radar system for the time period starting in Fiscal Year (FY) 11.  The Air Force desires this to be an Open System Architecture radar system and is interested in obtaining information on activities related to this concept.  The current approach states the radar system will be externally integrated (i.e. podded) onto the Block V variant of the MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and have the capability to find, fix, and track vehicles and to identify, track, and discriminate dismounts and be able to interface with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS).  The contractor must have the capability!  to develop, manufacture, and sustain the radar system, subsystems, components, software, ground support equipment, communication equipment and spare parts including performing testing and deployment, and provide Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) both in the continental United States and outside the continental United States.

These capabilities are for use by USAF forces employed in operations worldwide. This Capability Request for Information (CRFI) will support requirements generation and refinement, Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) document development, and potential inputs to the Air Force Program Objective Memorandum process and the USAF Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Flight Plan</p>
<p>This request for information is for planning purposes only. In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research. This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only. Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to pay for the information you provide. Your responses will be treated as information only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this CRFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary". Data submitted in response to this CRFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government. It is the responsibility of Respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. Respondents are further advised that the government's analyses of your responses may require disclosure of your responses to Advisory and Assistance Services support contractor personnel. All members of the government/contractor team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the support contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information</p>
<p>APPROACH: This CRFI is being issued to identify and examine technologies and potential system solutions available to provide Analysis, Correlation and Fusion capabilities to the USAF in the near- and/or mid-term (current and next Fiscal Year Defense Plans). These capabilities are for use by USAF forces employed during operations in a wide range of environmental conditions. USAF is interested in Analysis, Correlation and Fusion material solution concepts for potential fielding that are applicable to the following generic areas:</p>
<p>- Accessing, Fusing and using data across Security Domains in support of analysis</p>
<p>- Correlating Data from Multiple Sources/Domains to support Combat Identification</p>
<p>- Automated and semi-automated development of Intelligence preparation of the Operational Environment decision aids and local databases</p>
<p>- Developing a Fused, Unambiguous, Correlated Electronic order of Battle that's Updated every 12 hours</p>
<p>- Tailored Intelligence to Support the Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming Database</p>
<p>- Ability to Assess Integrated Air Defense Systems</p>
<p>- Fusion Tools to Support Predictive Battlespace Awareness</p>
<p>- Providing Joint/Coalition Forces with Timely, Fused Intelligence from Distributed Common Ground Station</p>
<p>- Implement of common data formats necessary to make all Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance generated data, making it Discoverable and accessible</p>
<p>- Current Threat Signature Resources to Satisfy Demands from Warfighters, Sensor/Weapon System Acquisition and R&amp;D Consumers</p>
<p>- Integrating Raw/Exploited Imagery and Textual Reports with the Common Operation Picture</p>
<p>Respondents are encouraged to provide responses that are applicable to individual or multiples of the above listed focus areas. It is left to the respondents' discretion whether to provide a response involving existing (fielded or "ready" to field), new (in development or conceptual), or a combination of each. The goal of this CRFI is to identify new or existing technology concepts that can address emerging operational needs and provide the desired capability and capacity. Wherever possible and practical, the utilization of open, digital, modular, scalable, sustainable and common architectures is encouraged to enable such technology to be used on multiple aircraft types and with multiple system interfaces.<br />The capability needs to be addressed by this CRFI are in some cases challenging. The Air Force is looking to industry to identify solution concepts that address the full range of these in an incremental manner. Therefore, companies that have partial solution concepts are encouraged to respond and address the extent to which their concepts provide answers to the challenges presented by this CRFI. This feedback provides the Air Force with insights into what is readily available and what the Technology Readiness Levels are for concepts which can meet these challenges. It also provides an indication of what operational needs are most susceptible to costs and technical performance factors</p>

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI): The Electronic Systems Center, Division for Integration and Intelligence (ESC/XR2) Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts is seeking technical information on current and emerging research and development related to processes in the targeting core competency for Air Force intelligence.</p>
<p>Information Papers: Industry product developers are requested to provide the ESC/XR2 a completed survey for each targeting related industry capability. The survey is attached and posted on either FedBizOps or HERBB under this RFI. In addition to the survey, a quad chart (sample attached) for each capability is requested. RFI responses should also include: 1) name of the primary point of contact for the response; 2) academic faculty or business title; 3) institution or organization affiliation; 4) e-mail address; 5) phone; and 6) identification of other key individuals who collaborated on the RFI response.<br /><br />Surveys and quad charts are requested to be submitted no later than 11 Mar 2011. Surveys and quad charts will be reviewed on the basis of technical efficacy and relevance to the targeting process (see attachment para 3) by military personnel and government civilians. The surveys and quad charts may be forwarded to other Government entities in consideration for applicability to other programs.</p>
<p>Background: <br />Targeting problems continue to plague the Air Force and the Joint Community. Although we have made tremendous strides in the Air Force with the stand-up of the Air Force Targeting Center, much work remains. The Air Force Greybeard Targeting Study in 2008 concluded that targeting concerns are of such a magnitude that they put the Air Force's ability to conduct operations and employ precision munitions at risk. More recently, significant gaps in targeting were identified to the 2010 ISR Flight Plan Needs Panel by a variety of MAJCOMs.</p>
<p>The importance of targeting to the Air Force cannot be overstated. Air Force Doctrine Document 2-1.9, Targeting, states that targeting "will always be central to the way the Air Force conducts operations." As warfare has become more complex, so has the targeting problem. This problem is exacerbated by:</p>
<p>&bull; A huge increase in dynamic targeting in support of on-going Global War on Terrorism combat operations<br />&bull; A large and growing inventory of coordinate-seeking weapons <br />&bull; A growing number of smaller yield weapons which require more detailed targeting data to achieve the desired effects<br />&bull; Today, Air Force Intelligence is less capable of influencing weapon system acquisition and the intelligence support those systems require than it was 15 years ago</p>
<p>There has been much discussion recently as to what exactly the Air Force has in its targeting portfolio. With this in mind, and in accordance with the Air Force Development Planning process, AFMC/A2/5 has initiated a Capabilities Planning and Analysis (CP&amp;A) effort to identify current materiel/non-material solution efforts and how these efforts address the targeting gaps identified via ISR Flight Plan CP&amp;A process.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Notice: This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the ESC/XR2, will take procurement action in this matter. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This is a RFI for the purpose of conducting market research relating to gaps in Air Force targeting processes (see attachment para 3).</p>
<p>This RFI shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government. Further, the Government will NOT be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess alternatives available for the potential requirement. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Confidentiality: Please provide only unclassified responses to this RFI to Mr. Jay Vaughn, Jay.Vaughn@HANSCOM.AF.MIL. Respondents must indicate whether their information paper responses contain proprietary information if the respondents wish for the responses to be handled as such.</p>
<p>Responses/Inquiries: Direct questions and information papers in response to this Request For Information (RFI) to:<br />Mr. Jay Vaughn <br />781-377-7821<br />Jay.Vaughn@HANSCOM.AF.MIL</p>

<a href="mailto:michael.sampson8@us.army.mil">CECOM Contracting Center (CECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>C4ISR Mission Command Common Computing Platform, Family of Market Survey Questionnaire<BR><BR>The Army's modernization effort of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) has introduced a multitude of new and improved Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) equipments that will enhance the soldier's ability to plan, monitor, communicate and execute the mission.  Each C4ISR system designed their own unique hardware to meet its stated operational requirement / mission.  Installation of these C4ISR systems into command and control vehicles has become difficult due to space restrictions.  Multiple Processors, Displays, Input/Output devices and installations kits within a command vehicle has reached the saturation point.  The Size, Weight, Power and overall Cost (SWAP-C) involved with duplication of computing hardware for all these C4ISR systems is a major concern.  <BR><BR>To alleviate these concerns, the Government intends to procure a common computing system that will be shared by multiple C4ISR programs / applications.  The objective of this Request For Information (RFI) is to canvas industry to obtain feedback regarding the Government's requirement for a C4ISR Mission Command Common Computing Platform (MC3P).   It cannot be overstated that the government is looking for a low cost common computing system that will address the MC3P requirements.  The MC3P can be a combination of one or more computers /components making up the system to address the increasing levels of computing complexity.  This can then logically translate to a family of computers sharing the same common baseline. <BR><BR>The Government envisions a Family of MC3P computers; initial notional thoughts are there will be three capability levels of computers: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.  All three MC3P computer variants' would support the initial realization of the Mounted Computing Environment as well as be communications/transport agnostic.  The relative quantities or percentages of Basic, Intermediate and Advanced computer systems are on the order of 80%, 15%, and 5% respectively.  Initial fielding quantities are for 3 BCT's.  It is not the Government's intention to replace all fielded FBCB2 JV-5 computers with MC3P's but instead to enhance the BCT's for mission specific requirements detailed below.  Additionally it should be noted that any resulting contract vehicle for the MC3P may be used to fulfill the follow-on computer requirements for PM FBCB2 either JBC-P or re-fresh. Requirements or capabilities for the three variants are described below. <BR><BR>1. The family of computing and display hardware must provide general purpose computing resources in both a mounted and dismounted configuration to host, execute, and meet the hardware requirements of one or more software applications and/or application suites running simultaneously that will provide a variety of capabilities. The family of computing hardware will host capabilities including, but not limited to:<BR><BR>a. Situational Awareness / C2 / Battle Command - including current applications like JBC-P, TIGR, CPOF, MTS (or JBC-P Log), AFATDS/FOS, and DCGS-A (analyst workstation); and future applications to be developed.  <BR><BR>b. Sensor data processing and display including display of current combat platform sensor feeds such as driver's viewers, 360 degree situation awareness cameras, shot detection systems such as Boomerang, the LRAS3, CLOE, CBRN sensors, Mounted Soldier System (MSS) Helmet Mounted Display and combat vehicle mounted FLIR sensors.  The capability will include reduction of GPS devices on vehicles, north seeking modules or Inertial Navigation Systems for the purpose of internal processing or distribution to other on board systems. The capability must allow growth for additional sensors yet to be developed.<BR><BR>c. On-board Platform Network Management - including control of combat net radios, routing of data between terrestrial and SATCOM radios (e.g. BFT 2 & WIN-T PoP/SNE), network monitoring, enterprise services integration (e.g. AD, PKI, Radius, HBSS), cross-banding between two different networks, MSS cordless communications and SWAP/space-claim deconfliction (e.g., the proposed system must be capable of routing multiple voice formats (analog, serial, VoIP).<BR><BR><BR>2. The family of computing and display hardware will host software and/or software applications based on the capabilities required of the leader in accordance with his/her role.   Below are Example categories of the potential capabilities:<BR><BR><BR>a. Basic Capability: Junior NCO leaders - C2/SA mounted platform running JBC-P/MTS/FOS and platform integration of SW, radio controls, one display and user input device, and organic on-board sensors.<BR><BR>b. Intermediate Capability: Junior/mid-grade staff officers and senior NCO leaders - C2/SA with dismountable capability platform running JBC-P and platform integration of SW, radio controls and cross-banding between different networks, multiple security enclaves, network/node management, enterprise services, routing between terrestrial and SATCOM radios, two displays and user input devices for select platforms (one for Infantry dismounts), and organic on-board sensors.<BR><BR>c. Advanced Capability: Commanders and Mnvr S3 leaders -  C2/SA with dismountable capability platform running JBC-P/TIGR/CPOF/DCGS-A (analyst workstation)/ AFATDS and platform integration of SW, multiple security enclaves, network management, enterprise services, radio controls, routing between terrestrial and SATCOM radios, cross-banding between different networks, two displays for Co Cdrs (one for JBC-P and one for CPOF/TIGR) & four displays and user input devices for BCT and Bn Cdrs (one for JBC-P for the TC, and 3 for maneuver, fires and Intel staff), and organic on-board sensors. In addition the capability to receive and view off-board sensor data from UAS or other yet to be determined sensors.<BR><BR>If industry has an alternative capability approach to the above example then suggest it be provided along with basis and rationale.   <BR><BR>3. To the maximum extent possible, the family of computing hardware must allow for the receipt and processing of sensor data from a variety of sensor platforms both on-board and off-board the mobile platforms.  Any cross domain solution necessary to accept sensor data may be implemented internally or externally to the computing hardware itself.  Any external solution would still be considered part of the family of computing hardware.<BR><BR>4. The family of computing hardware will not be expected to host and execute software that is considered real-time and/or safety-critical.<BR><BR>5. To the extent possible the family of computers should look to take full advantage of Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) savings opportunities.  The MC3P computer should comply with the SWAP requirements for the FBCB2 JV5 computer.    <BR><BR>6. To the extent possible and feasible, the family of common computer hardware should be implemented using a modular approach so as to allow flexibility of the hardware to meet the capabilities required of the leader as per his/her role.<BR><BR>7. To the maximum extent possible, the family of computing hardware should be designed to allow for incremental upgrades to increase computing resources (e.g. CPU, RAM, storage) as technologies mature.<BR><BR>8. The family of computing hardware should be designed with reasonable spare computing resources (e.g. CPU, RAM, GPU, storage) to accommodate additional future capabilities without the need to upgrade components.<BR><BR>9. The family of computing hardware must be ready to begin fielding by 1QFY13. An incremental approach may be required to support all use cases.<BR><BR>10. It is the Government's desire for the Basic MC3P hardware system unit production cost goal to be less than $10K in procurement quantities of 10,000 per year.  Total procurement may be as high as 100,000 units worldwide.<BR><BR>11. The MC3P System platform must be capable of operating on Army tactical ground vehicles, tracked and wheeled.  Essentially the MC3P hardware must meet at a minimum the same environmental requirements as the FBCB2 JV5 computer.  This specification is available for review as part of this RFI.<BR><BR>12. The MC3P System Display must have an internal touch screen capability and be fully sunlight readable in bright sunshine, with brightness level that is gradually adjustable from full brightness to total blackout conditions for night time operations.<BR><BR>13. The contractor must provide the US Government with the necessary documentation and Government purpose data rights for the MC3P Family of Computing Hardware equipment sufficient for one or more alternate suppliers to build equipment that will be fully compatible with the MC3P.<BR><BR>14. It is desired that the MC3P architecture be based upon adequately mature commercial technology to enable a short first article prove out cycle and production lead time such that the Government can procure and field this capability beginning in 1QFY13.  Incremental approaches will be evaluated also.<BR><BR>Acronym List:<BR>C2:  Command and Control<BR>SA: Situational Awareness<BR>FBCB2: Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below<BR>JBC-P:  Joint Battle Command - Platform<BR>TIGR: Tactical Ground Reporting<BR>CPOF: Command Post of the Future<BR>MTS: Movement Tracking System<BR>AFATDS/FOS: Advanced Field Artillery Target Designation System / Forward Observer System<BR>DCGS-A: Distributed Common Ground System- Army<BR>LRAS3: Long-Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System<BR>CLOE: Common Logistics Operating Environment<BR>CBRN: Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear<BR>FLIR: Forward Looking Infrared Radar<BR>GPS/PNT: Global Positioning System / Position Navigation & Timing<BR>SATCOM: Satellite Communications<BR>BFT-2:  Blue Force Tracking -2<BR>WIN-T PoP/SNE: Warfighter Information Network, Point of Presence / Solider Network Extension<BR>MSS: Mounted Soldier System<BR>CPU: Central Processing Unit<BR>RAM: Random Access Memory<BR>GPU: Graphics Processing Unit<BR><BR><BR>Vendor Questionnaire<BR><BR>The intent of this questionnaire is to organize vendor responses to this RFI.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 423490, Other Professional Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers.<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is for Gerstel Inc. to provide a robotic system that is used for injecting aliquots for the measurement of compounds in NHANES samples for the trans fatty acid project. Usage of this instrumentation will increase throughput for our laboratory by greater than 100% to assess the U.S. population for the following trans fatty acids: 9-trans hexadecenoic acid (palmitelaidic acid, C16:1 19), 9-trans-octadecenoic acid (eladidic acid C18:1 19), 11-trans-octadecenoic acid (vaccenic acid , C18:1 111), 9-trans-12 trans-octadecadienoic acid (Linolelaidate acid, C18:2 19, 112). Furthermore, using instruments from the same manufacturer would greatly reduce the time necessary to modify a method on a different type of instrument. This would include additional training, method development, and method characterization which could take 1-4 months in revalidating the methods, reprograming software and continuity in instrument sensitivity.<br /><br />Gerstel Inc is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirement because no other vendor could provide this customized autosampling system for the existing GS/MSD system.

<DESC>The subject requirement is for the acquisition of 2 NSNs with various item descriptions and end items being bought to various manufacturer's part numbers as shown further below. The FSC of this requirement is 2510. An Indefinite Quantity Long-Term Contract with a base year and 4 option years is anticipated. The total duration base plus option years shall not exceed 5 years. Solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business. The NAICS code is 336370 and business size standard 500 employees. The solicitation will be available on March 14, 2011 at https://dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. Quantity ranges and delivery schedule will be noted on the RFP. FOB Destination is required. Inspection/Acceptance requirements will be noted on RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote, which shall be considered. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability of providing a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery, and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identify will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement to continue work underthe Laboratory for Atmospheres Scientific and Technical Support Services contract No.NNG06HX18C with Science Systems and Applications, Inc. (SSAI). This contract providesperformance-based support services for Earth atmospheric science research including:Earth system modeling and data assimilation; analysis of satellite and sub-orbitalmeteorological data including atmospheric composition; and education and public outreach.These support services include, but are not limited to: 1) Development, validation anddocumentation of computer codes; 2) Analysis of satellite observations and generation andvalidation of satellite and/or model based climate data sets; and 3) Development,testing, and operation of instrumentation for measurements of atmospheric parameters.NASA intends to award a sole-source contract modification to SSAI pursuant to 10 U.S.C2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center(NASA's GSFC) Earth Sciences Directorate.  GSFC intends to extend the current contractNNG06HX18C with SSAI, Inc. for one year. Extending the period of performance by one yearwill allow for critical milestones to be completed and for continuation of workperformance through April 30, 2012, by which time the follow-on competitive contract isanticipated to be awarded. This extension increases the current maximum ordering value ofthe contract by $6M, from $74M to $80M.  SSAI as the current incumbent has the combined training, experience, and expertise toprovide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical support. The tasks performed underthe contract with SSAI support advanced research in the atmospheric sciences, involve thecollection and sophisticated analysis of atmospheric data, require the complex modelingof atmospheric chemistry and physics, and support the development and application ofcutting-edge technologies.  The necessary expertise and experience is specific and istypically developed after years of working with civil servant principal investigators andproject scientists.  Numerous examples can be cited such as the support needed to processand analyze data from airborne and satellite sensors to retrieve cloud opticalproperties, the services supporting research involving the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble Modeland Cloud Resolving Model, and	support for the development and operation of an UnmannedAirborne Vehicle Radar.  The unique skills supporting such research cannot be readilyreplaced without a learning curve.  Therefore, NASA believes that the incumbentcontractor, SSAI, is the only contractor capable of carrying over the necessary andspecific skills, experience, and expertise until the competitive follow-on contract isawarded.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 PM. local timeon March 10, 2011.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the implementation of supporting structures to carryon-orbit additional payload mass. The support structure kit will have the similar designof the one provided for the Flight Module (FM)-1. The kit will support the installationof twelve (12) Cargo Transfer Bags (CTB) on the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM)Flight Module (FM) aft cone. NASA/JSC intends to contract directly with Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (translated asItalian Space Agency) hereinafter as ASI, for these services on a sole source basis.ASI and NASA entered into an agreement (The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)) on October9, 1997, which states that ASI has design control of the MPLM and has the responsibilityfor maintaining the design configuration. MPLMs are pressurized logistic modules, eachaccommodating storage containers for the purpose of transporting user payload andresupply items in a pressurized environment. These specific terms of the NASA/ASI MOU have the effect of limiting this MPLMmodification to ASI, since ASI is to provide payloads that meet ISS defined standardsunder article 6.2(b) (16) defined in the MOU. Article 6.2(b)(8) also states that ASI isto perform sustaining engineering functions of hardware for the operational lifetime,which is why NASA requires the use of a sole source basis, since ASI maintains allintellectual property rights to the MPLM.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon March 11, 2011.

<DESC><p style="mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to perform a National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drugged Driving. NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>A major component of addressing the impaired driving crash risk question is determining the incidence of drivers on the road with positive blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and/or who have measurable amounts of drugs in their system. Previous research (see below) has been conducted on the incidence of impaired drivers on the road. This research project will provide current data on the incidence of alcohol-positive, and drug-positive, drivers through a national roadside survey.</p>
<p>Four "national roadside surveys" have previously been conducted (1973 , 1986 , 1996 , 2007 ) to obtain data on this issue. In these surveys, drivers were randomly selected from weekend night (and Friday day in the 2007 survey) traffic on representative roadways across the 48 contiguous United States. In the first three surveys, once the driver pulled to the side of the road, s/he was asked to provide a breath sample and to answer a few questions regarding her/his drinking and driving behavior and the current trip. In the 2007 survey, for the first time, drivers were also asked to provide a voluntary oral fluid and blood sample, and to answer questions on drug use.</p>
<p>These studies have provided critical information regarding the prevalence of alcohol-positive drivers on the road across years at various BACs, which we can examine for trends. For example, there have generally been declines in both the prevalence of drivers who are alcohol-positive, and those who are at or above the current legal limit of 0.08 g/dL in each of the surveys. Across thirty years, drivers alcohol-positive drivers on Friday and Saturday nights have decreased from 22.3% to 7.9%, and drivers who had a BAC of .08 or higher decreased from 7.5% to 2.2%.</p>
<p>Although only six years will have elapsed since the last survey in 2007, there is considerable interest in obtaining current data and it is time to conduct another roadside survey, currently planned for 2013. This survey is needed to better determine the extent of alcohol-impaired and drugged driving, to develop and allocate appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is for the study of alcohol- and drugged driving research. <br />At a minimum, the contract covers:</p>
<p>&bull; A national roadside survey(s) to estimate the prevalence of the following on the nation's roads: <br />o drivers at various BACs (blood alcohol concentrations),<br />o drivers with the presence of various (over-the-counter, prescription, and illegal) drugs in their system, and <br />o drivers with alcohol and other drugs in their system.</p>
<p>&bull; The next national roadside survey is currently planned for 2013.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of guidelines to instruct others (e.g., local jurisdictions) how to conduct a representative roadside survey.</p>
<p>&bull; Analyses of alcohol and drug data, including trend and other analyses, using data from this survey and past roadside surveys.</p>
<p>This contract may also require (these are currently optional tasks, and are not funded at this time):</p>
<p>&bull; Planning and preparation for the following national roadside survey.</p>
<p>&bull; Study(ies) related to alcohol- and/or or drug- driving. This may include:<br />o Determination of impairing effects of alcohol or drugs, for example, on driving-related skills,<br />o Problem identification on alcohol- or drugged-drivers, and/or drugs in use in the U.S.,<br />o Detection and/or apprehension of alcohol- and/or drug-positive drivers, for example by law enforcement,<br />o Analysis of impaired driving laws, for example, how they are implemented and/or used, and/or their effectiveness,<br />o Analysis of criminal justice system, for example, how drugged drivers are prosecuted or sanctioned, and/or<br />o Evaluation of alcohol- or drug-related programs, sanctions, or other countermeasures.</p>
<p>Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed eighteen (60) months will be awarded. The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-11-R-00451). The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about March 15, 2011. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>NO FURTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVALABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $19M. <br /><br />Period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.<br /><br />The FACS Core Facility provides flow cytometry and cell sorting support to all the laboratories in the NCI Center for Cancer Research. The FACS Core Facility houses a proprietary special order research project FACS Aria cell sorter S/N P46900083 (BD Biosciences, installed in 2007). In this time, the lab has provided service to investigators from over 35 NCI labs and branches. It is critical that this instrument remain in excellent operating condition at all times. It is also important that the quality of the results from this instrument be kept at a consistently high level. Many experiments, if unable to be run on the sorter as scheduled, cannot be rescued. It is important that the instrument be kept current with proprietary software revisions and product corrective actions. We also depend heavily on qualified telephone troubleshooting and technical assistance from the manufacturer's staff. These assets are available only from BD Biosciences. There are several hundred BD Biosciences flow cytometers and cell sorters on the NIH Bethesda campus. Because of this, BD has at least 8 highly trained and qualified Field Service Representatives in the Washington, DC area. At any given time, several of them will be on the Bethesda campus. This means we have had very fast response times on our service calls. Because the manufacturer trains these Field Service Representatives and because the manufacturer provides frequent updated continuing education for them, instrument problems can be diagnosed and fixed quickly. BD Biosciences also keeps a full inventory of all the parts in their warehouses that can arrive on-site by the following morning to replace items that cannot immediately be repaired and returned to service.<br /><br />Service and preventive maintenance will be provided by Field Service Representatives trained by BD Biosciences. BD Biosciences is the manufacturer of the FACS Aria. The manufacturer is the only vendor qualified to provide software revisions to the proprietary software, product corrective actions, and telephone technical and troubleshooting assistance. The manufacturer will replace and/or repair all defective parts including lasers on an unlimited basis. Because this proprietary instrument is uniquely designed for this lab, the manufacturer is the only vendor familiar with its service requirements. Timely repair is necessary for this busy core lab cell sorter and BD Biosciences has a large staff of qualified local field service representatives readily available as needed.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on&nbsp;March 11&nbsp;, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.

<a href="mailto:GILHAM.MICHAEL@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotation (RFQ), number RFQ-DC-11-00036, is for an Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (EDXRF) that will be used by the Environmental Protection Agency's National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC) to analyze samples of environmental importance. The range of sample types that NEIC can potentially be tasked to analyze is very wide and, because samples are related to legal casework, cannot be released to the public for outside analysis.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-48.  The NAICS code for this RFQ is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:   The EDXRF system shall possess the following:
1.  Polarizing optical geometry. 
2.  Secondary and polarizing targets to allow for Compton scattering.
3.  An x-ray tube with sufficient power to allow for the excitation and analysis of the K lines of heavier [above Barium] elements.  
4.  The x-ray tube shall be under warranty for at least two-years. 5.  The ability to analyze the elements rhodium, palladium, silver, cadmium, tin, and antimony with the lowest detection limits, and with as much sensitivity, as possible.
6.  Optical design that allows for the analysis of delicate samples (e.g. filters) without damage to the samples.
7.  A detector that is 100 percent efficient up to at least 50 kiloelectron volts (keV).
8.  Helium flushing system for the analysis of loose powders and liquids.
9.  A sample changer able to accommodate a minimum of 24 samples.
10.  Operation on 110 Volt power and no need for external cooling water or counter gas. 
DELIVERY LOCATION:  The system shall be delivered, FOB destination, to the EPA, NEIC Building 25, Door E-3, Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado 80225. 
EVALUATION FACTORS:  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order to the responsible vendor whose quote, conforming to the RFQ provisions meets the technical specifications and provides the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Non-price evaluation factors are the ability to meet technical specifications and past performance.  Non-price factors are significantly more important than price. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.219-6, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-50, 52.225-1, 52.225-3, 52.225-13, and 52.232-33.  These provisions may be viewed electronically at www.arnet.gov.  Award can only be made to a vendor that is currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  QUOTE SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Quotes shall be submitted via e-mail to Michael Gilham at gilham.michael@epa.gov.  Quotes must be received by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on March 4, 2011.  Any questions regarding this RFQ must be submitted via e-mail.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Please note that the Government of Colombia has voiced concern to USAID about prospective offerors creating unrealistic expectations amongst Colombian organizations and communities. It appears that in their efforts to collect information from government officials, some prospective offerors are inadvertently creating expectations among organizations and communities that they are visiting. While we appreciate the need to collect information to prepare strong proposals, we request that at the same time offerors practice discretion and transparency with all concerned about the reasons for collecting this information.<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%"> </span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This job consists of removal of vegetation, debris, and sediment from within the dam forebay for maintenance purposes.  Removal will occur in two adjacent areas and will include installation of a temporary road and bridge to allow for excavation equipment access to the areas.  One area is approximately 500 feet in length and is approximately 50 feet each side of an existing crib and cable debris barrier. Thirty (30) feet each side of the barrier would be excavated down to elevation 1257 feet, the outward edge of the excavation area is to be on a 1 foot vertical to 3 foot horizontal cut slope, and required to daylight to existing ground.  The second area is approximately 250 feet in length, a strip approximately 20 feet in width, which runs parallel with the upstream face of the diversion dam.  The excavation would begin at approximate elevation 1247 nearest the dam face to 20 feet upstream.  The upstream edge of excavation area is to be on a 1 foot vertical to 3 foot horizontal cut slope, and required to daylight to existing ground elevation.  An estimated 3,000 - 5,000 cubic yards of sediment would be removed.  The temporary road is approximated to be 650 feet long, 12 feet wide, and with a 4 inch surface layer of gravel.  A temporary bridge structure is required for access over the existing channel in order to reach both ends of the barrier structure.  This is a meandering creek channel and varies in width and location due to annual flows.  In addition, this work requires a fish retention net to be installed upstream of the project work site and fish removed from the project site prior to sediment removal.  Pre, during, and post construction turbidity monitoring will be required.  All in-water work activities will be required to occur between July 15 and August 15, 2011.<BR><BR>Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://www.usace.army.mil/CESO/Documents/EM385-1-1FINAL.pdf.  <BR><BR>Solicitation number W912EF-11-B-0002 will be posted to the FBO website on or about April 7, 2011.

<DESC>The Product Manager, Command Post Systems and Integration (CPS&I), at Redstone Arsenal, AL, is researching technologies to constitute a Company Command Post System (CCPS).  The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for quote (RFQ), request for proposal (RFP), an invitation for bid (IFB) or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service.  There shall be no basis for claims against the government as a result of information submitted in response to the sources sought announcement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for any information submitted by respondents to this request. This notice is for market research purposes only and is not indicative of a full requirement.  Should a full requirement arise, the full requirement will be detailed in the solicitation, if issued.<BR><BR>The principle goal of this effort is to identify potential technologies and solutions for a CCPS conceptually consisting of a Commander's vehicle and Command Post (CP) support trailer.  This is research only and no draft performance specification has been developed; however, the system concept, comprising of a vehicle and trailer, expects the vehicle and trailer to operate together and independently.<BR><BR><BR>Operations Concept<BR>	a.  The Company Command Post (CP) for maneuver, fires, and engineer companies in Infantry, Heavy, and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) facilitates the fusion of maneuver, intelligence, and fires information.  The CP provides the Company Commander effective situational awareness (SA), allowing him to better plan and execute operations, understand the current situation and effectively visualize, describe, and direct subordinates.  The CP conducts point-to-point voice communications and sends and receives data, imagery, and geospatial information that updates the common operational picture.  The ability to send and receive maneuver, fires, intelligence, and sustainment voice and data to both higher headquarters and subordinates is critical to the Company's ability to conduct full spectrum operations over extended distances.<BR><BR>	b.  Company missions are categorized using a 3-Tiered operational concept.  The commander must have support from a CP element in all Tiers.  The 3-Tiered concept describes capabilities available across a series of Mission, Enemy, Terrain and Weather, Time, Troops Available and Civilian (METT-TC) conditions ranging from the most austere conditions, Tier 1, to the most robust conditions, Tier 3.  It is important to note that a unit may have elements operating in more than one tier at a time, adding additional challenges to mission command capabilities.  The conditions for the 3-Tiered operational concept are:<BR><BR>		(1)  Tier 1 - Dismounted Operations in Complex, Restrictive Terrain:  For operations in these conditions, the company command group is forward and consists of the Company Commander, the Company Fire Support Officer (FSO), additional headquarters personnel required by the commander, and any mission command capabilities they carry on their backs.  These capabilities include line of sight (LOS) and beyond line of sight (BLOS) voice communications and limited bandwidth data communications (e.g. Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Army Navy/Portable Radio Communications (AN/PRC) 117G, Global Rapid Response Information Package (GRRIP), Nett Warrior (NW), Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) Handheld (HH).  The FSO will have fires software applications and voice and digital communications to execute Army and Joint fires.  Bandwidth limitations will degrade the functional capabilities of the intelligence analyst.   Size, weight and power (SWaP) are significant constraints for Tier 1, limiting the ability to employ CP assets forward.  Tier 1 operations are typically short in duration and mission command capabilities begin to improve as more robust systems are brought forward.<BR><BR>		(2)  Tier 2 - Operations Supported with Wheeled, Armored, or Mechanized Forces:  For operations in these conditions, the Company Commander's tactical vehicle and the supporting fire support team (FIST) vehicle can move forward to the dismounted unit location to add more robust capabilities to those available in Tier 1.  The Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) Company Commander will not normally fight from his vehicle but will use it for battlefield circulation and as an enabler for designated CP personnel to use the increased network capabilities (e.g. Soldier Network Extension (SNE), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) on the vehicle to support mission command systems (e.g. Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) and Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A)).  Heavy, Stryker, Fires, and Engineer Company Commanders have the option of fighting from their tactical vehicles and take advantage of the organic BLOS and LOS network capabilities.  Later in Tier 2, CP assets that can be transported by wheeled assets or helicopter sling load can be emplaced in remote combat outposts.  SWaP considerations, while not as austere as in Tier 1, remain for the CP assets.  The company must be prepared to logistically support CP operations.<BR><BR>		(3)  Tier 3 - Operations from a Secure Forward Operating Base (FOB):  For operations in these conditions, all of the previous capabilities remain but the Company CP may take advantage of a more robust and fixed infrastructure if emplaced on a combat outpost or FOB.  The company may choose to off load systems from the tactical CP platform, or trailer, into an outpost/FOB infrastructure that includes hard buildings, electrical outlets, more generators and large fixed communications antennas.  While Tier 3 conditions allow the greatest relief from SWaP constraints, the company CP could be forward deployed into Tier 1 or Tier 2 conditions at any time.<BR><BR><BR>Company Command Post System Concept:<BR><BR>The Company Command Post System is defined to include the ability to operate On-The-Move (OTM), At-The-Quick-Halt (ATQH) and At-The-Halt (ATH).  The system components are defined to consist of a Commander's vehicle and a trailer mounted Command Post System.  The Commander's vehicle must operate as a standalone OTM, ATQH and ATH.  The trailer mounted Command Post System operates ATH as a standalone system.  The vehicle is defined as a Mine Resistant Ambush Protect (MRAP) - All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) and the trailer mounted system must be towable by the Commander's vehicle.  Both system components are expected to be packaged/mounted as a rugged system component and physically transportable via air, rail and ship.  <BR><BR>Commander's Vehicle:<BR><BR>* Capable of supporting voice and data operations via terrestrial and celestial communications means.<BR>* Capable of supporting military software systems deemed appropriate at the Company level.<BR>* Capable of supporting a Local Area Network.<BR>* Capable of supporting a dismounted Company Commander. <BR>* Capable of shared operations with the trailer mounted system.<BR>* Capable of communications Beyond Line-of-Sight operations from the trailer mounted system.<BR>* Capable of interoperating with existing Army Command Post Platforms (CPP) and other Tactical Operations Center (TOC) assets currently fielded by the US Army.<BR>* Operated, stowed, and transported in a tactical environment subject to extreme climate conditions.<BR>* System power is assumed provided by the vehicle while separated from the trailer mounted system and while OTM and ATQH.<BR><BR><BR>Trailer Mounted Command Post System (TMCPS):<BR>* Capable of supporting voice and data operations via terrestrial and celestial communications means.<BR>* Capable of supporting military software systems deemed appropriate at the Company level.<BR>* Capable of supporting a Local Area Network.<BR>* Capable of providing environmental protection to staff and equipment.<BR>* Capable of shared operations with the Commander's vehicular system.<BR>* Capable of communications Beyond Line-of-Sight operations from the Commander's vehicular system.<BR>* Capable of interoperating with existing Army Command Post Platforms (CPP) and other TOC assets currently fielded by the US Army.  <BR>* Operated, stowed, and transported in a tactical environment subject to extreme climate conditions.<BR>* System power is assumed provided by the trailer mounted system for Company Command Post operations while ATH.  <BR><BR><BR>Technology Information Desired:<BR>* Technologies are sought to facilitate collaborative staff functions in a tactical environment.<BR>* Technologies are sought to save power.<BR>* Technologies are sought to improve mobility and capabilities of a command post.<BR>* Technologies are sought that are simple to use with minimal training.<BR>* Technologies are sought to minimize or eliminate the number of specialized staff required at a command post.<BR>* Technologies must be compatible with JTRS waveforms and (Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 2.<BR>* Technologies must be a Non-Developmental Item (NDI).<BR>* No special tools should be required for assembly/disassembly. <BR>Vendor responses will assist the Government in determining a potential future performance specification by providing information about the technical capabilities of available commercial/industrial non-developmental systems and components.  <BR><BR>Sources Sought Instructions: A written response, not to exceed five (5) pages, with detailed information is requested of those suppliers who can provide components, systems or sub-systems to permit the Government to determine the feasibility of developing a Company Command Post System performance specification or similar specifications.  Detailed information shall include the vendor's capability of providing the required goods and current commercial availability.  Please provide name of the business, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.<BR>Please provide any Vendor CAGE Code and the NAICS Code representing a vendor's system or component.  All interested parties should identify if they are a small or large business. <BR><BR>Please respond by March 18, 2011 to the following Point of Contact: Mr. Brian Ridley, brian.ridley1@us.army.mil <BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Topic Title: Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Technologies<BR><BR>ISR Sub-Topic #1: Radar Technologies and Techniques<BR>Technical POC: Frank Gillan, RDER-IWR-RS<BR>Email: frank.gillan@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Requirements: (Abbreviated; see TRADOC Pamphlet 525-66, revised 7 March 2008)<BR><BR>TRADOC FOC-05-01: LOS/BLOS Lethality.  Fires are categorized as LOS, BLOS, or NLOS. Engagement range is not directly tied to the definitions of LOS, BLOS, and NLOS fires.  Thus, the method used, rather than the range, determines the type of engagement.  However, as a general guideline, LOS engagements occur at a maximum range of 5 km, BLOS engagements occur up to 16 km.  Some future Modular Force combat systems may have the ability for more than one method (such as LOS and BLOS).  Fire control and distribution requires responsiveness with fires on demand to engage complex and simultaneous target sets executed as preplanned or opportunity engagements.  Future Modular Force combat systems must be capable of automated precision engagements, with automated fire control, and distribution and clearance procedures with a manual backup.  Future Modular Force combat systems must be capable of precision, cooperative, and autonomous/designate LOS and BLOS; and be able to defeat helicopters and UAS.<BR><BR>TRADOC FOC-05-02: NLOS Lethality.  Extended range NLOS lethality overmatch is a key component required for all potentially hostile operations, and provides the means to achieve decisive operations, freedom of maneuver, and FP in highly volatile, distributed environments.  Capabilities for NLOS fires and effects must extend seamlessly, from tactical to operational levels, with no gaps in coverage, or loss of timeliness.  Advanced, automated fire control and distribution means must sort out HPTs and the most dangerous targets rapidly in depth, amongst the vast array of threat intelligence.<BR><BR>TRADOC FOC-07-02: Protect Physical Assets.  The continuous and cyclical nature of protecting critical assets is described by the interaction of the force operations activities related to sensing, understanding, deciding, and executing the tasks necessary to ensure attacks on critical assets are avoided.  The future Modular Force must be able to monitor, detect, track and engage adversary actions against critical facilities and infrastructure in sufficient time and distance to enable protection activities execution (adequately protecting these facilities and infrastructure and allowing time to assess the effectiveness of protection measures, and provide for sufficient mitigation and negation of these attacks through active and passive measures).  Sensing physical attacks, such as air and missile attacks, cyber attacks, and sub-surface attacks against critical facilities will require pulling together multiple sensing capabilities and information input sources.<BR><BR>TRADOC FOC-08-02: Enable Theater Access.  Enabling theater access provides proactive means to ensure forces can deploy, and freely enter the theater of operations, by enhancing entry capabilities and infrastructure, mitigating adverse effects of the environment (terrain, weather, enemy action, infrastructure, industrial hazards, and local population), and protecting/facilitating multiple ports of debarkation, LOC, and theater entry points.  Once the foothold is established, the focus of enable theater access changes to continuing the flow into, and out of, the theater, as well as enabling 'intratheater access' in support of operational maneuver.<BR><BR>Objectives:<BR><BR>The Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) seeks innovation in the areas of radar technology development, radar system development, and radar modeling and analysis.  The objective of this sub-topic is to provide I2WD with capabilities focused in the following areas:<BR><BR>1.  Research, development, test and evaluation of technologies and techniques which can affordably be inserted into existing and/or developmental ground based radar programs to improve performance and functionality.  Possible areas of investigation may include, but are not limited to:<BR><BR>-semiconductor devices, circuit designs, and/or transmit/receive module packaging concepts for providing higher power, improved efficiency and improved reliability over current designs.<BR><BR>-beamforming techniques for improved performance: digital beamforming, adaptive beamforming.<BR><BR>-multi-static sensor surveillance, both active and passive.<BR><BR>-wide-band/multi-band antennas for multi-mission or adaptive-mission capabilities.<BR><BR>-improved clutter handling algorithms, improved clutter modeling, adaptive clutter cancellation.<BR><BR>2.  Research, development, test, evaluation and/or technical analyses of existing, developmental and/or future radar systems to determine methods of  or achieving full objective performance against identified capability gaps in the areas of indirect fire weapons location, air surveillance and air defense.  This may include design, development and demonstration of prototype radar systems or sub-systems, modeling and simulation, test and/or demonstration of capabilities using developed or existing radar systems.  Focus areas may include, but are not limited to:<BR><BR>-achieving full hemispherical surveillance coverage, target tracking and location of a variety of conventional and non-conventional threats (indirect fire weapons, direct fire weapons, top attack, air breathing targets, etc) to support missions such as sense and warn and counterfire target acquisition.<BR><BR>-high accuracy tracking to support accurate launch-point-location and/or impact point prediction of indirect fire weapons and cueing to support hand-off to weapons engagement systems.<BR><BR>-methods of achieving improved situational awareness through integration, networking and/or cooperative control/cueing of multiple radar systems, or through integration of additional intelligence sources to assist in base and area defense. <BR><BR>-multiple-mission capabilities to simultaneously support air surveillance, air defense and aviation requirements.<BR><BR>-performance capabilities of existing systems while under varying levels of electronic attack, and countermeasures which can be inserted into existing systems to improve performance while under those levels of attack.<BR>

<DESC>A Defense Science Board (DSB) Task Force study) concluded that DoD operations suffer from unnecessarily high -- and growing -- battlespace fuel demand.  At ~70% of the tonnage the Army ships into battle, fuel is the single largest consumable, and in-theatre costs render this metric monetarily and logistically dominant compared to all other factors.<BR><BR>The three (or four) sink process of washing rinsing and sanitizing consumes hundreds of gallons of water and many gallons of fuel (to heat all of that water) per day.  It also requires a lot of space and is currently deployed in a separate tent as a separate system called the Food Sanitation Center.<BR><BR>Rack type dishwashers use high pressure hot water to wash rinse and sanitize in one cabinet.  They use less than a gallon of water per cycle and the cycle time is less than a minute.  Natural gas fired options are available and require 1500 watts or less, mostly for the pump(s).  They can do the same job as an entire food sanitation center, but can do so with 20% of the water and fuel and 1/3 of the space.<BR><BR>Automatic dishwashers also have a greater potential to reduce water use over batch systems because of their variable water use.  The system uses only the water it needs, where the food sanitation center uses water in 60 gallon increments.  Furthermore, because the maximum greywater generated by the automatic dishwasher is 1 gal/min, many more greywater systems are compatible with this system than with batch systems.<BR><BR>A dishwashing system is desired that is either commercial-off-the-shelf modified or custom designed to be mobile, lightweight, diesel or JP-8 fired, demand 1kW or less power and able to wash large field feeing equipment such as: insulated food containers, 10 gal and 15 gal stockpots, and full sized baking trays.  While commercial dishwashers perform as necessary, they weigh 300 lbs or more and are too heavy to move.  The desired system will be modular: each piece weighing 100 lbs or less, and easily assembled for use on a kitchen or elsewhere.  The width of the dishwasher is to be either 22 inches or 44 inches.  The height shall not exceed 50 inches when in an assembled, packed configuration.<BR>

<p>This contract shall include the management and operation of two on-site cafeterias, site wide vending and the opportunity to compete for catering operations.</p>
<p>The scope of this Statement of Work (SOW) does not impact Fire and Security systems; however, regular Security Escort will be required for various areas of the site until adequate Security Clearances can be obtained.</p>
<p>This contract shall be established as Profit/Loss with no cost to B&amp;W Pantex for Food Service operations.</p>
<p>This contract shall be for a length of one year with the option for four one year extensions.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>B&amp;W Pantex is under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage and operate the Pantex Plant. The Pantex Plant is a DOE/National Nuclear Security Administration facility located in Carson County, approximately 17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas. <br />The Pantex Plant is the United States only nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility. The Pantex Plant has five primary operational missions:<br />&bull; Weapons Assembly<br />&bull; Weapons Disassembly<br />&bull; Evaluation of Weapons<br />&bull; High Explosive Research and Development<br />&bull; Interim Plutonium Pit Storage</p>
<p>The plant is a secure site, and as such, various levels of security clearances are required for anyone working at the plant. No one from the general public is permitted on site without advance notification.<br />There is a significant level of highly specialized training required of most of the employees due to the mission of the plant. In addition, a special fire department is maintained at the plant to further ensure safety.<br />The majority of employees working at the Pantex Plant are contract employees and of those, the majorities are B&amp;W Pantex employees.</p>
<p>1.3 LOCATIONS<br />Location of work will be as follows:<br />Cafeteria operations shall be in the 12-70 Main Cafeteria and 12-103 satellite Cafeteria.</p>
<p>Vending operations shall take place in numerous buildings site-wide with proper approval.</p>
<p>Catering operations shall take place in numerous buildings site-wide with proper approval. <br />The locations of work are in:<br />Cafeterias - Property Protected Area (PPA)<br />Vending - Property Protected Area (PPA), Limited Area (LA), Protected Area (PA) and Material Access Area (MAA).</p>
<p>Catering Operations - Property Protected Area (PPA) and Limited Area (LA)<br />These locations are not in an area controlled for radiological purposes.</p>
<p>NOTE: 12-70 Cafeteria<br /><br />The 12-70 cafeteria is a modified hollow open square servery design with various hot and cold attended and self-service stations around the perimeter of a rectangular shaped servery and a large self-service salad bar in the center.</p>
<p>There are three cashier stations. Cashiers accept both cash and payroll deduction for payment of food in the cafeteria. Payroll deduction is a convenience for some employees who do not carry change simply because they have to pass through metal detectors coming and going to their work stations, or for other employees who simply appreciate the convenience of having a payroll deduction system.</p>
<p>The kitchen and servery were both renovated in 1997, and contain a full complement of hot and cold food production and serving equipment. (Refer to Exhibit 2 - Food Service Equipment Lists)<br />The 12-70 cafeteria dining room has approximately 310 seats. All equipment is owned by the US government with the exception of vendor provided equipment and leased equipment that includes several beverage dispensers in the servery including the vending machines.</p>
<p>In addition to pump type condiment dispensers, salad dressings and condiments are all in portion control packages in this cafeteria.<br /><br />The POS (point of sale) cash register systems are Micros with integrated scales for by-the-ounce products and card scanners for the payroll deduct system.</p>
<p>The 12-70 servery has the following stations:</p>
<p>&bull; Entrees/Grill <br />&bull; Deli <br />&bull; Salad Bar/Soup <br />&bull; Cold Beverages (bottled, carton, fountain) <br />&bull; Coffee <br />&bull; Desserts Chilled and Frozen<br />&bull; Grab and Go <br />&bull; Cashiers (3)</p>
<p>The following is a representative sample of menu items that are currently offered in the 12-70 Cafeteria. The contractor will be expected to include an appropriate number of healthful food choices at each meal period, which are not of the microwaveable nature to insure a healthy aspect of the food product.</p>
<p>BREAKFAST</p>
<p>Scrambled Eggs<br />Eggs to Order<br />Pancakes<br />Sausage,<br />Bacon<br />Fresh Baked Biscuits<br />Hot and Cold Cereals<br />Breakfast Breads<br />Whole Fruit<br />Yogurt<br /><br />LUNCH</p>
<p>Cold Foods</p>
<p>Self-serve Salad Bar<br />Pre-packaged Salads<br />Yogurt, Fresh Fruits<br />Made-to-Order Deli Sandwiches<br />Pre-packaged Sandwiches<br />Assorted Cakes, Pies, Cookies, Puddings</p>
<p>Hot Foods</p>
<p>Soups (1 daily)<br />Meat, Fish, or Poultry Entrees (2 daily)<br />Pantexan Special (entr&eacute;e, 2 vegetables, roll)<br />Grilled Foods: Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Chili Dogs, French Fries, Grilled Sandwiches<br />Potato/Starch (1 to 2 daily)<br />Vegetables (2 to 3 daily)</p>
<p><br />The 12-103 cafeteria is much smaller than the 12-70 cafeteria and is a straight line designed cafeteria, meaning that customers must follow the same path through the servery, selecting their items from self-service and attended stations and then pass by the single POS cashier station.</p>
<p>Most food served here is prepared in the 12-70 cafeteria and brought to the 12-103 cafeteria in insulated hot food mobile carts as well as cold food mobile carts. The foods are delivered in the Food service step van.</p>
<p>In addition to pump type condiment dispensers, salad dressings and condiments are all in portion control packages in this cafeteria.</p>
<p>There are approximately 162 seats in the dining room area. There is a double door domestic refrigerator and a freezer on one side of the dining room for employees who wish to store their lunches brought from home.</p>
<p>The 12-103 servery has the following stations:</p>
<p>&bull; Entrees/Grill/Soup<br />&bull; Premade Sandwiches <br />&bull; Premade Salads <br />&bull; Cold Beverages (bottled, carton) <br />&bull; Coffee <br />&bull; Desserts Chilled and Frozen<br />&bull; Grab and Go <br />&bull; Cashier (1)</p>

The contractor will be expected to include an appropriate number of healthful food choices at each meal period, which are not of the microwaveable nature to insure a healthy aspect of the food product. <br /><br />BREAKFAST</p>
<p>Scrambled Eggs<br />Eggs to Order<br />Pancakes<br />Sausage, Bacon<br />Fresh Baked Biscuits<br />Hot and Cold Cereals<br />Breakfast Breads<br />Whole Fruit<br />Yogurt<br /><br />LUNCH</p>

<p>Beverages <br />Regular and Decaffeinated Coffee, Tea, Iced Tea<br />Juice Drinks, Soft Drinks, <br />Bottled Beverages, Milk</p>
<p>Patrons consult the menu board, enter the servery, pick up trays or take-out containers, and proceed to collect food items from the stations in the servery. Patrons tender payment at the cashiers' station and exit the servery, where they pick up flatware, napkins, and select desired condiments.</p>
<p>Patrons currently dispose of their trash in refuse containers, deposit their reusable glassware, flatware and plates in the wash tubs and deposit their trays at the tray drop window, which will continue to be the standard procedure in this contract.</p>
<p>Food service employees circulate within the dining room to maintain its cleanliness and orderliness.</p>
<p>Method of Payment</p>
<p>The method of payment in the cafeterias is cash and payroll deduction. Over 75% of the sales in the cafeterias are by employees using the payroll deduction system.</p>
<p>Credit Card payment is an option that can be evaluated, however, will require addition software/hardware and service costs. Software/hardware will be furnished by B&amp;W Pantex upon determination of need; however, all service fees to a credit card provider will be incurred by the Contractor and not B&amp;W Pantex.</p>
<p>Policies of B&amp;W Pantex that Affect Food Service<br /><br />Employees are permitted 30 minutes for lunch from the time they leave their work area until they return. Most Pantex employees walk to the nearest cafeteria for lunch, or bring their lunch from home. It is essential that the cafeteria provide prompt and efficient service due to this time constraint.</p>
<p>Government/company vehicles are not to be used for going to lunch. There is no free coffee service to employees. Coffee is available at the cafeterias. Individual departments may or may not have their own coffee machines.</p>
<p>Food at desks is permitted; however, there are several work areas that prohibit food and beverages.</p>

<DESC>On behalf of The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), the independent Federal agency that administers the AbilityOne Program, (National Industries for the Blind (NIB), a designated central nonprofit agency, is pursuing potential partnerships with U.S. commercial manufacturers of Green Floor Care Cleaning Chemicals for the purpose of providing employment for people who are blind or severely disabled by furnishing such products to the Federal government under the AbilityOne Program. If successful, the result will be a co-brand agreement between the manufacturer and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands. The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the Committee's Procurement List (PL).
<p><br />At minimum, the following product requirements must be met:</p>
<p>1. A full line of green chemical cleaning products that includes but is not limited to:<br />a. Floor cleaners<br />b. Floor strippers<br />c. Floor finishes<br />2. Product certifications should include one or more of the following:<br />a. Green Seal<br />b. EcoLogo<br />c. DfE - EPA Design for the Environment<br />3. Meet and/or exceed the FAR and other published Federal standards, including Executive Orders and applicable agency-unique requirements. <br />4. Must not contain ozone depleting substances.<br /><br />To be considered for the partner opportunity, the following criteria at a minimum must be met by the commercial manufacturer:</p>
<p>1. Possession of a nationally-known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales and market share. <br />2. Ability to offer a complete line of green floor care cleaning chemicals.<br />3. Manufacturers' response must include the material safety data sheets (MSDS) and general product information.<br />4. Willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement, which includes on-going technical and production assistance while enabling the selected nonprofit agency to meet the suitability criteria of the AbilityOne Program in the production process by delivering the green floor care cleaning chemicals to the nonprofit agency's facility in bulk form and instructing the nonprofit agency in proper techniques to complete the manufacturing and subsequent packaging of the products, thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled. <br />5. The chosen commercial manufacturer must be willing to set a high priority for delivering the materials to the nonprofit agency in order to assure the agency of on-time deliveries to the end-use customers.<br />6. Commitment to working cooperatively with AbilityOne personnel to market the products to government customers under the AbilityOne Program.<br />7. Willingness to work with the selected nonprofit agency, NIB and the Committee to ensure that the products' price to end-users is a fair and reasonable price.<br />8. All products must be manufactured and lab tested, certified and customer tested to be effective according to their purpose.<br />9. Manufacturers' submissions must demonstrate that the specific products meet the various criteria, as well as indicate what functions the nonprofit agency's employees would perform. Submission should recommend ways to maximize the employment for people who are blind or severely disabled in the fulfillment of the products.</p>
<p>The deadline for response is March 25, 2011.</p>
<p>Responses should be directed to the contact listed in this Notice.</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to Michelle Grant at 703-310-0321.</p>

<DESC>RFI for NVIS-Compatible Lighting Filter System for C-130H2 Aircraft<BR><BR>As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.  (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this request for information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on aircraft cockpit lighting technologies that have already been developed or may be modified from other Aerospace Industry solutions to meet the agency requirement as listed below:<BR><BR>The Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) is conducting an effort to determine potential sources for cockpit lighting filter solutions compatible with night vision imaging systems (NVIS) on Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) C-130H2 or earlier aircraft.  This announcement is for informational purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal. <BR><BR>AATC is seeking contractors interested in providing affordable, readily available cockpit lighting filter solutions compatible with NVIS using the latest military and/or commercial off-the shelf (COTS) technology with minor modifications that can be used as part of an Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE) effort.  <BR><BR>System Requirements: <BR>1.	Solutions must ensure the cockpit's non-NVIS compatible illuminated instruments/systems/equipment meet MIL-STD-3009 and ASC/ENFC 96-01 requirements for NVIS compatibility;<BR>2.	 Provide daylight readability;<BR>3.	System should be physically robust, and allow rapid and repeated removal and installation without physical degradation;<BR>4.	System should provide provisions for existing internally illuminated instruments to maintain cooling characteristics;<BR>5.	System should prevent any glow or back light leakage from internally illuminated instruments which may cause non-NVIS compatibility.<BR><BR>Known Instruments affected: <BR>Pilot's attitude direction indicator (ADI), horizontal situation indicator (HSI), barometric altimeter and radar altimeter, as well as the nose-wheel steering azimuth indicator.  On the copilot's instrument panel, the system will cover ADI, HSI, barometric altimeter, liquid oxygen level indicator, and the altitude alerter and radar display located on top of the glareshield.  <BR><BR>Objective of OUE is to demonstrate and validate potential interim solutions for recommendation for fielding options within the next 1-3 years.  Proposed start dates for OUE is 6 Apr 2011.  Actual fielding decision is beyond the scope, intent, or authority of this RFI or OUE.  Potential for follow-on procurement is dependent on results of tests and availability of funding.  The government is looking for a system that offers the best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost.  Mission effectiveness and safety are key considerations.<BR><BR>Interested parties capable of providing a NVIS-compatible system that meets or exceeds the above requirements, shall provide a statement of capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system, along with a description of system capabilities.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) is requested as part of the RFI and will be used as market research. The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify the system capability as related to the technical effort requested. A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses, which should be received by close of business 11 Mar 2011.  Testing results are expected to determine the most effective system. <BR><BR>Please e-mail all information and SOC to the AATC Contracting Officer, SMSgt Jon Ransom, at jon.ransom@ang.af.mil. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this synopsis. <BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>AATC, Bldg 10<BR>1600 E.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible business firms capable of performing construction services for the following project for Dry Dock No 1, Concrete Wall and Floor Repairs, NSS PORTSMOUTH NAVY SHIPYARD KITTERY, MAINE 

Description of proposed project:  

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  The intent of this notice is to identify potential firms capable of providing services for the stated project.  This project is to repair Dry Dock #1 concrete walls, caisson seat, concrete floor, and concrete floor drainage structures.
 Replace Pumpwell #1 heating, ventilation, and dehumidification system. Dry dock repair will include removing spalled, weakened concrete and damaged reinforcing steel until sound concrete is found. Once sound concrete is found, the repair will continue with replacing reinforcing steel and re-forming and replacing concrete walls, floors, seats, and drainage structures. Pumpwell work will involve replacing large heating and ventilation air handlers and replacing dehumidification components. 
Additional Information:  The existing condition of Dry Dock #1 walls and floor consists of reinforced concrete that was constructed in 1941-1943. The floor slab and walls have sufficient weight to resist hydrostatic uplift pressures and the dock is certified for 30 long tons per foot.
 Current test bores of the concrete show areas of un-bonded course aggregate. This inferior concrete is causing much of the surface cracking and spalling seen on almost the entire surface of the walls.
Poor drainage is a contributing cause of excessive spalling of the floor. The dry dock pumpwell is critical to the overall safety of the Fleet's submarines and shipyard employees. The equipment in the pumpwell is responsible for all auxiliary and main dewatering as well as flooding alarms and controls. The pumpwell is heated with a steam coil heat exchanger which had to be taken out of service this winter due to leaks.
It could not be repaired. Temporary portable electric heaters were used to provide heat but were not adequate.
 The existing dehumidifiers do not control the environment satisfactorily and several electric actuators and a motor controller have failed.  


All Service Disabled Veteran (SDV) small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses, and other certified small businesses are encouraged to respond.

Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Governments best interest.  This office anticipates award of a contract for these services in May 2011.  The appropriate NAICS code for this procurement is 23.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ) or a promise to issue an RFQ. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supplies or services. The USPTO is not seeking proposals at this time. The Government will not pay any costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. It is the intent of the USPTO to use this market research information to assist in planning.
<p>The USPTO utilizes Momentum, a CGI Federal commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, for its financial and acquisition system of record. The USPTO houses and manages all hardware, software, integrations, and third party products associated with the Momentum application. Under a GSA Schedule task order, CGI Federal currently provides: professional services for on-site operations and maintenance of Momentum and the integrations between Momentum and other automated systems; overall project management services; a Helpdesk that furnishes functional support to system users; technical staff for system and integration support; services to develop and maintain custom reports; and support for upgrades and various system-related projects. In addition, the USPTO obtains Momentum software licenses and software maintenance under this task order with CGI Federal.</p>
<p>The USPTO has one Momentum production environment and four Momentum test environments, utilizing a total of 25 servers with ten integrations. The total production database size including the failover database is 2.0 terabytes, and the total test database size is 4.0 terabytes. All of the databases are Oracle, and the test databases are production-sized and refreshed with scrubbed production data periodically. The USPTO currently supports up to 450 users.</p>
<p>The USPTO is conducting research to determine the possibility of combining hosting of Momentum, and application management services for Momentum - the larger piece of this requirement, into a single acquisition, excluding Momentum licenses which the USPTO will continue to obtain from CGI Federal.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to identify and obtain information about vendors including GSA Schedule or blanket purchase agreement (BPA) holders who have experience in any of the following: managing the Momentum application, cloud computing, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and hosting applications.

The USPTO is considering the possibility of utilizing cloud computing solutions for this requirement. Potential offerors should note that cloud computing services may be included in any solicitation issued as a result of this RFI.</p>
<p>For this requirement, experience with hosting and/or managing services commensurate with the USPTO scope described above is required. Experience with the Federal information technology (IT) Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) process is also required. Experience with developing a strategy for and transitioning to a hosting site is desired. Teaming is encouraged if necessary to provide the complete range of experience in the required services. If the USPTO decides to acquire hosting services for Momentum, the hosting provider will be required: to ensure that direct user access to the system occurs only through the USPTO's secure network; to meet all Federal IT security requirements for the hosting site and facilities, data, hardware, applications, databases, operating systems, networks, interfaces, and integrations; to provide storage and tape backup management for the hosting environment; to plan for and implement a disaster recovery program for the hosting site; and to support Momentum operations 24 hours a day, seven days week, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>RFI responses should be no longer than ten pages and shall include, at a minimum:</p>
<p>1. An indication of interest in responding to a solicitation, should one be issued; <br />2. A brief capability statement with reference to each of the requirements listed herein; <br />3. An indication of whether teaming is intended, and if so, identification of each vendor involved in the team*; <br />4. The applicable GSA Schedule number(s) and/or IaaS BPA number for each vendor involved in the response; <br />5. Any recommendations regarding the acquisition strategy including the use of GSA Schedules and GSA's IaaS BPAs as well as the prospect of including both application management and cloud hosting under a single award; <br />6. For each vendor involved in a response, the business size for NAICS code 518210 Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services, $25M, and any recommendations, if any, for use of an alternate NAICS code;<br />7. Past performance summary of work performed in similar size and scope; and<br />8. Any performance metrics and/or service level agreements in place with other clients for system response time, system availability, and disaster recovery.</p>
<p>* Vendors are encouraged to add their information to the interested vendor list on the FedBizOpps site for this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses are due no later than noon (EST), March 21, 2011, and shall be submitted electronically to: Heather.Bakos@uspto.gov. All submissions will receive verification of receipt. If verification of receipt is not received within 24 hours of submission, the recipient may be reached via phone: 571.272.5361 or fax: 571.273.5361.</p>

<p>SECONDARY CONTACT:<br />Danny R. Sawyer, Contracting Officer<br />danny.r.sawyer@uscg.mil</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking information from any source for a certified Industrial Engineer to evaluate current processes used at the Heavy Maintenance Facility in Elizabeth City, NC for the Program Structural Inspection (PSI) of C-130 Aircraft undergoing Depot Maintenance in order to optimize the current processes thru lean initiatives. Once this is accomplished, using optimal processes and government provided work statements for both fixed price and time and material contracts, develop a performance work statement that can be used for obtaining fixed price contracts for PSI/Depot level maintenance, regardless of location.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The USCG currently operates an older fleet of 22 HC-130H aircraft and 6 HC-130J aircraft. Currently HC-130H aircraft undergo PSIs, on a fixed price contact, at TIMCO located in Lake City, FL and on a time and material contract at DRS Technologies Heavy Maintenance Facility (HMF) located in Elizabeth City, NC. Coast Guard HC-130J aircraft, which are relatively new, are currently undergoing PSIs at Elizabeth City HMF. Both of these contracts are up for renewal at end of FY12. Up until 2005 CG HC-130 aircraft were all repaired, under a fixed price contract, at various contractor facilities outside of the Elizabeth City area. With the opening of the HMF in Elizabeth City, in 2005, the Coast Guard obtained the ability to have PSIs done in Elizabeth City and take advantage of industrial capability of CG Aviation Logistics Center and aircraft product line technical and support services. The current contractor, DRS Technologies, uses government provide work deck which has been supplemented by work cards to accomplish PSI efforts. The government provides all equipment and material at the HMF facility while at the Lake City facility only repairable components are provided as stated in the existing PWS. <br /><br />REPLIES:<br />All interested parties should respond via Email to the two points of contact listed above. Request responders include cage code, website and capability statement that identifies similar projects. Provide business size.</p>

Introduction: 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  In accordance with FAR Part 10, Market Research, and as part of VA's market research process, this is a request for information (RFI) to assist us in developing an acquisition strategy for HCP claims processing system. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the VA.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available. Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  

Overview: 

A VA facility unable to meet the patient care requirements of a Veteran may authorize Fee Basis services (non-VA Care) for inpatient care, outpatient care, dental care, pharmaceutical care, or home health care from non-VA health care facilities.  Invoices for these services are then submitted to the authorizing VA facility, which processes the invoice for payment utilizing multiple Fee Software application. The Fee Basis packages provides for more efficient and accurate operation of the fee for service program with reduction of paperwork, savings in staff hours, minimization of errors, and by allowing medical facilities to have greater control over disbursement of fee medical, pharmacy, and travel monies.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO) requests enhancements to VistA and current Commercial of the Shelf (COTs) products currently in use to improve business processes that support the entire Non-VA Care Program.  These business processes include entering patient authorizations and vendor information, processing claims for approval/denial and transmitting completed batch data for processing at the VA's payment center in Austin, Texas.  

Background: 

VHA is comprised of 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) that are each responsible for managing health care activities within their geographic area that can include six to ten medical facilities and a number of supporting outpatient facilities.  Details can be found at http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1. VA medical centers within a VISN work together to provide efficient, accessible health care to Veterans in their areas.  With 163 VAMCs nationwide, VHA manages one of the largest health care systems in the United States.

At times, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities cannot provide all of the necessary outpatient, inpatient, dental, and pharmaceutical care and services required by its patients.  Additionally, the Veteran may not be able to access VA health care facilities based on geographic constraints or due to medical emergencies; or it could be economically advantageous for the VA to provide treatment to Veterans within the community they reside.  In these cases, the VA may authorize and pay for medical care to private sector providers for those Veterans who meet the eligibility requirements.  This concept is referred to as Fee Basis (or non-VA purchased) care.  With the exception of some medical emergencies, outpatient Fee care must be authorized before Veterans receive services from non-VA facilities/providers. 
 
The current Referral and Authorization process for the Fee Program is not integrated with the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), resulting in weaknesses in the internal controls needed to ensure that fee care is properly justified and authorized. CBO has identified the business need to create an integrated end to end future state claims processing system to include the standardization and automation of the Referral and Authorization application for all of Purchased Care. Future state processes to automate justification, authorization, coordination and documentation of fee care rely on integration with CPRS and VistA Imaging.

This request seeks to expand data capture efforts during authorization entry for inpatient and outpatient non-VA services in the Fee Basis software package via an interface from Fee Basis two-way data sharing with CPRS.  Mechanisms to ensure the proper steps are followed and documented in the approval process are also requested.  Key data elements to be added for any Fee service include data associated with requirements for ordering services and those associated with an industry standard health care claim such as the names of the referring VA clinician and the approving clinical review designee, cost analysis fee use justification (when necessary), type of medical care to be rendered, and auto-generated authorization funds estimate.  Additionally, Fee Basis authorization reports will need to be created/updated to include the new data elements and all data should be sent to Central Fee. 

In addition the current functionality of the Fee Basis software package does not allow the user the ability to complete all required actions needed during the Fee care authorization process to include the addition of foreign addresses for Veterans receiving Fee care at the Manila, Philippines and San Juan, Puerto Rico facilities, and Veterans who receive care in Canada. The foreign addresses data elements will be incorporated in any Fee Basis software components.

VHA seeks an integrated solution with the multiple claims processing systems.  The purpose is to improve the efficiency of certain business processes in its hospitals and clinics. The goals are to help:

"	Allow for a comprehensive clinical record of patient treatments and services provided under the authority of the VHA Purchased Care program.
"	Improve the accessibility of Purchased Care information in CPRS to assist clinicians complying with clinical practice guidelines and legislative mandates.
"	Provide relevant information to VA providers at the point of care for improving care for veterans.
"	Promote VA Provider satisfaction through the use of a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) which interfaces with VistA Imaging and incorporates standardized requirements for document submission.
"	Promote veteran satisfaction by facilitating an efficient Purchased Care referral process via an external system which leads to decreased waiting time.
"	Provide a source of information for a patient cost based benefit activity when patient requires treatment outside of their local VA medical facility.
"	Provide service level information to VA stakeholders for data-driven decision making, thus improving client satisfaction.
"	Generate the Authorization Letter/required forms to include approved clinical services and limitations.
"	Streamline and enhance VA Form 1358 Miscellaneous obligations for Purchased Care.
"	Establish an obligation to the VA Form 1358 at time of authorization based on applicable CPT code estimated cost.
"	Create alerts for VA Form 1358 balances for Purchased Care.
"	Manage the application of cost estimation to VA Form 1358 Obligations.
"	Automate the decrease/increase of the cost estimation to VA Form 1358 Obligations as the invoice is processed for payment.
"	Generate enhanced reports from Purchased Care obligation estimates.
"	Ability to complete all required actions needed during the Fee care authorization process to include the addition of foreign addresses for Veterans receiving Fee care at the Manila, Philippines, Canada, and San Juan, Puerto Rico facilities.

For the purpose of this RFI, "enterprise" is defined as deployment across all VISNs.  Solutions to be considered shall include: application software and all necessary hardware (servers).

Requirements:

1.	Assessment of capabilities to perform requirements noted in the RFI

2.	Assessment of the types of changes required to accomplish the goals

3.	Approach to be utilized to develop necessary changes to the systems to meet the organizational goals

4.	Draft schedule to complete necessary changes

Following is an overview of systems requirements:

"	Ability to interface the CPRS module with other VistA applications and COTS products.

"	Ability to manage two-way communication between Fee software and CPRS packages, to receive/send specific data elements from the applicable CPRS consult/note to any Fee software packages menu options

"	Ability to route clinical claim documentation to a work queue for review and processing (without impact on claim adjudication status)

"	Ability to interface with IFCAP to transmit disbursement detail to automatically post payments to the 1358, and make adjustments to the initial estimated obligation based on paid amounts.

"	VistA application enhancements for the Fee Basis and IFCAP modules.  Example of these enhancements would include the ability to:
"	Store additional data elements
"	Enter additional data elements
"	Auto-populate cost estimates
"	Enter a cost analysis Fee use justification if necessary
"	Transmit to the Central Fee database
"	Process cost estimates for pre-authorizations
"	Generate correspondence for Veteran/vendor education
"	Create additional cost estimate postings on claims
"	Automatically adjust obligation service balances based on paid amounts
"	Apply multiple claims payments
"	Limit remarks when printing

"	Ability to create all required interfaces (from end-to-end) in accordance with industry standards to communicate with VA information (legacy) systems:  Examples of the type of interface issues to be considered:
"	Programming M code (i.e. MUMPS-Massachusetts General 	Hospital Unitlity Multi-Programming System), to add/modify   within the VistA application.



"	Use of a government provided VistA test environment 

"	Ability to capture interface details through the creation of a      formal Interface Control Document (ICD). 

"	Ability to process incoming foreign address transmissions with the new address data elements.

<DESC>The OWL radar provides the ability to detect, track and locate mortar, cannon and rocket firing positions automatically, when fired in a variety of situations.  This includes conventional indirect weapon fires, in addition to, weapons fired with non-standard trajectories.  The system also has the ability to provide the location of weapons fired in mountainous terrain from elevations both above and below the radar.  The OWL provides high-quality track data on mortar, cannon, and rocket targets in order to be fully capable of providing a cue for handoff to fire control systems.  Additionally, the system provides quality impact point prediction with sufficient warning to improve force protection and take responsive measures in a timely manner.  The system also incorporates advanced techniques for system self-protection against Electronic Attack, i.e., jamming and deception.

The rotational capability shall facilitate 360 degree spinal fusions without the need to move the patient for repositioning.  The table shall measure less than 105 inches in length by less than 30 inches in width.
  The height of the table shall range down to at least 30 inches and up to at least 48 inches.  The table shall allow Trendelenburg and power tilt procedures within a 10-25 range.  The entire table system shall be completely radiolucent.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-398-2682<br />Name: Paper, Xerographic, 8-1/2" x 11", Neon Green<br />Description: Neon Green Copy Paper, 8-1/2"x11", 20 LB, 30% PCW recycled, 500 sheets per ream, 10 reams/carton, min.</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-398-2681<br />Name: Paper, Xerographic, 8-1/2" x 11", Neon Blue<br />Description: Neon Blue Copy Paper, 8-1/2"x11", 20 LB, 30% PCW recycled, 500 sheets per ream, 10 reams/carton, min.</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-398-2680<br />Name: Paper, Xerographic, 8-1/2" x 11", Neon Pink<br />Description: Neon Ping Copy Paper, 8-1/2"x11", 20 LB, 30% PCW recycled, 500 sheets per ream, 10 reams/carton, min.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-398-2682<br />Similar Items: CASMP2241LE, CASMP2201GS, OS1P1MP2201GS, WAU22581, WAU21588, WAU22378, MOW101261, PAC102053, PAC102224</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 10, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>U. S. - INDIA JOINT CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER
On November 4, 2010, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Government of India entered into an Agreement establishing the U. S. - India Joint Clean Energy Research and Development Center. The Center will facilitate joint research and development on clean energy by teams of scientists and engineers from India and the United States, and related joint activities, needed to deploy clean energy technologies rapidly with the greatest impact. To begin implementation of the Agreement, DOE and the Government of India are launching cooperation in three initial priority areas: (1) Energy Efficiency of Buildings, (2) Second-Generation Biofuels, and (3) Solar Energy.  
The U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Policy and International Affairs has the mission of facilitating this initiative. As a result, a competitive FOA will be released for prospective applicant's interested in forming a consortium of knowledgeable and experienced researchers from the public and private sectors, national laboratories, universities and other research, analytic and non-profit organizations to undertake the objectives above.  
In an effort to encourage interest, the DOE released a draft FOA for comment.  The draft FOA contains comprehensive information for this requirement.  The draft FOA may be accessed at: https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ by searching public opportunities for reference number DE-FOA-0000506.   Prospective applicants may submit questions no later than March 7, 2011 at 1:00 pm to the following e-mail address:  JCERDC@HQ.DOE.GOV.  All questions and comments will be reviewed by DOE and considered for inclusion in the final FOA.
It is anticipated that the competitive FOA will be released in March 2011.

<ARCHDATE>03122011
<CONTACT>Kevin D. Alexander, Contracting Officer, Phone 2024936152, Fax 2024936171, Email kevin.alexander@dot.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The FRA intends to negotiate a Firm-Fixed Price type contract entitled "Generalized Train Movement Simulator (GTMS) Phase IV" under circumstances permitting other than full and open competition. (FAR) 6.302.1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" [48 C.F.R. 6.302-1 (1989)]. This justification recommends that a contract be negotiated with Decisiontek, LLC as follow-on work to Phase III Generalized Train Movement Simulator. An Independent Government Cost Estimate of this proposed 18-month effort is $750,000.</p>
<p>GTMS software, developed by Decisiontek, LLC, is a simulation software that accomplishes the following: a) calculates the time, position, speed, and forces acting on a train; b) includes a train movement algorithm that accounts for changes in terrain and track curvature as each train move through a defined territory while observing speed limits and directives for routing and movement authorizations; c) provides the ability to specify random distribution of departure delays affecting each scheduled train; d) includes a central dispatcher that prioritized train movement, makes routing decisions, prevents train deadlock, and effects safe movement of the train; e) simulates of railroad operations including: regular timetable operations, GCOR Forms A and B, pick up and set out operations; f) supports a full range of railroad control technologies; and g) provides the ability to manage, share, and manipulate data; and h) provides the ability to track and report exposure events of interest including accidents and rare events.</p>
<p>Decisiontek, LCC is the sole company able to successfully develop a generalized train movement simulator that can serve as a platform for the fault injection, mathematical and statistical methods, and optimized computer run time risk assessment over a 20 year time horizon. An alternative contractor, other than Decisiontek, LLC would require at least 6 months lead time (and corresponding substantial costs) to master the subject matter listed below and to gain sufficient expertise with Phase III software code needed to successfully inject faults and measure the results required for Phase IV. Required subject matter: 1) PhD level understanding of complex theory from three academic fields (stochastic processes, graph theory, and computer engineering); 2) expert knowledge of complex railroad operations and established relationships with the Class 1 railroad officials for whom the software is intended; 3) expert linear programming skills to implement cutting-edge statistical method known as importance sampling and other mathematic methods required to optimize computer run time.</p>
<p>The additional time and cost of changing software developers at this critical stage of the project provides no benefit to the government and introduces an intolerable level of risk of project failure.</p>
<p>There is additional risk that without this software, the FRA will not be able to approve Product Safety Plans for Positive Train Control at the pace required by the Railroad Safety Act of 2008. The Act mandates quick deployment of this technology and is part of the FRA mission.</p>

<DESC>Authoring Instructional Materials (AIM) Program<br />SYNOPSIS
<p>Naval Air Warfare Systems, Orlando Training Systems Division, (NAWCTSD) in support of Authoring Instructional Materials (AIM) program, intends to issue a contract modification to Columbus Technologies and Services, Inc. (CTS), under contract number N61339-05-D-0026, on a sole source basis to one known responsible source who can meet the immediate requirement within an acceptable timeframe until the full scope of the requirement can be solicited competitively. This contract modification will temporarily extend the period of performance (POP) from 31 March 2011 until 31 July 2011. Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, this would create substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through a competition for the short-term extension of services. In addition, award to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay of work in fulfilling the agency's requirements. An acquisition strategy is simultaneously being developed to define the requirements for a competitive source selection. A Request for Proposals is anticipated to be issued on or about 16 March 2011.</p>
<p><br />This contract extension will extend the POP ensuring uninterrupted support to the AIM System Support Office (AIMSSO) for the scheduled AIM software release in August 2010, AIM Helpdesk support and AIM User Training, as well as future task orders and this will enable NAWCTSD sufficient time to recompete this requirement. Uninterrupted support to the AIM program and its user community is imperative until the recompete process is completed and transition to the newly awarded contractor occurs. The targeted award date for the recompeted contract is 7/1/2011 with a 30 day mobilization period for transition of the software packages. The four month extension of the POP will allow task orders addressing any emergent requirements to be written and will ensure proper support by the current contracted software team to the user community and AIMSOO. The ability to write task orders through 7/31/11 will also allow for planning a smooth transition to the awarded contractor as software configuration management will be a top priority in order to maintain the integrity of the AIM software code.</p>
<p><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. While interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement or submit a proposal, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses received within fifteen days after day of publication of this synopsis will be reviewed and considered by the Government. Please contact the contract specialist, Christina Garcia, with any questions or concerns: christina.garcia@navy.mil, or (407) 380-4098. The alternate point of contact (POC) is Rebeca Gonzalez, rebeca.gonzalez@navy.mil, or (407) 380-4524.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information Pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e).
<SOLNBR>N0016711I0001
<CONTACT>
<DESC>1.0 DESCRIPTION

52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).

(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

(b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.

(c) This solicitation is issued for (see 1.1 below).

1.1 PURPOSE 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) and NOT a solicitation.  NAVSEA is seeking Smart Voyage Planning (SVP) technologies suitable to improve upon current Navy Optimum Track Ship Routing (OTSR) processes in order to improve Fleet fuel efficiency while continuing to mitigate weather related hazards to safe navigation.
  Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request to industry and academia for information on architectures, approaches, products, technologies, and/or solutions for a Smart Voyage Planning Decision Aid (SVPDA). This includes information on algorithms, baseline navigation information, and sensor technologies which have the potential to meet or exceed the requirements herein.  All interested sources are encouraged to respond.

1.2 BACKGROUND
SVPDA solutions must be able to exceed current OTSR capabilities using U. S. Government furnished hydrodynamic and environmental models, Digital Nautical Charts (DNC) as well as authorized electronic navigational charts (ENC).  Routes must be capable of being developed ashore and imported into shipboard Electronic Chart Display and Information System  Navy (ECDIS-N) or ECDIS.
  Initial Operation Capability (IOC) is envisioned in the FY12 timeframe. 

1.3 CURRENT OTSR CAPABILITIES
OTSR provides recommendations for minimum time loss and circumnavigation of environmental conditions that could cause excessive pounding, rolling, pitching, crew discomfort, cargo damage or hull fatigue. Recommendations may also provide favorable areas for conducting sea-sensitive operations. OTSR also provides:

1) Recommendations for assistance/avoidance when operating in the vicinity of strong ocean currents, such as the Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream.

2) Route surveillance and recommendations for damage avoidance for voyages in more restricted waters such as the Sea of Japan, South and East China Seas, or U.S.
 coastal routes when the ship has selected the route.

The routing system provides the following at a minimum, today:

1) Route request receipt and handling.
2) Optimal route determination.
3) Ship movement monitoring and weather forecasting.
4) Generation of high winds and seas warning.
5) SURVEILLANCE, ADVISORY, and RECOMMENDATION Message formatting and transmission.
6) Management and access to ship platform information.
7) Display of situational awareness information.

1.4 SMART VOYAGE PLANNING OPEN ARCHITECTURE CONSIDERATIONS
The SVP solution architecture will be required to align and comply with the Naval Oceanography Enterprise (NOe) Enterprise Architecture (EA).  The NOe EA will assure alignment to the DON EA Hierarchy and with the priorities, principles, rules, and activities defined in the DOD Information Enterprise Architecture (DOD IEA) specification in order to assure movement to an effective net-centric solutions environment.
  Where the NOe EA does not provide adequate guidance, higher level architecture guidance specified by the DON EA Capstone and Reference Architecture Layers will need to be considered.  In addition, compliance to DOD IEA constraints and mechanisms will need to be demonstrated where interactions with the net-centric environment are indicated in the solution.  Specifically, solution architecture will need to be created that is expressed in DODAF 2.0 constructs and UML2 modeling conventions.  Vendors should review and understand the DODAF 2 Data Model (DM2) and indicate willingness to document architecture products in compliance with this model.  

2.0 DISCUSSION

2.1 TECHNICAL DISCUSSION 
The output of the SVPDA is a planned route that meets all Navy ship safety requirements, including known/charted hazards to navigation in addition to mitigating environmental hazards, and maximizes fuel efficiency while ensuring that the ship reaches its destination on or ahead of time.
   The SVPDA will be required to provide for both unclassified and classified route planning.  It must be able to accept and automatically parse MOVEREPS, identifying the intended route, date/time of arrival, and the ship class.  The ship class hull form and safety threshold values will be considered in route development as well as real time, authoritative environmental predictions for the intended route.   Additional route optimization criteria such as minimal hull stress or minimal ship motion are also desirable features.  The SVPDA will have the ability to quantify the savings from the optimized route, to include time, fuel, and risk from environmental hazards.   This route will be developed ashore and a Navy forecaster will have the ability to re-run this optimization based on additional information and/or risk tolerances.
   The format of this route will be such that, once satisfied that the route meets all requirements, the ashore component can export the optimized route in a format compatible for import into ECDIS/ECDIS-N.  Shipboard sensors and tools that can monitor onboard fuel consumption and sense the physical environment in real time would enhance the performance of a SVPDA and will be examined as part of a solution.  

2.2 INFORMATION REQUESTED 
NAVSEA is requesting that the following items (where applicable) be provided:

1. A company description and discussion of company capabilities with respect to fulfilling the objectives outlined in this RFI. 

2. A description of previous experience in the development of SVP systems.
 

3. A discussion of a SVPDA or SVP concept which has the potential to meet the performance requirements including a discussion of previous experience/accomplishments with the identified concepts and system error budgets. Available data collected on representative system platforms is also requested for analysis. 

4. A description of the proposed technology, including a discussion of the proposed concept of operations, the input hydrodynamic and environmental parameter data needed, present and future users, production quantities, and present and predicted reliability.

5. An identification of shortfalls in the proposed solution relative to the performance requirements and an approach to improving the performance to meet requirements.
 

6. Provide any additional information that will assist in understanding your responses to the RFI. 

3.0 STRUCTURE FOR RESPONSES

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point, Mechanicsburg, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dell Marketing to provide Dell, Mellanox, Samsung, QLogic, Gore, Tyco, VMware hardware, software and miscellaneous components; proposed products are for the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FLENUMMETOCCEN) in Monterey, CA. Other than Dell, there are no known sources of expertise to provide and integrate the new Dell and related equipment into the existing operational infrastructure. This infrastructure is specific to the FLENUMMETOCCEN mission. Dell has a demonstrated history as a reliable integrator at FLENUMMETOCCEN and is already familiar with the system architecture. They possess expertise in integration unique to the systems at FLENUMMETOCCEN; there is no ability to transfer this knowledge to other vendor sources.
 Fleet Numerical supercomputers are at the heart of its mission-critical operational capability and are built entirely around specific brands with software and firmware modifications for performance. FLENUMMETOCCEN has expended thousands of man hours conducting technical research, system testing, de-bugging and ensuring total suite compatibility. The use of a brand name description in this acquisition is essential to the Governments requirements, thereby precluding consideration of other hardware, software and components. The products will be procured in accordance with FAR 13.5. A firm fixed price purchase order is contemplated as the proposed contract vehicle with an anticipated award date no later than March 23rd, 2011.
 Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by closing date will be considered by the government. A determination of the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract.

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<DESC><p>The Government will issue a Draft Solicitation, SPM300-11-R-0044, which potential offerors are to review and then provide feedback / questions to the Government regarding the requirements.</p>
<p>Post Draft Solicitation issuance, DLA Troop Support intends to release a formal solicitation for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Economic Price Adjustments with a full line food distributor acting as a Prime Vendor responsible for the supply and delivery of semi-perishable and perishable items to a total of approximately 205 delivery locations (based on current troop strengths) in Afghanistan. The prime vendor must be capable of supplying all dry, chilled, and frozen products to include canned / boxed grocery products, frozen fish, meat and poultry, other frozen foods (fruits, vegetables, prepared foods, etc.), dairy and ice cream products, fresh and frozen bakery products, beverages, water, and juices (non-dispensers), fresh fruits and vegetables, and non-food items such as Food Service Operation Supplies (FSOS). In addition, the prime vendor must also be capable of storing and distributing Government Furnished Material (GFM) such as Unitized Group Rations (UGRs), Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), Health and Comfort Packs (HCPs), and Containers holding construction materials, to the military and other authorized customers within Afghanistan. The estimated dollar value for this contract is $2,000,000,000 annually, totaling $10,000,000,000 across the entire 66 month contract. The contract will be broken down into three (3) Tiered Pricing Periods. The first tier shall be for a 30 month period (inclusive of a 6-month ramp-up period followed by a 24-month performance period). The second tier shall be for the following 18-month performance period. The third and final tier shall be for another 18-month performance period. <br /><br />The prime vendor must have the ability to make deliveries by means of ground, fixed wing, and rotary wing transportation, depending upon the location of the customer, while also independently arranging for Private Security services, where necessary. There will be attachments to the solicitation, which can be requested by potential offerors. These attachments will provide current Government estimates as to which delivery points currently require Private Security. This can be used as a reference; however, offerors will be required to propose the mode of transportation they see fit for each respective delivery point, and whether Private Security services will be required for that delivery point. The prime vendor must also independently arrange for the transportation of product from the Southern Caucuses / Central and Southern Asian (SC / CASA) states into the country of Afghanistan, as no Government Contracted rates are currently available. The prime vendor will also be required to utilize Afghanistan Nationals for contract employment, and partner with Afghanistan-based and SC / CASA-based companies as part of their performance on this contract.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit questions / comments / recommendations to the Government which shall be considered by DLA Troop Support. Anticipated Issuance Date of the Draft Solicitation is 24 February 2011 with a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) date to be determined.</p>
<p>The Draft Copy, as well as the formal RFP (after issuance date) may be found on the DLA-BSM Internet Bid Board System at http:www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil or the Federal Business Opportunities sidebar. Then choose the RFP you wish to view. You must be registered in order to download RFPs. If you are not, you will be directed to register at time of download. Solicitation requests may also be transmitted via email to Lourdes.Valentin@dla.mil, Dennis.Strolle@dla.mil, or Jamie.Shuster@dla.mil or via facsimile at (215) 737-2161, ATTN: DLA Troop Support - FTAH.</p>

(a) The apparently successful offeror, unless currently listed as verified in the
Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at: www.vetbiz.gov database, shall submit to
Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) within
five business days of receipt of written notice of its status as the apparently

as necessary, establishing as follows:

 (1) The owner or owners of 51 percent or more of the offeror is/are service-disabled Veteran(s), Veteran(s), or an eligible surviving spouse thereof, as applicable, for the instant acquisition. In this regard, the apparently successful offeror shall submit a VA Form 0877 to CVE via VA's VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov.internetsite.This confidential and secure electronic application will enable CVE to inform the CO of the service-disabled Veteran or Veteran status of the owner(s) of the offeror without the CO having to receive and
secure confidential individually identifiable information or personal health care information on this topic. 

(2) Eligible parties own 51 percent or more of the concern (see 38 CFR 74.3). Adequate documentation can include copies of official stock certificates, articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, operating agreement, or other similar documentation which reasonably demonstrates the percentage of ownership by eligible parties; and

Within 21 business days, CVE shall determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision thereon to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and to the CO. The CO will use CVE decision in making the source selection decision.

(c) If a competing vendor raises a status protest prior to CVE completion of its
verification examination, the CO may rely on the status protest decision when
issued.

(d) This deviation will expire December 31, 2011. Thereafter, in accordance with

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334112. This requirement is being competed as a small business set-aside whereby Blue Arc-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.<br /><br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because this is only maintenance and support for appliances that were previously procured.<br /><br />The Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) currently runs a production environment for NIST-wide applications. These applications are deemed critical to the operation of the agency. The NIST environment currently consists of BlueArc Titan hardware and software. <br /><br />This procurement is for maintenance and support for the existing BlueArc equipment in Gaithersburg, MD and Boulder, CO. BlueArc premium 24X7 4-hour response maintenance and support for the existing BlueArc equipment is required. While BlueArc business partners and/or resellers may be able to provide this support, all service must be performed by BlueArc technical staff. A list of the exact items needed is attached.<br />Quotations shall be tailored to the exact items listed. The Contractor shall provide the items in the attached Requirements list.</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />The Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already purchased and is using BlueArc Titan hardware and software. The current NIST BlueArc environment requires that we maintain a support contract in order to diagnose system problems and to obtain and apply routine and emergency fixes to ensure that NIST is able to provide adequate application support and ensure application and data integrity. To support this effort, a service contract with BlueArc must be maintained to provide on-site maintenance within a 4 hour notice.<br /><br />Due to the proprietary nature of the BlueArc equipment, this maintenance and support must be from the BlueArc vendor. The BlueArc equipment was developed and copyrighted by and are marketed and maintained solely by the BlueArc Corporation. Only the developer has the technical expertise and access to proprietary code to provide the level of support requested and to develop and make available temporary patches to fix errors.</p>
<p>All responsible offerors that are small businesses and are Blue Arc-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below. <br />ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />Paragraph (b) below replaces paragraph (b) in provision 52.212-1.<br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on company letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must include- <br />(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(3) Technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with requirements in the solicitation. Item MUST meet exact specifications as laid out in the description attached. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;<br />(4) Terms of any expressed warranty;<br />(5) Firm-fixed price for each CLIN and discount terms;<br />(6) Acknowledgement of solicitation amendment(s);<br />(7) Include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>NIST reserves the right to award a purchase order without discussions, based solely on the submission of the Contractor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The award will be made to the responsible authorized offeror whose technically acceptable quotation is deemed to represent the lowest price. Offers that meet all of the above requirements will be deemed technically acceptable.</p>
<p>Quotations must be emailed to divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial services is in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It will be the responsibility of the offeror to check the website, http://www.fbo.gov, for the issuance of any amendments to the solicitation. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-49.</p>
<p>This requirement is set aside for small businesses under NAICS code 541712. See attached provisions and clauses. The Government will award a single award, labor hour contract. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To be eligible for contract award, an offeror must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)</span>.</strong> For instructions on registering with CCR, please see CCR's website at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work:</strong><br />USUHS has a requirement for a project that combines the development and evaluation of three data acquisition systems: (i.) a portable system for heart rate variability studies, (ii.) an upgraded EEG/event related potential system located in the Brain Synchronization Laboratory at USUHS, and (iii.) the next generation of the field deployable neuropsychiatric support system. In addition to hardware engineering, this project will also include the development and testing of data acquisition software and analysis software. A nonlinear signal classification technology that combines the resolving power of five nonlinear measures of dynamical behavior: the characteristic fractal dimension, the Richardson dimension, Lempel-Ziv complexity, the Hurst exponent and relative dispersion will be implemented as a central component of the DMRDP funded project "Identifying individuals at risk of delayed onset PTSD and depression following mild traumatic brain injury."</p>
<p>The DMRDP project addresses an urgent requirement of military medicine: in many instances individuals experiencing a mild traumatic brain injury are asymptomatic in the immediate post-injury period but subsequently present delayed onset neuropsychiatric symptoms. The object of this research program is to identify individuals at risk by analyzing psychophysiological signals (specifically EEGs, cognitive event related potentials and the electrocardiogram which is analyzed to produce measures of heart rate variability).</p>
<p>It is necessary to correlate these signals with those obtained from healthy individuals and from symptomatic patients. The central problem investigated in this research program is, therefore, a signal classification problem in which signals are classified into groups defined by control subjects, by patients presenting PTSD and by patients presenting significant depressive disorders. These signals are complex physiological waveforms and because they will be recorded in the field they will by noisy.</p>
<p>Offeror will continue with the development of the hardware and data acquisition software for the portable, heart rate variability assessment system.  The dynamical characterization of heart rate variability records will be implemented. This will include spectral measures and measures derived from dynamical systems theory. Offeror will be required to provide only labor and is expected to best past efforts in technology development.  There are no restrictions on intellectual property under this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives (Tasks):</strong><br />1. Construct and test a portable heart rate variability assessment system</p>
<p>2. Upgrade the EEG/event related potential system at USUHS</p>
<p>3. Participate in the construction and testing of the next generation portable EEG/event related potential system/neuropsychiatric support system.</p>
<p>4. Develop and test new platforms for increased portability of the Heart Rate Variability and EEG/event related potential systems.</p>
<p>5.  Perform signal analysis of participant data.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong><br />1. Quarterly reports and briefings on a schedule determined by the contracting authority will be required.</p>
<p>2. Final report</p>
<p>3. Any software created during the life of the contract</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance:</strong><br />Anticipated dates covered - March 28, 2011 to March 27, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Budget:</strong></p>
<p>Estimated total budget is likely to be between $200,000 and $250,000.Currently available funding is limited to $23,000. Additional funding will be added as they are needed and become available - most likely in December of each year. Offerors shall comment on the level of effort likely to be needed to complete this development.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications/Evaluation Factors:</strong><br />Award will be made on a best value determination considering the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>1.	Technical Approach - Offeror's methodology for performing/completing data analysis must use a nonlinear signal classification technology that combines the resolving power of five nonlinear measures of dynamical behavior: the characteristic fractal dimension, the Richardson dimension, Lempel-Ziv complexity, the Hurst exponent and relative dispersion. Offerors shall describe their method(s) of analysis. If citing named methodologies, please include a description of what it entails and how the plan will be implemented within the analysis.</p>
<p>2.	Past Performance - The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance within the past three (3) years. Offerors must provide past-performance references from past employers - if available - on contracts of similar complexity, scope, dollar amount, and type. No more than three references may be submitted. Two of the three references should include data analysis within the field of Clinical/Medical Research where the final results obtained from the data analysis were used in a peer-reviewed article published in a medical research journal. The customer references must complete the attached past performance survey and <strong>email a copy to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">noon (EST), 25 March 2011</span>. It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure past performance surveys are received by the due date.</strong> Any survey included in the quote package, but not emailed to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil will not be considered. Offerors may provide additional information to support past performance history, but not in lieu of the past performance surveys required. USUHS reserves the right to contact customer references for additional information.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a "neutral/unknown" rating for past performance. A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable past performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternate sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>3.	Experience - Offerors must provide resumes of all key personnel who will be working on this project. Offeror must demonstrate that they are a published and peer-reviewed expert in non-linear signal processing, relevant to the work required by this contract.</p>
<p>4.	Price - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Offerors must provide a labor hour price quote</span>.</strong> Offeror shall provide a fully-loaded hourly quote for each person performing work. Offered rates shall not escalate more often than every 12 months.</p>
<p>All quotation packages shall be clearly marked with the quotation number, tax identification number (TIN), DUNS number, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address (if available).</p>
<p><strong>Due Dates:</strong><br /><strong>Questions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> be submitted via email to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil</strong> <strong>by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">noon on March 11, 2011</span>.</strong> Questions submitted after this date <strong>will not</strong> be answered.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:<br />a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes.</p>
<p>Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>2. Required Delivery Date</p>
<p>3. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />Required delivery date is significantly more important than past performance and price.</p>
<p>(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all Quotations shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each Quotation strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written Quotation. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a Quotation and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Quotations, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such Quotations may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those Quotations so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of Quotations. If the two or more highest rated technical Quotations are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Quotation Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit Quotations that will be considered by the agency. Quotations must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Quotation. Quotations must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Quotations must be received no later than March 7, 2011 by 12:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. Quotations received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Quotations may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: tara.m.holloway@uscg.mil .</p>

<p>OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (GG-913)<br />Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement<br />1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

     (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments
 
     (9) The specification.
 
   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The following clause is herby referenced by full text:</p>
<p>FAR 52.211-6 - Brand Name or Equal (AUG 1999)</p>
<p>(a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. <br />(b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must- <br />(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; <br />(2) Clearly identify the item by- <br />(i) Brand name, if any; and <br />(ii) Make or model number; <br />(3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and <br />(4) Clearly describe any modifications the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications. <br />(c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. <br />(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <br />(End of provision) <br />FAR 52.211-9 - Desired and Required Time of Delivery (Jun 1997)<br />(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:<br /><br />DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />0001 12 21<br />0002 36 21<br />0003 36 21<br />If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:<br /><br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />0001 12 30<br />0002 36 30<br />0003 36 30<br />Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p><br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.215-9023 Reverse Auction (OCT 2009) <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.<br />(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.<br />(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction.<br />(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.<br />(d) Prior to the on-line auction, the Government will determine whether either all offerors' prices or just the lowest offeror's price(s) will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). If the Government opts to disclose one or more offerors' prices, only generic identifiers will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A", or "lowest priced offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.<br />(e) An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />(f) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted.<br />(1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by DLA's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.<br />(2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is available at [https://govauctions.procuri.com].<br />(3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other offerors' pricing in confidence until after contract award.<br />(4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative [insert name and contact information for designated representative] immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror's control.<br />(5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website: [https://govauctions.procuri.com]. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and Internet connection.<br />(6) Training:<br />(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means.<br />(ii) An employee of an offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a 'trained offeror.' Only trained offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that offerors provide an alternate offeror employee to become a 'trained offeror.' The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the 'trained offeror' designation from any trained offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.<br />(End of Provision)<br />DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protest (SEP 1999)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) (JUN 2001)</p>
<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ). Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />These clauses may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. Additional required clauses other than those above may be included as Addenda on the award document.</p>

<DESC>This amends the previously issued announcement for Solicitation No. N889510061 (Combined Synopsis/Solicitation).
The following changes are made to the requirement:
1.  Questions and Answers to Questions Received Thru 2/24/2011:
Q15:  The contract price schedule shows one wireless link for Building I.  Is this assumed to be a pair of wireless links or is there an existing wireless link to connect to?  What specifications are there for the wireless link, i.e., frequency, type, etc.?  If it is a pair of wireless links, where will the other end of the pair be installed?A15:  The Contract Price Schedule erroneously included a wireless link for Building I.  There is no wireless link; everything is currently hard-wired.  As such, the Contract Price Schedule has been revised to delete the wireless link.  The revised CPS entitled, "Rev2 Contract Price Schedule" can be obtained by contacting the Contracting Officer, Joelle Mascarenas at Joelle_Mascarenas@nps.gov if you are not already on the bidder's list.
Q16:  The contract price schedule shows a singular item for surge protection.  Is this meant to collectively include the control line surge protection, UPS, and any other similar types of surge protection?A16:  Yes.
Q17:  The contract price schedule shows an item labeled as Control panel, software.  We were unable to locate this item in the Scope of Work.  Can you please clarify this item?A17:  This item is included in the Scope of Work under the section entitled, "Integration of keyless entry system on 13 existing strike doors (Bldgs. D & F)", specifically related to the last bullet of the section.
Q18:  Is there existing data conduit between the three groups of buildings (Building I/Buildings G&H/A&B Complex)?A18:  Please reference the electrical drawings entitled, "Pages 1-16 from Elec Dwgs", "Pages 17-33 from Elec Dwgs", and "Pages 34-48 from Elec Dwgs".  These attachments can be obtained by contacting the Contracting Officer, Joelle Mascarenas at Joelle_Mascarenas@nps.gov if you are not already on the bidder's list.
Q19:  Can you please provide a full set of electrical drawings either in pdf form or half-size hard copy so that the proper load requirements may be calculated and the installation locations can be optimized?A19:  Electrical drawings entitled, "Pages 1-16 from Elec Dwgs", "Pages 17-33 from Elec Dwgs", and "Pages 34-48 from Elec Dwgs" are being provided as attachments.  These attachments can be obtained by contacting the Contracting Officer, Joelle Mascarenas at Joelle_Mascarenas@nps.gov if you are not already on the bidder's list.

<DESC>This is an amendment to Request for Quote (RFQ) PR-OCSPP-11-00044.
The purpose of this amendment is to change the NAICS Code to 339111, and to post the following vendor questions and Government answers:

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial services is in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It will be the responsibility of the offeror to check the website, http://www.fbo.gov, for the issuance of any amendments to the solicitation. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-49.</p>
<p>This requirement is set aside for small businesses under NAICS code 541712. See attached provisions and clauses. The Government will award a single award, labor hour contract. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To be eligible for contract award, an offeror must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)</span>.</strong> For instructions on registering with CCR, please see CCR's website at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work:</strong><br />USUHS has a requirement for a project that combines the development and evaluation of three data acquisition systems: (i.) a portable system for heart rate variability studies, (ii.) an upgraded EEG/event related potential system located in the Brain Synchronization Laboratory at USUHS, and (iii.) the next generation of the field deployable neuropsychiatric support system. In addition to hardware engineering, this project will also include the development and testing of data acquisition software and analysis software. A nonlinear signal classification technology that combines the resolving power of five nonlinear measures of dynamical behavior: the characteristic fractal dimension, the Richardson dimension, Lempel-Ziv complexity, the Hurst exponent and relative dispersion will be implemented as a central component of the DMRDP funded project "Identifying individuals at risk of delayed onset PTSD and depression following mild traumatic brain injury."</p>
<p>The DMRDP project addresses an urgent requirement of military medicine: in many instances individuals experiencing a mild traumatic brain injury are asymptomatic in the immediate post-injury period but subsequently present delayed onset neuropsychiatric symptoms. The object of this research program is to identify individuals at risk by analyzing psychophysiological signals (specifically EEGs, cognitive event related potentials and the electrocardiogram which is analyzed to produce measures of heart rate variability).</p>
<p>It is necessary to correlate these signals with those obtained from healthy individuals and from symptomatic patients. The central problem investigated in this research program is, therefore, a signal classification problem in which signals are classified into groups defined by control subjects, by patients presenting PTSD and by patients presenting significant depressive disorders. These signals are complex physiological waveforms and because they will be recorded in the field they will by noisy.</p>
<p>Offeror will continue with the development of the hardware and data acquisition software for the portable, heart rate variability assessment system.  The dynamical characterization of heart rate variability records will be implemented. This will include spectral measures and measures derived from dynamical systems theory. Offeror will be required to provide only labor and is expected to best past efforts in technology development.  There are no restrictions on intellectual property under this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives (Tasks):</strong><br />1. Construct and test a portable heart rate variability assessment system</p>
<p>2. Upgrade the EEG/event related potential system at USUHS</p>
<p>3. Participate in the construction and testing of the next generation portable EEG/event related potential system/neuropsychiatric support system.</p>
<p>4. Develop and test new platforms for increased portability of the Heart Rate Variability and EEG/event related potential systems.</p>
<p>5.  Perform signal analysis of participant data.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong><br />1. Quarterly reports and briefings on a schedule determined by the contracting authority will be required.</p>
<p>2. Final report</p>
<p>3. Any software created during the life of the contract</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance:</strong><br />Anticipated dates covered - March 28, 2011 to March 27, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Budget:</strong></p>
<p>Estimated total budget is likely to be between $200,000 and $250,000.Currently available funding is limited to $23,000. Additional funding will be added as they are needed and become available - most likely in December of each year. Offerors shall comment on the level of effort likely to be needed to complete this development.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications/Evaluation Factors:</strong><br />Award will be made on a best value determination considering the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>1.	Technical Approach - Offeror's methodology for performing/completing data analysis must use a nonlinear signal classification technology that combines the resolving power of five nonlinear measures of dynamical behavior: the characteristic fractal dimension, the Richardson dimension, Lempel-Ziv complexity, the Hurst exponent and relative dispersion. Offerors shall describe their method(s) of analysis. If citing named methodologies, please include a description of what it entails and how the plan will be implemented within the analysis.</p>
<p>2.	Past Performance - The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance within the past three (3) years. Offerors must provide past-performance references from past employers - if available - on contracts of similar complexity, scope, dollar amount, and type. No more than three references may be submitted. Two of the three references should include data analysis within the field of Clinical/Medical Research where the final results obtained from the data analysis were used in a peer-reviewed article published in a medical research journal. The customer references must complete the attached past performance survey and <strong>email a copy to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">noon (EST), 25 March 2011</span>. It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure past performance surveys are received by the due date.</strong> Any survey included in the quote package, but not emailed to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil will not be considered. Offerors may provide additional information to support past performance history, but not in lieu of the past performance surveys required. USUHS reserves the right to contact customer references for additional information.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a "neutral/unknown" rating for past performance. A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable past performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternate sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>3.	Experience - Offerors must provide resumes of all key personnel who will be working on this project. Offeror must demonstrate that they are a published and peer-reviewed expert in non-linear signal processing, relevant to the work required by this contract.</p>
<p>4.	Price - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Offerors must provide a labor hour price quote</span>.</strong> Offeror shall provide a fully-loaded hourly quote for each person performing work. Offered rates shall not escalate more often than every 12 months.</p>
<p>All quotation packages shall be clearly marked with the quotation number, tax identification number (TIN), DUNS number, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address (if available).</p>
<p><strong>Due Dates:</strong><br /><strong>Questions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> be submitted via email to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil</strong> <strong>by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">noon on March 11, 2011</span>.</strong> Questions submitted after this date <strong>will not</strong> be answered. Questions will not be answered over the telephone, but will be answered in an amendment to the solicitation posted on or about March 15, 2011. It is the responsibility of the offeror to monitor FedBizOpps for any amendments to the solicitation. All quotes and past performance surveys are due by noon EST on March 25, 2011.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team. The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, and Consequence Management. It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of MLU. These activities include military liaison and coordination, deliberate planning, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The OWL radar provides the ability to detect, track and locate mortar, cannon and rocket firing positions automatically, when fired in a variety of situations. This includes conventional indirect weapon fires, in addition to, weapons fired with non-standard trajectories. The system also has the ability to provide the location of weapons fired in mountainous terrain from elevations both above and below the radar. The OWL provides high-quality track data on mortar, cannon, and rocket targets in order to be fully capable of providing a cue for handoff to fire control systems. Additionally, the system provides quality impact point prediction with sufficient warning to improve force protection and take responsive measures in a timely manner. The system also incorporates advanced techniques for system self-protection against Electronic Attack, i.e., jamming and deception.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS SUPERCEDES THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON FEBRUARY 16, 2011.  CHANGES ARE INCORPORATED WITHIN.  THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN MOVED TO MARCH 11, 2011.  TO VIEW THE VERSION WITH TRACKED CHANGES GO TO THE EAGLE WEBSITE AT http://www.aschq.army.mil/ac/aaisdus/EAGLE.aspx.  <BR>Solicitation Number: <BR>Notice Type 	Sources Sought <BR>Synopsis:<BR>1.  Information is being collected for market research purposes and not as a request for proposal or as an obligation on part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research and will not pay for information solicited.  The purpose of this notification is to identify parties that may have interest and capability to respond to and comply with the Army's future logistics requirements as part of the emerging Enhanced Army Global Logistics Enterprise (EAGLE) contract.  Comments and questions are strictly voluntary and incorporation of comments into any future document will be at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Any information or ideas submitted to the Government may be used in formulating its acquisition strategy and any resulting solicitation.  Therefore permission to use the information for purposes of developing the acquisition strategy is inherently granted with the submission.  Proprietary data should not be submitted. <BR><BR>2. Contract Information:  The US Army Sustainment Command (ASC) assumed responsibility for operational control (OPCON) of Directorates of Logistics (DOL) supply, maintenance, transportation support, and selected ammunition supply functions within the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, on Oct. 1, 2010. In an effort to fulfill this responsibility we are conducting market research to evaluate the ability of businesses to become PRIME contractors in support of the EAGLE contract effort.  The functional areas that are covered in this effort are Materiel Maintenance (maintenance), Retail/Wholesale Supply (supply), and Transportation Support (transportation).  These services will be solicited using the NAICS code 561210, Facilities Support Services. A stand-alone Plans and Operations functional area will not be included in the proposed EAGLE contract. In the past many installations placed separate contracts for maintenance, supply, and transportation support services.  The acquisition strategy currently under consideration by ASC, intends to centralize functional responsibility, eliminate redundancy, and maximize efficiency by combining these three functions under one contract. In other words, a single contractor at each DOL installation will be responsible for providing all required maintenance, supply, and transportation support services. The installations that have requirements other than those covered under the DOL, may or may not have one single contractor performing this work.  For example, the successful contractor for the Detroit Arsenal DOL, may or may not be the same contractor performing the other potential requirements at Warren, MI.  This is the fifth sources sought notice for the EAGLE contract.  Past sources sought notices did not clearly articulate this intention. We are seeking to ascertain industry's interest and capability in providing services at specific installations using this concept.  We are particularly interested in the capability and capacity of small businesses to perform as prime contractors providing services in all three functional areas. This information will be used to determine if a portion of the total requirement is suitable for a small business set-aside. We are also considering a provision that would require large businesses submitting proposals for some requirements to team with a small business in order to be eligible for award. This requirement would be in addition to and separate from any small business setaside suite that may be identified. The requirements that would be subject to this provision and the percentage of the resulting task order subject to the teaming arrangement will be identified in the RFP but are not known at this time. A description of the teaming arrangement contemplated will be required as part of the proposal when submitted and evidence of a contractual relationship with the small business partner will be required at time of award or shortly thereafter. <BR>The functional area details are as follows:<BR>a. Material Maintenance (NAICS Code 811118*): Examples of types of work are - Installation Materiel Maintenance Activity Operations, Installation Modification Work Order and Warranty program coordination, Equipment Condition Classification, Base Operation Equipment Maintenance (i.e. construction equipment, emergency equipment, etc...)Tactical Equipment Maintenance (i.e. missile, armament, combat platforms, ground support equip), Corrosion Protection Programs, Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) program, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  <BR><BR>b. Retail/Wholesale Supply (NAICS Code 493190*): Examples of types of work are - Supply Support Activity Management (Classes of Supply include I, II, IIIP, IV, VII and IX), Central Issue Facility Operations, Individual Chemical Equipment Management Program (ICEMP), Property Accountability, Ammunition Supply Operations and Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) Management, Installation Property Book and Equipment Management, Fuel Support (CL III Bulk), Central Receiving Point, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  <BR>c. Transportation Support  (NAICS Code 488999*): Examples of types of work are - Central Travel Office, Non-tactical Equipment Management, License Equipment Operators, Railroad Operations, Household Goods Operations, Personnel & Cargo movement (Shipping and Receiving Point), Local Drayage Operations, Movement planning and Transportation Motor Pool Operations, Unit movement planning, Arrival and Departure Control Group (ADG), Installation Transportation Office, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  *Individual industry NAICS codes are identified as references only.  As contemplated, the EAGLE contract will be solicited under the Facilities Support Services NAICS Code 561210.<BR>3.  Response Requirements:  We are requesting responses in two formats.  <BR>a. The first is an attached spreadsheet that is intended to gather information about your current and recent past experience as well as your interest in future requirements. While the acquisition strategy under consideration DOES require prime contractors to be able to provide services covering all three functional areas, it DOES NOT require that you accept a contract/task order at every potential location. Therefore, we have estimated the make-up and magnitude of the services required at each installation to enable you to determine your specific areas of interest and demonstrate your capability. Our estimate by installation appears in Column I of the spreadsheet. It consists of an estimate of the predominant functional area required in terms of a percentage of the total requirement. The second part of the estimate consists of an estimate of whether the total dollar value of a combined contract/task order at each installation falls in a range of  $1M, >$1M $5M, >$5M $11M, >$11M $50M, or >$50M. For example Column I addressing Ft. Polk reads 50-74% (M) and >$50M.  This indicates that the predominant functional area is maintenance and that it is estimated that 50 to 74 percent of the total contract at Ft. Polk will consist of maintenance services. The remaining 26-50 percent is attributable to supply and transportation services required. The total estimated dollar value of all three functional areas is greater than $50 million. Columns L and M are provided to indicate teaming potential. This spreadsheet may not exceed seven pages when complete. <BR>b. The second part of the requested response is a narrative explaining your understanding of the integrated nature of the requirement and, addressing your estimated total capacity under the EAGLE contract, and providing information regarding your interest in formal teaming arrangements.  In other words, even though you have interest and demonstrate the capability to perform at 20 different installations, you may not have the capacity to perform at all twenty simultaneously. State your capacity in terms of the number of installations you can manage simultaneously and total annual dollar value. If you have no past experience at the listed installations, please address other relevant experience that supports your ability to perform under the proposed EAGLE contract.  If the current or past experience entered on the spreadsheet indicates a capacity that is less than the estimated total capacity in your narrative response, include an explanation to describe how you intend to increase your company's total capacity.  If your company's capability does not include all three functional areas, by NAICS code, an explanation of how you will provide that functional capability is also required if you intend to participate as a prime contractor. You may also use this narrative to address any necessary caveats to the spreadsheet described above. Your narrative is limited to six pages using Aerial 10 Font, single spacing, on a page size of 8 1/2" x 11".  If your response does not follow the required format or exceeds maximum allowable page count it will not be considered. <BR>4.   After you have completed the spreadsheet and the narrative described above, please submit both to the EAGLE mailbox at ROCK-EAGLE@conus.army.mil.  Your response needs to be received no later than 1600 hours Central Time on 02 11 March 2011.  <BR>

TO VIEW THE VERSION WITH TRACKED CHANGES GO TO THE EAGLE WEBSITE AT http://www.aschq.army.mil/ac/aaisdus/EAGLE.aspx.  <BR>Solicitation Number: <BR>Notice Type 	Sources Sought <BR>Synopsis:<BR>1.  Information is being collected for market research purposes and not as a request for proposal or as an obligation on part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research and will not pay for information solicited.  The purpose of this notification is to identify parties that may have interest and capability to respond to and comply with the Army's future logistics requirements as part of the emerging Enhanced Army Global Logistics Enterprise (EAGLE) contract.  Comments and questions are strictly voluntary and incorporation of comments into any future document will be at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Any information or ideas submitted to the Government may be used in formulating its acquisition strategy and any resulting solicitation.  Therefore permission to use the information for purposes of developing the acquisition strategy is inherently granted with the submission.  Proprietary data should not be submitted. <BR><BR>2. Contract Information:  The US Army Sustainment Command (ASC) assumed responsibility for operational control (OPCON) of Directorates of Logistics (DOL) supply, maintenance, transportation support, and selected ammunition supply functions within the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, on Oct. 1, 2010. In an effort to fulfill this responsibility we are conducting market research to evaluate the ability of businesses to become PRIME contractors in support of the EAGLE contract effort.  The functional areas that are covered in this effort are Materiel Maintenance (maintenance), Retail/Wholesale Supply (supply), and Transportation Support (transportation).  These services will be solicited using the NAICS code 561210, Facilities Support Services. A stand-alone Plans and Operations functional area will not be included in the proposed EAGLE contract. In the past many installations placed separate contracts for maintenance, supply, and transportation support services.  The acquisition strategy currently under consideration by ASC, intends to centralize functional responsibility, eliminate redundancy, and maximize efficiency by combining these three functions under one contract. In other words, a single contractor at each DOL installation will be responsible for providing all required maintenance, supply, and transportation support services. The installations that have requirements other than those covered under the DOL, may or may not have one single contractor performing this work.  For example, the successful contractor for the Detroit Arsenal DOL, may or may not be the same contractor performing the other potential requirements at Warren, MI.  This is the fifth sources sought notice for the EAGLE contract.  Past sources sought notices did not clearly articulate this intention. We are seeking to ascertain industry's interest and capability in providing services at specific installations using this concept.  We are particularly interested in the capability and capacity of small businesses to perform as prime contractors providing services in all three functional areas. This information will be used to determine if a portion of the total requirement is suitable for a small business set-aside. We are also considering a provision that would require large businesses submitting proposals for some requirements to team with a small business in order to be eligible for award. This requirement would be in addition to and separate from any small business setaside suite that may be identified. The requirements that would be subject to this provision and the percentage of the resulting task order subject to the teaming arrangement will be identified in the RFP but are not known at this time. A description of the teaming arrangement contemplated will be required as part of the proposal when submitted and evidence of a contractual relationship with the small business partner will be required at time of award or shortly thereafter. <BR>The functional area details are as follows:<BR>a. Material Maintenance (NAICS Code 811118*): Examples of types of work are - Installation Materiel Maintenance Activity Operations, Installation Modification Work Order and Warranty program coordination, Equipment Condition Classification, Base Operation Equipment Maintenance (i.e. construction equipment, emergency equipment, etc...)Tactical Equipment Maintenance (i.e. missile, armament, combat platforms, ground support equip), Corrosion Protection Programs, Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) program, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  <BR><BR>b. Retail/Wholesale Supply (NAICS Code 493190*): Examples of types of work are - Supply Support Activity Management (Classes of Supply include I, II, IIIP, IV, VII and IX), Central Issue Facility Operations, Individual Chemical Equipment Management Program (ICEMP), Property Accountability, Ammunition Supply Operations and Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) Management, Installation Property Book and Equipment Management, Fuel Support (CL III Bulk), Central Receiving Point, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  <BR>c. Transportation Support  (NAICS Code 488999*): Examples of types of work are - Central Travel Office, Non-tactical Equipment Management, License Equipment Operators, Railroad Operations, Household Goods Operations, Personnel & Cargo movement (Shipping and Receiving Point), Local Drayage Operations, Movement planning and Transportation Motor Pool Operations, Unit movement planning, Arrival and Departure Control Group (ADG), Installation Transportation Office, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  *Individual industry NAICS codes are identified as references only.  As contemplated, the EAGLE contract will be solicited under the Facilities Support Services NAICS Code 561210.<BR>3.  Response Requirements:  We are requesting responses in two formats.  <BR>a. The first is an attached spreadsheet that is intended to gather information about your current and recent past experience as well as your interest in future requirements. While the acquisition strategy under consideration DOES require prime contractors to be able to provide services covering all three functional areas, it DOES NOT require that you accept a contract/task order at every potential location. Therefore, we have estimated the make-up and magnitude of the services required at each installation to enable you to determine your specific areas of interest and demonstrate your capability. Our estimate by installation appears in Column I of the spreadsheet. It consists of an estimate of the predominant functional area required in terms of a percentage of the total requirement. The second part of the estimate consists of an estimate of whether the total dollar value of a combined contract/task order at each installation falls in a range of  $1M, >$1M $5M, >$5M $11M, >$11M $50M, or >$50M. For example Column I addressing Ft. Polk reads 50-74% (M) and >$50M.  This indicates that the predominant functional area is maintenance and that it is estimated that 50 to 74 percent of the total contract at Ft. Polk will consist of maintenance services. The remaining 26-50 percent is attributable to supply and transportation services required. The total estimated dollar value of all three functional areas is greater than $50 million. Columns L and M are provided to indicate teaming potential. This spreadsheet may not exceed seven pages when complete. <BR>b. The second part of the requested response is a narrative explaining your understanding of the integrated nature of the requirement and, addressing your estimated total capacity under the EAGLE contract, and providing information regarding your interest in formal teaming arrangements.  In other words, even though you have interest and demonstrate the capability to perform at 20 different installations, you may not have the capacity to perform at all twenty simultaneously. State your capacity in terms of the number of installations you can manage simultaneously and total annual dollar value. If you have no past experience at the listed installations, please address other relevant experience that supports your ability to perform under the proposed EAGLE contract.  If the current or past experience entered on the spreadsheet indicates a capacity that is less than the estimated total capacity in your narrative response, include an explanation to describe how you intend to increase your company's total capacity.  If your company's capability does not include all three functional areas, by NAICS code, an explanation of how you will provide that functional capability is also required if you intend to participate as a prime contractor. You may also use this narrative to address any necessary caveats to the spreadsheet described above. Your narrative is limited to six pages using Aerial 10 Font, single spacing, on a page size of 8 1/2" x 11".  If your response does not follow the required format or exceeds maximum allowable page count it will not be considered. <BR>4.   After you have completed the spreadsheet and the narrative described above, please submit both to the EAGLE mailbox at ROCK-EAGLE@conus.army.mil.  Your response needs to be received no later than 1600 hours Central Time on 11 March 2011.  <BR>

<DESC><p style="mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to perform a National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drugged Driving. NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>A major component of addressing the impaired driving crash risk question is determining the incidence of drivers on the road with positive blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and/or who have measurable amounts of drugs in their system. Previous research (see below) has been conducted on the incidence of impaired drivers on the road. This research project will provide current data on the incidence of alcohol-positive, and drug-positive, drivers through a national roadside survey.</p>
<p>Four "national roadside surveys" have previously been conducted (1973 , 1986 , 1996 , 2007 ) to obtain data on this issue. In these surveys, drivers were randomly selected from weekend night (and Friday day in the 2007 survey) traffic on representative roadways across the 48 contiguous United States. In the first three surveys, once the driver pulled to the side of the road, s/he was asked to provide a breath sample and to answer a few questions regarding her/his drinking and driving behavior and the current trip. In the 2007 survey, for the first time, drivers were also asked to provide a voluntary oral fluid and blood sample, and to answer questions on drug use.</p>
<p>These studies have provided critical information regarding the prevalence of alcohol-positive drivers on the road across years at various BACs, which we can examine for trends. For example, there have generally been declines in both the prevalence of drivers who are alcohol-positive, and those who are at or above the current legal limit of 0.08 g/dL in each of the surveys. Across thirty years, drivers alcohol-positive drivers on Friday and Saturday nights have decreased from 22.3% to 7.9%, and drivers who had a BAC of .08 or higher decreased from 7.5% to 2.2%.</p>
<p>Although only six years will have elapsed since the last survey in 2007, there is considerable interest in obtaining current data and it is time to conduct another roadside survey, currently planned for 2013. This survey is needed to better determine the extent of alcohol-impaired and drugged driving, to develop and allocate appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is for the study of alcohol- and drugged driving research. <br />At a minimum, the contract covers:</p>
<p>&bull; A national roadside survey(s) to estimate the prevalence of the following on the nation's roads: <br />o drivers at various BACs (blood alcohol concentrations),<br />o drivers with the presence of various (over-the-counter, prescription, and illegal) drugs in their system, and <br />o drivers with alcohol and other drugs in their system.</p>
<p>&bull; The next national roadside survey is currently planned for 2013.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of guidelines to instruct others (e.g., local jurisdictions) how to conduct a representative roadside survey.</p>
<p>&bull; Analyses of alcohol and drug data, including trend and other analyses, using data from this survey and past roadside surveys.</p>
<p>This contract may also require (these are currently optional tasks, and are not funded at this time):</p>
<p>&bull; Planning and preparation for the following national roadside survey.</p>
<p>&bull; Study(ies) related to alcohol- and/or or drug- driving. This may include:<br />o Determination of impairing effects of alcohol or drugs, for example, on driving-related skills,<br />o Problem identification on alcohol- or drugged-drivers, and/or drugs in use in the U.S.,<br />o Detection and/or apprehension of alcohol- and/or drug-positive drivers, for example by law enforcement,<br />o Analysis of impaired driving laws, for example, how they are implemented and/or used, and/or their effectiveness,<br />o Analysis of criminal justice system, for example, how drugged drivers are prosecuted or sanctioned, and/or<br />o Evaluation of alcohol- or drug-related programs, sanctions, or other countermeasures.</p>
<p>Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed sixty(60) months will be awarded. The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-11-R-00451). The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about March 15, 2011. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION <br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) to supplement existing market research conducted by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This RFI is not a request for proposals; therefore, responses to this notice will not be considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a contract. Parties that respond to this RFI are advised that the NRC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the submitting party's expense. <br /><br />PURPOSE<br /><br />The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) seeks information to determine the commercial availability and technical capabilities of qualified and responsible sources and/or Government Shared Service Providers that are currently capable of providing solutions for the potential requirements described in this RFI. The information that NRC gathers from this RFI and related market research is for planning purposes only and may be used to assist the NRC in planning an acquisition strategy if a new acquisition is deemed appropriate by NRC.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />The Federal Government placed greater demand on the security clearance and suitability process and Congress enacted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004. This act, among other legislative and OMB mandates, requires federal agencies to reduce the time it takes to conduct a background investigation and provide end-to-end automation of processes that supports determining suitability eligibility, creating adjudicative actions, and the granting of security clearances. Many Federal agencies currently experience significant delays for both Government employees and their contractors, due to out-dated processes, procedures, and technology constraints.
<p>The NRC Office of Administration (ADM), Division of Facilities and Security (DFS), Personnel Security Branch (PSB) has recognized the need to modernize their business processes, procedures, and underlying technology. This initiative will allow PSB to become a more agile program that can not only meet current requirements, but also future requirements of both internal and external stakeholder's needs. <br /><br />PSB is challenged by an antiquated personnel security background investigation system. Due to a combination of inadequate documentation and obsolete technology, PSB is struggling to meet the ever-increasing demand for faster and more efficient processing and adjudication of cases. In 2010, the NRC initiated a business process analysis and mapping effort to define the business needs and business processes for providing end-to-end automation of the background investigation and adjudication processes.&nbsp; Not only will PSB need a system to satisfy its current needs, but also will need a system to have the ability to accommodate any future requirements and forecasted demands. PSB requires a customizable solution that will be easy to implement and get off the ground quickly, yet robust enough to change and grow over time.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING A RESPONSE TO THIS RFI<br /><br />In submitting responses please do so by e-mail to michael.turner@nrc.gov, with a courtesy copy to joseph.widdup@nrc.gov, by the response date for this notice. Responses should be submitted in a format that is readable in Microsoft Office Word 2007, Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and/or Adobe .pdf format and include responses to the seven questions listed below.<br /><br />QUESTIONS FOR RESPONDENTS<br /><br />In order for NRC to learn about current commercial item offerings and capabilities for personnel security background investigation solutions, NRC strongly encourages that parties respond in writing to the questions below. Please correlate the response to the question number.</p>
<p>1. What size is your organization with respect to NAICS code 541511 (i.e. "small" or "other than small")? If your organization is a small business under the aforementioned NAICS code, what type of small business (i.e. small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a), or HUBZone small business? Specify all that apply.<br /><br />2. Does your organization currently manufacture background investigation and security clearance case management commercial item solution(s)? If so, please describe those solutions, including software, services, training, etc. and include commercial price list(s) or range of commercial prices for those commercial item offerings. These may be cloud-based or non-cloud-based solutions. <br /><br />3. Is your organization an authorized reseller/business partner for case management commercial item solutions for background investigations and security clearance commercial item solutions? If so, then please indicate what those solutions are and provide commercial price list(s) or range of prices for those commercial item offerings.<br /><br />4. Does your organization have experience as a prime contractor providing an end-to-end delivery of case management commercial item solutions for background investigations and security clearances for the U.S. (Federal) Government? If so, please provide a list of Federal Government clients, a complete description of the commercial item solution provided.

<DESC><strong>MEMORANDUM FOR POTENTIAL OFFERORS</strong>
<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

It is anticipated that the solicitation for this procurement will be posted to FebBizOpps during the week of February 14, 2011. Please visit www.fbo and search for the solicitation under NAICS Code: 531 -- Real Estate/531320 -- Offices of Real Estate Appraisers.<br /><br />Because the appraisal requirements are not yet identified, GSA looks to establish multiple-award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the following areas. (Contractors may submit proposals for multiple geographical areas, if qualified.) <br /><br />Area 1 Chicago (area bounded by the city limits of Chicago, Illinois)<br />Area 2 State of Illinois (remainder of Illinois not located within Area 1) <br />Area 3 State of Indiana <br />Area 4 State of Michigan <br />Area 5 State of Minnesota <br />Area 6 State of Ohio <br />Area 7 State of Wisconsin<br /><br />Contractors will need to be proficient in valuing the following property types: <br />&bull; General Purpose &ndash; Office, Warehouse <br />&bull; Vacant Land &ndash; Rural or Urban <br />&bull; Special Purpose &ndash; U.S. Courthouse, U.S. Post Office, Historic Properties,&nbsp; Border Stations/Land Ports of Entry <br />&bull; Mixed Use &ndash; Office / U.S. Courthouse / Retail <br />&bull; Facilities &ndash; Multiple-building complexes that may be unique or complex in nature. <br /><br />These contracts are being established to provide flexibility and convenience for GSA in the procurement of appraisal services, but GSA is not <em>required</em> to utilize these contracts for any or all appraisal service needs. Since multiple awards are anticipated for each geographical area, awardees are advised that fair opportunity will be given for all orders over $3,000.00, except for specific situations outlined in the RFP. These contracts are open to small and large business concerns. <br /><br />Each contract established will have a one-year base term with four (4), one-year renewal options. As requirements are identified, individual task orders will be competed among the multiple awardees for the associated area and award of the task order will be based on best value to the Government considering price and other price-related factors. GSA&rsquo;s appraisal activities are managed by the Portfolio Management Division (PMD) located in GSA&rsquo;s Regional Office in Chicago, but appraisal deliverables will be reviewed by both the Regional Portfolio Management Division and by GSA Central Office in Washington, DC. <br /><br />Potential offerors are advised to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at this time if they have not already done so. Those that are already registered are encouraged to verify their accounts are active and up-to-date. <br /><br />CCR is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity. Effective October 1, 2003, all Government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award. CCR can be accessed at the following URL: www.ccr.gov. <br /><br />Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of ORCA in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ALL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS MUST BE REGISTERED IN ORCA. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
