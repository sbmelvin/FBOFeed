<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Earth Surface Processes Team (USGS) has identified a need for specialized sample preparation for isotope geochemistry and geochronology.  These analytical procedures require high quality, extremely low-contamination mineral separations of trace abundances of minerals in geologic samples. The work involves (1) preparation of rock and mineral samples for geochemical and isotopic analysis, (2) use of silicate-digestion techniques, ion chromatography, and low-contamination chemical procedures to separate chemical elements, and (3) use and maintenance of separation equipment in government-owned facilities to OSHA standards, and (4) preparation of materials for shipment.  All work must be performed on-site at the USGS facility in Menlo Park, CA. SPECIFIC WORK REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES The successful contractor will: 1.	Prepare high-purity mineral separates for high precision U-Pb geochronology.  Each sample may require several minerals or multiple fractions of a single mineral, such as zircon, sphene, apatite, microcline, plagioclase, or monazite.  These may be used for Ion-Probe U-Pb dating, conventional U-Pb dating, or common Pb analysis.  Deliver separates of specified minerals, not to exceed 60 samples or 110 separations for U-Pb analysis, as completed. 2.	Prepare high-purity mineral separates for high precision Rb-Sr, conventional K-Ar, and Ar-Ar geochronology.  Each sample may require several minerals, multiple whole-rock splits, or multiple fractions of a single mineral, such as muscovite, apatite, biotite, sanidine, plagioclase, microcline, adularia, pyrite, hornblende, or other minerals.  These are used for conventional K-Ar dating, Rb-Sr isochron geochronology, or Ar-Ar incremental-heating or laser-fusion analyses.  Deliver separates of specified minerals or whole-rock splits, not to exceed 150 samples for Ar-Ar analysis and 100 samples for Rb-Sr analysis, as completed. 3.	Complete elemental separation of U, Pb, Rb, and Sr using ion chromatography of whole-rock and mineral separates.  Sample digestion and ion-chromatography must be completed in low-contamination chemistry laboratories of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park and Stanford, California.  Deliver purified elemental separations for mass spectrometry, as completed, not to exceed 250 samples for all procedures. 4.	Maintain rock processing, sample preparation, and chemical laboratory equipment in U.S. Geological Survey facilities in Menlo Park in cooperation with other operators.  Follow established Project, laboratory, U.S. Geological Survey, and OSHA standards of safety. 5.	Prepare rock samples for shipment to other facilities for further preparation, such as thin sections, X-ray analysis, etc. The Government is contemplating the award of a three year contract for these commercial services, consisting of a base year and two option years, utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 under the special authority of FAR Subpart 13.5. The USGS is aware of only one interested and capable contractor in the local geographic area qualified to complete this contract.  Therefore, the Government intends to enter into negotiations and make award noncompetitively to Dr. Charles Holdsworth of Redwood City, CA IAW FAR 13.106-1(b).  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services may submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, request for quotation 05WRQQ0091 will be made available to Dr. Holdsworth through the GPE on or about 14 April 2005. This notice and any resulting contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-02, dated 23 March 2005. For further information, please contact the contracting officer at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<DESC>A) Overview

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) requires contract personnel to support the Test, Evaluation & Quality (TE&Q) organization by performing a variety of Quality Assurance (QA) related functions in support of Technology Acquisition Management (TAM) and other Engineering.  The services required deal primarily with experienced technical and management specialists who are capable of implementing field acceptance testing of mail processing equipment and performing quality audits.

Currently TE&Q uses approximately 110 contract persons in several labor categories, funded by over 30 different financial accounts, and it is anticipated that these figures will remain viable for the duration of the initial contract term.  However, the USPS may increase or decrease the number of contract personnel at any time, and there is no guaranteed minimum number of contract employees that must be maintained.

Approximately 15% of all contract employees are domiciled at the Engineering offices in Merrifield, VA or some specific supplier’s facility.  Of all the contract employees approximately 90% travel extensively throughout the United States.  Some assignments may require less or more than 40 hours per week.  A five-day workweek is not contemplated for most assignments.  No minimum workweek is guaranteed.  At the option of the USPS, a minimum of four (4) hours may be provided for Nonresident contract person on a case by case basis when traveling to a Postal site for a field test that is unexpectedly cancelled, rescheduled or postponed.

The supplier must be able to perform recruiting, managing, invoicing, and reporting tasks as a minimum.  Training shall be provided as necessary by the supplier in order to meet and maintain personnel requirements.  Certain equipment and supplies must also be provided and maintained as specified in this SOW and subsequent Task Orders.

B)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available technical staffing and management services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process, Reverse Auction or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities. The USPS may make one or more awards to support this activity.

C)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available technical and management services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

D)  Notification to Selected Suppliers

Description
505th Command and Control Wing "Umbrella" Contract

NOTE: This effort was originally posted by Department of the Air Force, Air Force Special Operations Command, 16th Contracting Squadron, on 23 Sep 04, Reference Number RFIC2TTOE23SEP04.  That office is no longer working this project.  Interim coordination/communications will be through the 505 CCW Business Office. 

The following contains excerpts from the previous notice posted by 16 CONS and still applies:

The 505 Command and Control Wing (CCW), Hurlburt Field, Florida is in the process of examining an alternative acquisition strategy which would result in a single, comprehensive contract to support its needs for expertise in the Command and Control (C2) area as it relates to the 505 CCW mission - air and space C2 testing, training, distributed mission operations, and experimentation.     This concept is further explained below.  In order to develop sound acquisition strategies, we invite and encourage early industry participation in our efforts to conduct a successful and competitive source selection with the goal of providing the 505 CCW, its partners and customers with superior, cost-effective Advisory and Assistance Services support.  

Rules of Engagement. This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.     Any formal solicitation will be announced at a later date. The purpose of this notice is to provide an update to potential offerers on the status of the proposed Umbrella Contract initiative by the 505 CCW.  The 16th Contracting Squadron  (16CONS), Hurlburt Field, FL previously initiated an RFI on 23 Sep 04, for this requirement.  16 CONS is no longer formally involved with this action.  Until further notice all communications regarding this requirement will be conducted with and through the 505 CCW Business Office.  This effort will be delayed until a Government contracting office has been established or identified to work this requirement.  Although this project has been delayed, RFI's/Notices may be issued to keep Industry up-to-date with our efforts.  Please monitor the FedBizOpps website for further updates.  Responses to RFI's are desired but not required to participate in any subsequent solicitation.  RFI responses may be shared with industry at the Government's discretion (non-proprietary) during industry days, other dialogues, or, in a future RFI and/or RFP.  

505 CCW Background & Overview.     On March 12, 2004 the Air Force Command and Control Training and Innovation Group was re-designated as the 505 CCW.     The wing is made up of the 505th Distributed Warfare Group (DWG), Kirtland AFB, NM; the 505th Operations Group (OG), Nellis AFB, NV; and the 505th Training Group (TRG), Hurlburt Field, FL.

The 505 CCW's mission is to provide an operational air and space C2 center of excellence for the joint and coalition warfighter.     This is accomplished through initial and advanced training for Air & Space Operations Center (AOC) warfighters; Combat Air Forces C2 weapons systems operational testing; distributed mission operations combining live, virtual and constructive simulations; and development and documentation of AF operational tactics, techniques and procedures (AFOTTP) and other AOC documentation.     Additionally, the 505 CCW leads execution of CSAF's biennial Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment (JEFX).

Unique resources assigned to 505 CCW include:
1.       Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) at Kirtland AFB
2.       Combined Air and Space Operations Center - Nellis (CAOC-N) at Nellis AFB
3.       AOC Simulator at Hurlburt Field
4.       USAF Professional Control Force.

Key programs of the 505 CCW include:
1.       Exercise BLUE FLAG
2.       Exercise VIRTUAL FLAG
3.       The Operational Command Training Program (OCTP)
4.       The AOC Formal Training Unit (FTU).     


Contract Background and Objective.         Multiple GSA or other contract vehicle task orders with no integration are providing the current contract support for the 505 CCW.     Management of these contracts imposes a significant administrative burden on Government personnel. The goal of the umbrella effort is to award a single contract to an integrating contractor or team that would report to the 505 CCW Commander.     This contractor would manage all contracted efforts across the 505 CCW (to include geographically dispersed units) and would execute the strategic direction laid about by 505 CCW/CC at a reduced total overall cost to the Government.     The contractor would manage in a "centralized management/decentralized execution" fashion to ensure sub-tier Commanders had maximum flexibility within the strategic direction in which to control their efforts.     Umbrella requirement is anticipated to result in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract or contracts with task orders carried out at various locations (primarily U.S. Air Force installations) worldwide.     Current efforts would be subsumed under the Umbrella contract at appropriate points.     The value of the current efforts is approximately $150 Million with potential growth up to $300 Million.     Potential NAICS code for this effort is 541710.     Potential users of this contract may be located at Hurlburt Field, Florida; Nellis AFB, Nevada; and Kirtland AFB, New Mexico.

General Description of Services.     Services under this comprehensive contract will include, but are not limited to the following:
-       Exercise and scenario planning
-       Exercise control planning and execution
-       Database and exercise product development
-       Modeling and simulation in an AOC environment
-       Modeling and simulation of airborne C2 and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) weapons systems
-       AOC initial qualification training
-       AOC continuation training
-       AOC operational document production and maintenance
-       Resource management (to include contract funds management)
-       Web and database design
-       Special Applications Support
-       Joint Forces Exercise Support
-       Software development, maintenance and training
-       Integration of compartmented capabilities
-       Integration of C2 core systems with internal and external communication infrastructures
-       Operation and training on specific C2 equipment and systems
-       JEFX support
-       Combat Air Forces (CAF) C2 systems and processes operational test and evaluation support 

Preliminary Risk Assessment.     Risks that have been identified by the government in a preliminary assessment are listed below:
-       Transition from incumbent contractors with no perturbations of workforce
-       Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel
-       Maintaining long term C2 qualified expertise
-       Increased efficiency of contract and reduced costs
-       Smooth operations in a fee for service environment
-       Central management, but geographically diverse execution


Market Research Questions. At this time we do not have any additional questions, however a Special Notice will be posted for review.

NOTE:
RFIs will be issued throughout the acquisition process, please monitor this website on a regular basis.
Responses to RFIs requested, but not required to participate in any subsequent solicitation.
RFI responses may be shared with industry at the government's discretion (non-proprietary) during industry days, other dialogues, or, in a future RFP.

At the time of issue of the annuity policy to the Corporation, the company must provide a letter addressed to the Corporation and the employee stating that it has reviewed the agreement and required changes were made or that the agreement as of the date of issue is legally sufficient for IRS requirements.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing engineering and technical services for maintenance, enhancements and development of the Air Vehicle Planning System (APS) application for United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC), and DET 1, 608TH Air Operations Group (AOG).  APS is an air vehicle mission-planning tool with a graphical user interface and database (i.e. uses USSTRATCOM’s Enterprise Database (EDB)) capable of planning the air vehicle missions supporting USSTRATCOM and United States Air Force missions.  A sample of the air vehicles included are the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers; KC-135 and KC-10 tankers; U-2, EP-3, and RC-135C reconnaissance aircraft; Dual-Capable F-15 and F-16 aircraft; Air Launched Cruise Missiles; Advanced Cruise Missiles; and Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missiles.  APS’ approximate 6.5 million lines of software code have been developed in languages such as FORTRAN, PL/1, C, and C++.  The size of the database is approximately one terabyte.  APS provides interactive graphical displays supporting air vehicle routing; route conflict resolutions, reconnaissance objective acquisition analysis, threat and weapon effect analysis, and timing plan development.  APS interfaces with the Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), Mission Data Planning System (MDPS), and other USSTRATCOM and/or Joint systems.  The possible (or potential) enhancements are not limited to the following: improvement by modernizing and upgrading the software per the USSTRATCOM System and Technical Architecture Documents; migration toward a thin client environment; support for Theater Planning; EDB updates; reengineering to reduce legacy languages; improve performance of the application; modernization and integration with Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) Systems, transition planning functions to other DoD systems (i.e. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS)) and increase inter-operability with current and future mission planning systems.  The contractor must maintain a TOP SECRECT and Special Access Required (SAR) facility clearance with storage capacity for TOP SECRET and SAR documents and equipment.  Contractor personnel who work on APS must have a favorable SSBI within the past five years for TOP SECRET and specific SAR clearances and be cleared for SIOP/ESI and Special Compartmentalized Information (SCI)) access.

The requirement is to support the Cadet academic and hospital medical libraries.  Service must fully support the mission of both libraries and includes initial procurement and renewal of approximately 1600 periodicals, institutional memberships, and specialized serials as specified in the attached Statement of Work.  In addition, the vendor’s automated system must interface with the libraries’ automated system to provide numerous services as specified in the attached Statement of Work.

This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested companies who feel they meet the requirements identified must submit a detailed capability package by the date and time identified herein for consideration.  If no response is received by 15 April 2005, 12:00PM Noon, MDT, to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining supplies and/or services through a sole source procurement with Ebsco Subscription Services, a sole source award will be made.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to procure, on a competitive basis, 450 Left and 450 Right Sparrow RIM-7 BSU-64/B Wing Assemblies, 850 BSU-63/B Fin Assemblies and 225 Containers.  The Government intends to award a contract for the production of these components for the RIM-7 Sparrow Missile on a firm fixed-price basis.  The RIM-7M Sparrow is a radar-guided (semi-active), air-to-air missile with a high explosive warhead.  The missile system provides an all-weather, all altitude operational capability and can attack high performance aircraft and missiles from any direction.  The missile utilizes an annular blast fragmentation warhead, a solid propellant rocket motor, Guidance Section, Control Section, and folding wings and clipped fins.  The wing is approximately 16 inches high and the base of the wing is 17.7 inches long and consists of a high strength aluminum casting with both chemical conversion coating and film treatment.  The wing also consists of wing tip ballast manufactured from tungsten alloy and a preloaded rod assembly.  The fin is approximately 8.4 inches high and the base of the fin is 18.1 inches long and consists of aluminum alloy forging with chemical conversion coating.  The folding wings and clipped fins are used to accommodate the dimensions of the launcher cell.  The Wing and Fin Assembly requirements have tooling and test equipment costs that must be incurred by a company that does not have the specific equipment.  A First Article Test requirement is mandatory for hardware not previously qualified by the Navy.  The technical data package (TDP) for the Wing and Fin Assemblies and Container is UNCLASSIFIED.  Offerors must request a copy of the TDP from the Sparrow Technical Office located at Naval Air Warfare Center-Weapons Division (NAWC-WD), China Lake, California by contacting Ms. Coy A. Milsap (760) 939-1908 or email coy.milsap@navy.mil.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage on or about 21 April 2005 and will close approximately 30 days after issuance.  The RFP will only be made available via the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select “Doing Business” And “Open Solicitations”.  All amendments will be posted at the same Internet website.  Hard copies of the solicitation and amendments will not be mailed to contractors.  After RFP release, vendors should regularly access the website to ensure that they have all amendments.  All responsible, small-business sources listed under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 336419 may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The Government will not accept electronic proposals.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: Registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as a Small Business under NAICS code 336419 will be a prerequisite for receiving an award.  For more information on the CCR, refer to the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.  The POC is Mr. Daniel J. Knapp, phone (301) 757-7057, or email daniel.knapp@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Raytheon Company of McKinney, Texas to develop and acquire a Periscope Detection Radar (PDR) capability designated as Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD).     The ARPDD will replace the legacy Periscope Detection (ASW) mode of the AN/APS-137D(V)5 radar incorporating Government-developed ARPDD technology within the existing radar footprint.     The ARPDD will provide the Fleet with a greatly enhanced periscope mode that automatically detects and discriminates submarine periscope/communication/Electronic Support Measures (ESM) mast exposures, with low false alarms, and alerts the operator, to maximize mission effectiveness without degrading legacy radar modes. The ARPDD program will incorporate a proven and tested technology that has been previously demonstrated in an aircraft environment to the extent possible. The ARPDD system architecture shall align with the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) and the P-3C AIP weapon system as required to deliver a fully integrated capability, including support for requisite Information Assurance and Net-Ready requirements.     In addition, associated ground-based training system and logistics support will be updated to address ARPDD.     It is contemplated that a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract with a base year and four one-year options will be awarded to develop, integrate, test, and deliver ARPDD, including two Engineering Development Models (EDMs) and four Test Articles (TAs), and options for Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units up to the approved quantity, as well as training, logistics support assets, and technical data as required. 

Raytheon is the original designer and manufacturer of the AN/APS-137D (V) 5 radar and also the ARPDD upgrade prototype. This procurement will integrate the upgrade into the production radar and address any obsolesce issues as well as incorporate system improvements resulting from advances in technology.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS FOR STUDENT LABORATORY SERVICES TO BE HIRED ON A CONTRACT BASIS BY THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.  The solicitation number is U2B669 (RFQ-RT-05-00118).   The Ecological Exposure Research Division (EERD), within the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), Office of Research and Development (ORD), United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is seeking a student with two or more years of college education, with at least two classes or experience in the area of computer programming, to provide services  under a contractual agreement in support of a EERD intranet database implementation project.  The preferred student will have experience and/or training in relational databases, web form development, and knowledge and experience with Linux, Apache, PERL and/or MySQL. The EERD develops suites of  biological indicators to describe the condition of watershed ecosystems. The Division also develops indicators to quantify the extent, magnitude and sources of exposure of ecosystem components to chemical, biological and physical stressors.  The Division conducts laboratory and field studies aimed  at providing research products that enable the EPA to conduct predictive and retrospective exposure assessments.  These studies result in the generation and/or collection of a large number of physical samples of many different types that undergo scientific analyses.  Samples are often stored until  processed and/or archived for potential future use.  Samples may include aquatic organisms and tissues, waters and sediments, sub-samples generated from processing Aparent@ samples (e.g., extracted RNA from some tissue), etc. etc.  In order to effectively manage the samples and associated data, a  relational database with a web-browser interface is being developed. The student contractor will be mentored directly by the lead developer of the database, and will also work with a variety of EPA technical staff.  The following are the main tasks which the student will work on: A large number  (estimated to be approximately 10,000) of legacy samples exist in various storage locations in Cincinnati=s Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center.  The database will need to be populated with these legacy samples.  The student contractor  would be responsible for this activity, and  would be expected to interact with scientific staff in order to ensure that existing sample archives are properly identified and catalogued in the database.  The student contractor may also play a primary role in developing templates required by various users so that they can use the database  effectively from their web browsers, so that Acurrent@ samples and data are captured in the database on an on-going basis.  The database is designed to be flexible so that it can accommodate samples and data arising from many different types of scientific study.   The student contractor would  conduct (or be part of) work flow and needs analyses with users in order to develop customized templates that provide the most effective interfaces possible for end users. If time is available after completing the previously outlined  activities, the student may be required to develop user  documentation for the database system so that future users can take the model system, install it on their own server(s), and customize it to suit their own needs.  This would be done in consultation with the student contractor's mentor, end users, and other EPA staff involved with the database  project. The student contractor will be expected to keep accurate and complete records of the work performed.  While carrying out any of their activities, the student would be responsible (to the extent possible) for addressing unanticipated implementation issues and/or other problems that may  arise, again with assistance/input from their mentor and other EPA staff. Work will begin on or about June 13, 2005, and will typically occur between the hours of 6:30 A.M. and 6:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.  The work location is at the EPA's Andrew W. Breidenbach Research Center, 26. W. Martin  L. King Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio. The initial contract will be for a period of one year, with the potential for renewal of up to an additional year, at the concurrence of both the student contractor and the Government. Initially, the student contractor would likely work full-time, with a possible  adjustment of the student's work schedule to part-time (approximately 20 hours a week) in fall, 2005.  Other scheduling arrangements may be made depending on the selected student contractor's exact situation however, over the course of the year it is desired that the student work in total  approximately 1,560 hours.   Divided evenly over 52 weeks, this is approximately 30 hours/week. The rate of hourly compensation for this position is $12.76.  Included in these figures is the cost of self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare.  Students are paid only for hours worked  (regardless of the reason for missed work) and receive no holiday or leave benefits, or overtime premiums.  Federal, State, Local, and Social Security taxes will not be withheld; student contractors are responsible for reporting income to authorities and paying all taxes. All questions are to be  forwarded via email to the Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address:  clausen.rebecca@epa.gov.   Interested parties should review all material relevant to the requirement at the following EPA website address:  http://www.epa.gov/oamrtpnc/q0500118/index.htm.  These solicitation documents  will be posted to that website 15 days after issuance of this pre-solicitation synopsis.  Interested parties should go to the website to check the status of this procurement and to ascertain when and if any amendments have been issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) W58RGZ-05-R-0005 to conduct a full and open competitive procurement for the U.S. Army's Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) requirements. The ARH will utilize Non-Developmental Item (NDI) aircraft and associated support equipment to conduct armed reconnaissance to fight for actionable combat information to enable joint/combined air-ground maneuver execution of mobile strike, close combat, an d vertical maneuver operations across the full spectrum of military operations.  The ARH will provide precision capability through lethal organic fires, dynamic employment of joint networked fires, and responsive target acquisition/identification for full spectrum, day and night operations; be rapidly deployable for global employment against a distributive, highly adaptive threat on an asymmetrical battlefield employing conventional and unconventional methods; enable the air-ground maneuver commander to 'se e-understand-act first' with a warfighter-in-the-loop to provide proactive decision making, assure critical reaction time and maneuver space, and set the conditions for the joint/combined air-ground maneuver team to 'finish decisively'.   A best value approach will be used in the source selection process.  The Government anticipates that the contract award will include an initial Cost Plus Incentive Fee effort for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase with Firm Fixed Price Op tions for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).   A copy of the RFP and unclassified supporting documentation may be accessed via the internet on or about November 23, 2004 at https://wwwproc.redstone.army.mil/ acquisition/ current_business.html.

Requests for individual electronic or paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted.    In addition, the ARH Program Office has established an informational website at https://arh.redstone.army.mil.  To access the ASK ARH section of the website, you must have a login and password.  The login/password may be requested at peoavnpoc@peoavn.redst one.army.mil. or by  mail to PEO Aviation, ARH  Project Office, SFAE-AV-ARH,  Building 5681, Room 151, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898, Attn: Business Manager, fax (256) 313-4346. The following information must be provided: Name of contractor representative; D ate of Birth; Place of Birth; Citizenship; Position/Title; Company CAGE Code; Clearance Level; Clearance Type; Clearance Date; Issued By; Purpose  (to request access to ARH website); Signed/Verified by the Facility Security Officer.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command in conjunction with the Joint Improvised Device (Defeat) Task Force (Joint IEDD-TF) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a modification to contract W9113M-04-C-0012 performed by Wexford Group Int ernational (WGI).  This action will sustain and enhance the integration of the integration of the Joint IED TF in the analysis, assessment and training for counter IED operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, as well as the preparation of units sche duled for rotation into the overseas Areas of Responsibility.  The effort to be performed under this theater of operations is in direct support of Operational forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The U.S. Army Chief of Staff (CSA) directed the Army G3 to devel op a response in support of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) efforts to mitigate and or defeat the emerging Improvised Explosive Device phenomenon.  In late 2003, the Army created the IED Task Force led by a flag officer to respond to the IED problem.  R ecently, this task force was redesignated the Joint IED Defeat Task Force by direction of the Deputy SECDEF and was tasked with the mission of focusing all available DOD resources to counter this threat.  Given this directive, sustaining the existing contr act support vehicle is essential to avoid inflicting significant harm to the government by unnecessarily forcing a suspension of contractor support and diminishing the overall counter-IED effort.   WGI personnel have established themselves as the CENTCOM s ubject matter experts in dealing with the IED threat.  In CONUS, WGI provides significant training support to deploying units. Field Team members continually rotate back to CONUS and directly share the knowledge they have gained in theater with these deplo ying units. The relationship between the Field Teams and the Training Assistance Teams is interdependent and is directly correlated to the visible success in reducing the mortality rate among friendly forces.  To incur any break or disruption to the relati onship between the Training Assistance Teams and the Field Teams is an unacceptable risk, and will most certainly  result in a  fragmented training program.  WGI possesses the needed expertise in the areas of counterinsurgency (CI) and counter terrorism (C T) and is the thread that ties this approach together.  If a different support contractor were to be introduced at this juncture, an unnecessary interruption or delay would result for the schedule and performance of the Joint IED-D TF mission.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Soldier System Center has a requirement for groundwater remediation located near various buildings on Kansas Street, Natick, Massachusetts. The Contractor will be responsible for fully executing the fixed Price Remediation (GFPR) approa ch under a Performance-Based Contract (PBC) at the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center (SSC), Natick, Massachusetts.  Soldier System Center is a 78-acre military research and development facility, surrounded on three sides by Lake Cochituate State Park, and o n the fourth by a residential neighborhood.   Soldier System Center was proposed for the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1993 due to chlorinated organic compounds contamination at the Building T-25 area. The Installation was placed on the NPL in 1994, primarily due to groundwater concentrations of t richloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in groundwater beneath the T-25 Area.  A pump and treat system was installed in 1998, to control the movement and reduce detection levels of the plume.  To date, this on-post facility has processed over 130 million gallons of water.  The treatment system is proving effective for reducing concentration at the source area by approximately 80% and limiting further contaminant migration off-post.  A final T-25 Groundwater Record of Decision (ROD) was signed i n September 2001.  The ROD requires the Army to maintain the on-post treatment system, monitor the groundwater and establish institutional controls.  Two additional areas of groundwater contamination at SSC were subsequently identified.  Groundwater beneath Building 36 and Building 22 was determined to be contaminated with PCE at concentrations of up to 600 PPB.  The extent of the plume now extends from  Building 36 to Building 22 and discharges into Lake Cochituate on the south and west sides of the peninsula.  A draft remedial investigation (RI) was started in FY00 to delineate the contamination. A draft Feasibility Study report was submitted to USEPA i n October 2004.  Groundwater at the former post drinking water wells was determined to be contaminated with TCE.  The wells were removed from service in 1995.  During the Site Investigation, a plume of TCE contamination up to 150 PPB was identified from Bu ilding 2 which discharges to Lake Cochituate south of Buildings 63 and 45.  A draft Site Investigation Report is in process.   The performance objectives of this PBC include: Continue RA(O) activities in accordance with the T-25 Area ROD generally consisting of operation and maintenance and groundwater quarterly monitoring; Design, construct and implement a remedial action at the Building 22 & 36 area in accordance with the Draft FS such that the action is operating as planned in the remedial design;  Complete the RI/FS reports, design, construct and implement a remedial action at the Buildings 63, 2 & 45 area such that the action is operating as planned in the remedial design; and, Complete all CERCLA 121(c) reviews required for the sites identified above, starting with the first review after 2006, for the duration of the contract.  Copies of the solicitation and Statement of Work will be available for download on our website: https://www3.natick.army.mil, click on business opportunities, then click on ongoing acquisitions, then click on the solicitation number, then go to files avail able for download. The solicitation will be available on the web page on or about 22 April 2005. No hard copies of the solicitation will be available.

<RESPDATE>041205
<CONTACT>Mark Hendrickson - 360-315-3209
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (0003) is to clarify the procurement procedures and to answer vendor questions. A.  This procurement is for a sole source procurement of the following brand name product:  Manufacturer – Omni Thruster, Inc. 2201 Pinnacle Parkway, Twinsburg, OH 44087-2367.  Model Number:  HT600  Thruster.  The model includes the descriptive items included in the original combined synopsis/solicitation.  Numbered note 22 applies. B.  The following are answers to vendor questions: 1) Question:  Do you need a 360 degree bow thruster?  Answer: A 360 degree is not an efficient type nozzle for our application.  We require a bow-thrust type system. 2)  Question:  If the answer to the first question is yes then we need to know. 	a) Question:  What is the size of your vessel ? 	Answer: 186 feet, 1200 tons. 	b)  Question:  What is the draft of your vessel?  	Answer: 10 feet. 	c)  Question:  How much space do we have to install our unit?   	Answer:  In between the torpedo tubes the clearance is approximately 32”.  The height is approximately 77-3/4”; width of butterfly valves is approximately 77”; diameter is approximately 60” overall. 	d) Question:  What performance are you looking for? (Thrust in Bollard Pull in what direction) 	Answer:  9500 lbs, port and starboard. 	e) Question:  Mission of the ship and turning characteristics.  	Answer:  U.S. Military Research & Development and Test & Evaluation of underwater vehicles. 3)  Question:  Re 600 Hp at 678 RPM:  We assume this is continuous rating and refer to impeller power and speed.  Please confirm.     Answer: Yes you are correct.  		  4)  Question:  What is required bearing life?      Answer:   Overall 20 years. 5)  Question:  Please clarify meaning of "thrust directions, parallel shaft".       Answer:  Thruster and motor are both vertical apposed to right angles. 6)  Question:  Re "Sumitomo gear"     a)  Question:  Is this intended as sole source for gear supplier, i.e., Somitomo in Japan?          Answer:  Yes.     b)  Question:  Is the gear external or internal to bow thruster assembly?          Answer:  The gear box couples to the thruster and motor.     c)  Question:  Do you really mean "2.600:1 exact ratio?"  If yes, this is not recommended practice, i.e., no hunting tooth.          Answer:  Yes. 7)  Question:  Please clarify meaning of port and starboard flanged mitered spool pieces.       Answer:  This is part of the structural piping from the bow thruster to port and starboard directional vanes. 8)  Question:  What is required motor RPM?      Answer:  678. 9)  Question:  Bow thruster specification appears to be written to describe a specific (sole source?)manufacturer's product.  Which manufacturers do you intend?        Answer:  Omni Thruster , Inc.      Question:  What is required diameter?      Answer:  60 inches.  10)  Question:  We assume that motor is intended to be constant speed continuous duty, non-Reversing and that bow thruster is to be controllable pitch type.  Please confirm.

<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the March 2005 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-27.  This acquisition is NOT small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 923120.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional support services for the National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR) on a sole source basis from the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH).  NICHSR plans to provide support to ASPH to update and improve the functionality of the Distance Learning Information contained in ASPH's website.  The purpose of this agreement is to strengthen and direct the pipeline leading to a well-trained public health workforce.  The schools of public health serve as an educational resource to the public health community, and since public health content is constantly evolving, lifelong education is crucial to those working in public health.  Education in the form of distance learning is particularly valuable to these professionals, because they are geographically widespread and in need of flexible learning systems that can be scheduled around other professional commitments.  ASPH has developed and supported several modes of working with the schools of public health in the area of distance learning to support and advance the mission of providing quality distance learning within the schools.  These include: 1) Establishment of Academic Distance Learning Coordinators (ADLCs), comprised of one representative at each school who focuses on distance learning and its issues; 2) Support of the ASPH Distance Education (DE) and Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Councils, who meet annually to discuss issues of distance learning in public health, and whose core members are Academic Distance Learning Coordinators.  VALUATION CRITERIA:  The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration over price or cost factors.

Statement of Work

I. 	Introduction

A. 	Background/Need

The Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) is the only national organization representing the deans, faculty, and students of this nation's 36 accredited Schools of Public Health (SPH), and the graduate programs in public health seeking accredited school status in North America. These schools have a combined faculty of over 3,000 and educate more than 15,000 students annual from every state in the U.S. and most countries throughout the world. The schools graduate approximately 5,000 professionals each year.
Increasingly, as one component of an effort to strengthen and direct the "pipeline" leading to a well-trained public health workforce, active partnerships are being formed between SPH, and state and local public health entities. SPH also serve as an educational resource to the public health community, and since public health content is constantly evolving, lifelong education is crucial to those working in public health.  Education in the form of distance learning (DL) is particularly valuable to these professionals, because they are geographically widespread and in need of flexible learning systems that can be scheduled around other professional commitments. Finally, as numerous studies have documented, much of the public health workforce lacks formal training, and an even greater number lack graduate public health degrees, making Master of Public Health (MPH) and certificate programs available at a distance especially important. 
With the influx and improvement of distance learning techniques and technologies, more and more SPH have been making education and training programs available to learners at a distance.  Currently, one third of the accredited schools of public health offer a Master of Public Health program that can be earned either partially or completely at a distance, and many more offer certificate programs in various content areas. Again, this education is especially important to those in the public health workforce seeking continuing professional education, in particular degrees or certificates.
Over time, as distance learning has become more prevalent at the SPH, ASPH has developed and supported several modes of working with the schools in the area of distance learning to support and advance the mission of providing quality DL in the SPH.
These include:
"	Establishment of Academic Distance Learning Coordinators 
(ADLC), comprised of one representative at each school who focuses on DL and its issues, 
"	Support of the ASPH Distance Education (DE) and Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Councils, who meet annually to discuss issues of DL in public health, and whose core members are Academic Distance Learning Coordinators,  
"	Design and development of a section devoted to DL programs at SPH on the ASPH website.
Originally created in 2000, with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the primary purpose of the ASPH DL web pages was to provide a comprehensive listing of SPH-developed DL training programs to public health workers interested in obtaining an MPH or certificate, or participating in specific courses, available from SPH via distance learning.
The DL section of the ASPH site currently features general information on DL and a page for each SPH to describe its DL programs.  The information on the DL pages is searchable at a broad level, using the global ASPH search engine.  Two downloadable documents containing an outline and a brief overview of MPH programs available at a distance are also accessible on the site.  This information on DL programs has proven to be consistently popular among ASPH constituents, especially professionals seeking further education.
The DL section of the website was designed to enable each school to maintain their own information.  Each Academic Distance Learning Coordinators (ADLC) has access to a back-end administrative site with which to manage and update information.  However, evidence has shown that this approach has had mixed success.  Staffing changes within schools in the Academic DLC position and a steady increase in the number of ASPH members has resulted in a section that is not always current. Because this information is in such demand, it is especially important that its validity can be trusted. 
Although analysis of the website has shown that the DL section is frequently visited, feedback from visitors has indicated that the web pages can be frustrating to use.  In particular, the current search engine does not allow for searches on variables of interest such as DL format, or content area, except at a very broad level.  A dedicated search feature focused specifically on DL programs would greatly improve the site's usability.  
More information regarding the ASPH DL site was gathered during the November 7th 2004 meeting of the ASPH Distance Education Council, composed of representatives from the SPH particularly informed on DL--primarily Academic Distance Learning Coordinators.  During this meeting feedback was gathered on: the importance of the site to SPH, obstacles to regular posting of information on the site by SPH, and the role of the SPH in maintaining the site's data, among other issues.  Input was as follows:
"	SPH see their DL programs as crucial tools for "increasing 
access to students who might not otherwise be served." 

"	Because of this, SPH definitely want ASPH to continue 
supporting and hosting the DL site, and emphasized the 
need to keep it current.

"	SPH representatives wanted to continue being involved in 
the process of updating the information on the site, and are anxious to begin such updates, but agreed that ASPH should have a guiding hand in ensuring regular updates.

"	An improved search engine on the DL site, devoted to the searching of DL programs, is a definite priority.

"	ADLC see the posting of individual courses on the ASPH site 
as problematic because of frequent fluctuation, instead, SPH supported developing a mechanism on the site indicating which programs do or do not have individual DL courses available for non-degree seeking students. Site users could then be directed to the SPH for detailed information on what is available, scheduling, fees, registration, etc.
B. 	Purpose and Objective
The overall goals of this project are to update the information provided on the DL section of the ASPH website and to improve the functionality of the site. This will provide one place where any member of the public health workforce may go to find information about classes/training necessary to help them in their job. This will be accomplished by the following five objectives:
"	Work with the Academic DLCs to update the information on the website
"	Evaluate the current data elements collected about DL programs, as well as representation of all current accredited and associate SPH, a total of 42 schools, and revise as needed.
"	Create a system to ensure that information on the website is kept current
"	Develop an improved search engine to allow users to more easily use the website.
"	Market the website to web areas frequently accessed by public health workers.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS FOR STUDENT LABORATORY SERVICES TO BE HIRED ON A CONTRACT BASIS BY THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.  THIS AMENDMENT 1 TO THIS SYNOPSIS CORRECTS THE PAY RATE TO $13.19 PER HOUR.  The solicitation number is U2B669 (RFQ-RT-05-00118).   The Ecological Exposure Research Division (EERD), within the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), Office of Research and Development (ORD), United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is seeking a student with two or more years of college education, with at  least two classes or experience in the area of computer programming, to provide services under a contractual agreement in support of a EERD intranet database implementation project.  The preferred student will have experience and/or training in relational databases, web form development, and  knowledge and experience with Linux, Apache, PERL and/or MySQL. The EERD develops suites of biological indicators to describe the condition of watershed ecosystems. The Division also develops indicators to quantify the extent, magnitude and sources of exposure of ecosystem components to chemical,  biological and physical stressors.  The Division conducts laboratory and field studies aimed at providing research products that enable the EPA to conduct predictive and retrospective exposure assessments.  These studies result in the generation and/or collection of a large number of physical  samples of many different types that undergo scientific analyses.  Samples are often stored until processed and/or archived for potential future use.  Samples may include aquatic organisms and tissues, waters and sediments, sub-samples generated from processing Aparent@ samples (e.g., extracted RNA  from some tissue), etc. etc.  In order to effectively manage the samples and associated data, a relational database with a web-browser interface is being developed. The student contractor will be mentored directly by the lead developer of the database, and will also work with a variety of EPA  technical staff.  The following are the main tasks which the student will work on: A large number (estimated to be approximately 10,000) of legacy samples exist in various storage locations in Cincinnati=s Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center.  The database will need to be populated  with these legacy samples.  The student contractor  would be responsible for this activity, and would be expected to interact with scientific staff in order to ensure that existing sample archives are properly identified and catalogued in the database.  The student contractor may also play a  primary role in developing templates required by various users so that they can use the database effectively from their web browsers, so that Acurrent@ samples and data are captured in the database on an on-going basis.  The database is designed to be flexible so that it can accommodate samples and  data arising from many different types of scientific study.   The student contractor would conduct (or be part of) work flow and needs analyses with users in order to develop customized templates that provide the most effective interfaces possible for end users. If time is available after  completing the previously outlined  activities, the student may be required to develop user documentation for the database system so that future users can take the model system, install it on their own server(s), and customize it to suit their own needs.  This would be done in consultation with the  student contractor's mentor, end users, and other EPA staff involved with the database project. The student contractor will be expected to keep accurate and complete records of the work performed.  While carrying out any of their activities, the student would be responsible (to the extent  possible) for addressing unanticipated implementation issues and/or other problems that may arise, again with assistance/input from their mentor and other EPA staff. Work will begin on or about June 13, 2005, and will typically occur between the hours of 6:30 A.M. and 6:00 P.M., Monday through  Friday.  The work location is at the EPA's Andrew W. Breidenbach Research Center, 26. W. Martin L. King Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio. The initial contract will be for a period of one year, with the potential for renewal of up to an additional year, at the concurrence of both the student contractor and  the Government. Initially, the student contractor would likely work full-time, with a possible adjustment of the student's work schedule to part-time (approximately 20 hours a week) in fall, 2005.  Other scheduling arrangements may be made depending on the selected student contractor's exact  situation however, over the course of the year it is desired that the student work in total approximately 1,560 hours.   Divided evenly over 52 weeks, this is approximately 30 hours/week. The rate of hourly compensation for this position is $13.19.  Included in these figures is the cost of  self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare.  Students are paid only for hours worked (regardless of the reason for missed work) and receive no holiday or leave benefits, or overtime premiums.  Federal, State, Local, and Social Security taxes will not be withheld; student contractors are  responsible for reporting income to authorities and paying all taxes. All questions are to be forwarded via email to the Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address:  clausen.rebecca@epa.gov.   Interested parties should review all material relevant to the requirement at the following EPA  website address:  http://www.epa.gov/oamrtpnc/q0500118/index.htm.  These solicitation documents will be posted to that website 15 days after issuance of this pre-solicitation synopsis.  Interested parties should go to the website to check the status of this procurement and to ascertain when and if  any amendments have been issued.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to modify Contract Number M67854-05-D-2002 with Lockheed Martin Corporation, Maritime Systems & Sensors, Electronics Parkway, Syracuse, NY 13221-4840 to procure an additional AN/TPS-59 Three-Dimensional Long-Range Radar System.  The current contract is for the maintenance, sustainment, and modernization of the existing eleven AN/TPS-59 systems; however, the Marine Corps is anticipating supplemental funding for the procurement of a twelfth system in FY05.  The AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System is a lightweight, transportable, long-range, solid state, 3-D L-Band radar.  The radar can be integrated as an automatic surveillance radar with either the AN/TYQ-23(V)1, or the AN/TYQ-23(V)4, as the principal sensor of the TAOC.  It may also be configured to operate with the Air Defense Communications Platform (ADCP) to provide TBM cueing to TADIL-J capable weapons systems.  The AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System, was developed and built by Lockheed Martin and fielded in 1998.  It is the only tactical system capable of detecting, tracking, and providing weapons cueing information on short, medium, and long range Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  Lockheed Martin is considered the only source capable of meeting this requirement.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement.  No telephonic requests will be accepted.  All communications shall be in writing to the Contracting Officer and will only be used to consider whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>Modified the notice as follows: Extend the geographic restriction north from Vicksburg, MS to Memphis, TN.  

The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HubZone or Small Business concerns only.  The estimated value of this procurement is between $75,000.00 and $200,000.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The NAICS Code is 336611.  The performance period will be 36 calendar days with a start date on or about August 8, 2005.  The acquisition is for Dry-dock Repairs to the ANB CG643503 at the contractor’s facility. The boat’s home pier is Colfax, LA.  The following geographic restriction applies. The boat is restricted within the Lower Mississippi River and Port Allen Waterway between mile marker 80 to mile marker 438. This area encompasses the Ports of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, LA on the southern end and Vicksburg, MS to the north. No open water transits.  Size, configuration, and endurance limit the sea conditions and transit distances that can be negotiated safely.  This work will include, but is not limited to welding repairs, clean and preserve forward ballast tank and void, clean sewage holding tanks, clean fuel tank, remove, inspect, and reinstall propeller shaft, straighten shaft, realign main engine/reduction gear, clean, inspect, and test grid coolers, renew shaft stern tube bearing and inspect strut bearing, remove, inspect and reinstall rudder, remove, inspect and reinstall propellers, perform minor repair and recondition of propeller, renew valves, inspect and overhaul chain stopper, preserve spuds and spud wells, preserve buoy deck, preserve underwater body, routine dry-docking, preserve freeboard, perform non-destructive testing of pad eyes, renew cathodic protection system, provide temporary logistics, renew deck covering systems, modify capstan piping, and repair buoy port.  Trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures, shall accomplish all welding and brazing.  In accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUB Zone certified, or in accordance with FAR 19.502-2 (b) (1),  if your firm is a Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to jsnyder@mlca.uscg.mil  or by fax (757) 628-4676. Questions may be referred to Mr. Jay Snyder at (757) 628-4642.  In response please include the following: (a) a positive statement of your intent to submit a quote for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contacts and phone numbers.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUB Zone set aside, FAR 52.219-3 Notice of Total HUB Zone set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUB Zone small business concerns. Your response is required by March 28, 2005.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUB Zone set aside or a Small Business set aside.   Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a Hub Zone small business set aside, a Small Business set aside, or on an unrestricted basis will be posted on the FedBizOps website at http://www.eps.gov.

<SUBJECT>B -- Consultant services for data analysis on a higher education issue
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-EDOOCR-05-900066
<RESPDATE>042005
<ARCHDATE>05052005
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct and clarify the Department's requirement for consultant services for data analysis on a higher education issue.  The intent of the original notice was to disseminate information on a proposed contract action in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(2).   As such, the following additional information, which better satisfies the requirements of FAR 5.207(c), is being made available.    In order to assist ED/OCR in its efforts to complete OCR Case No. 06032021 to determine if the State actions in Oklahoma were inconsistent with its obligations under United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717 (1992), the Department requires the services of a consultant to perform a range of services, all central to addressing the above issue, including, but not limited to the following tasks:  1) developing recommendations regarding the findings; 2) consulting with OCR regarding these recommendations; and 3) preparing a written report to the Office for Civil Rights regarding options and strategies for addressing the outcome of the investigation.  It is estimated that it will require one consultant approximately 15 days to complete work on the case.  The start date is April 25, 2005.

As stated in the original notice, the Department intends to contract with Dr. Clifton Conrad.  The Department previously contracted with Dr. Conrad for assistance with the resolution of OCR Case No. 06032021.  The work under this proposed contract action is a continuation of the work under this same OCR case.  As a result of the work under this case, it was determined that the scope of the investigation related to the case needed to be expanded in order to complete the case.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another entity to be able to become familiar with the facts and history of OCR Case No. 06032021 and to offer similar services that would meet these requirements, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  All responsible sources, however, may submit a response to Rebecca Hucks at Rebecca.Hucks@ed.gov or Estelita Proctor at Estelita.Proctor@ed.gov which, if timely received, will be considered by the agency.

The use of Numbered Note 22, which refers to FAR Part 6, in the original notice was incorrect as FAR Part 6 does not apply to simplified acquisition procedures. However, in accordance with FAR 13.104(b), the Contracting Officer has determined that soliciting from a single source is appropriate based on the circumstances of the contract action.

<SUBJECT>R--CAPSTONE SEMINAR IN WATER RESOURCES PLANNING
<SOLNBR>W912HQ-05-T-0016
<RESPDATE>041505
<ARCHDATE>06142005
<CONTACT>claralyn sawyers, 703-428-7748
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a contract on a competitive basis for Capstone Seminar in Water Resources Planning Capstone Seminar in Water Resources Planning in an accelerated effort to strengthen the diminishing capability in the C orps of Engineers Planning community, the Headquarters Planning Division and IWR, at the Direction of the Director of Civil Works, joined with the Universities Council on Water Resources (UCOWR) to define a Masters program in water resources planning.  Th is was part of the overall effort entitled Planning Excellence Program, which was designed to help quickly fill the void left be an increasing number of senior and seasoned planners retiring.  The Masters program was designed to be multi-disciplinary and to include courses in: Water Resource Development: History and Principles; Economic Foundations for Public Decision Making; Mathematical Foundations for Public Decision Making; Environmental Law; Environmental Impact Assessment; and a Capstone Planning Pra cticum designed to provide case study and group work on a Corps of Engineers related planning project.  Once the curriculum standards were established, inquiries were made by UCOWR through their member universities to identify universities interested in de veloping and offering the COE Masters Program in Water Resources Planning and Management.  The initial universities were: the University of Florida, Johns Hopkins University, University of Arizona, Southern Illinois University, and Washington State Univer sity.  Harvard University has recently been added to the list of participating universities.  To date, some 16 Corps students have enrolled in the various programs.  One problem encountered by participating universities has been the Capstone Planning Pract icum, primarily because it is outside the typical course curriculum in that it relies heavily on a Corps of Engineers case study and practical application of theory to the case study. Purpose: The purpose of this Scope of Work is to solicit to develop the Capstone Planning Practicum course that would be used by all of the universities offering the COE Masters degree in Water Resources Planning and Management.  Each of the universities that have attempted to develop and present this course have been dissatisfied with the outcome.  Once developed, each of the participating universities will be invited to participate in the lecture portions of the Capstone course as well as the on-line por tions.  Tasks:  Task 1. Course Design Document  The overall course design must be drafted and negotiated among interested parties (USACE, and the UCOWR).  This will involve decisions on course objectives, the length of residence and online sessions, the lecture schedule f or the residence session, tentative identification of lecturers and other contributors, etc.  The result will be a course design document incorporating syllabus, course and module objectives, textbook and reference materials, schedule, and other materials as needed. Task 2. Lecture Outlines.  The course document will specify the number of formal lectures and the overall topic of each.  However, in order to ensure that the course incorporates all relevant material and that the lectures are reasonably coordinated, it wi ll be necessary to develop topical outlines for each session, together with lists of specific learning objectives.  These outlines will be prepared in draft form by the course development team, then elaborated and finalized with the assistance of the relev ant lecturer.  The learning objectives must be stated in a way that permits objective assessment of student achievement. Task 3. Case Study Development.  A suitable case study must be identified and prepared for use in the course.  The case study should illustrate a large, complex planning problem, which spans a number of disciplines and issues.  If possible, the case study should be drawn from recent experience of the Corps of other wate r resource planning agency, although it may be modified, redefined, and/or truncated so as to preclude the use of pre-existing analyses and to be manageable in the course time available.  Background materials, source documents, and data should be readily a vailable for students' use.  In addition, background lectures must be planned and developed.  These lectures will be presented during the residence session in order to prepare the students for the issues that will be addressed in the case study. Task 4. Online Session Development.  A plan will be developed for the online session, utilizing the capabilities of a known web server.  The plan will include decisions as to which communications media will be employed, how interactions among students will  be facilitated, what interim work products will be required, etc.  The plan will also specify the form of the final product, and the means for determining the contribution of the individual students.  It is anticipated that a panel of experienced water pl anners will review the final work product, will provide a critique, and will participate in the grading. Task 5. Course Delivery.  The course will be offered for the first time with continuing support from and monitoring by the Corps of Engineers.  It is estimated that five (5) outside lecturers will be utilized for one day each.  The remaining lectures will be presented by the host University staff, and/or Corps of Engineers staff, at no additional cost to the Corps.   Schedule to Complete: Task 1: Course Design Document  -  30 days from NTP Task 2: Lecture Outlines  -  60 days from NTP Task 3: Case Study Development  -  120 days from NTP Task 4: Online Session Development  - Concurrent with Task 3  - 120 days from NTP Task 5: Course Delivery  Target Date July/August 2005

The OCC is investigating vendor interest and capability in providing highly specialized interactive capital markets training that involves balance sheet management simulation and advanced trading simulation for their examiners as well as the ability to provision a training facility in support of the course delivery. This notice of sources sought is not a request for competitive proposals.  This notice does not commit the OCC to include respondents on a source list, to issue a solicitation, to award any contract, or to pay any cost incurred related to submission of information in response to this notice.  OCC may solicit some, all, or none of the respondents for the proposed requirement described herein. (2)Background: OCC examiners require highly specialized and unique capital markets training regarding balance sheet management, fixed income securities, derivative products, sophisticated trading techniques and traded products, hedging, financial markets and related portfolio and risk management principles.  OCC desires a method of instruction that will combine student reading, pre-course e-learning, professional lecture, hands on interactive exercises using advanced computer simulation techniques, and instructor assisted administration.  The training is designed to be intense and progress-oriented. The training is designed for capital markets examiner experts/specialists and certain fiduciary examiners who have strong knowledge in capital markets including fixed income products, portfolio management, balance sheet management trading activities, and risk management concepts. These examiners support the supervision of capital markets, trading, and investment portfolio activities in the largest and most sophisticated banks. This training will bring those examiners to the higher level of expertise needed for the OCC to fulfill its supervisory objectives. (3)General Description of the Requirements:
In a classroom setting, the vendor will provide a series of highly advanced capital markets courses geared for capital markets examiners.  The courses will be highly specialized combining instructor led as well as e-learning based course content.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued for informational and planning purposes only.
1.	INTRODUCTION
The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Contracting Flight is soliciting information on the supply chain practices and technologies available in the commercial sector.  This information will be used to conduct a comparison study for the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) in order to evaluate the supply chain management integration services and solutions available to support its role as the Department of Defense (DOD) Distribution Process Owner (DPO).  USTRANSCOM’s mandate as the DPO is to improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of distribution related activities--deployment, sustainment, and redeployment support.  To accomplish this mandate, USTRANSCOM is collaborating with Combatant Commands (COCOMs), the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the Services, Joint Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to develop Integrated Process Teams (IPTs) that are tasked to transform the processes within the DOD supply chain to provide the best possible support to the warfighter.
USTRANSCOM, in partnership with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), recently completed an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), which successfully demonstrated that commercial supply chain management technologies could be applied to the military distribution planning and execution environment.  The objective of AT21 is to provide improved customer service to the warfighter by applying best commercial supply chain practices and scheduling technologies that enable USTRANSCOM, its Transportation Component Commands (TCCs), and DLA to better respond to Joint Vision 2020 force projection and day-to-day distribution requirements through more effective and efficient global distribution management. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information on the practices and technologies available to meet DPO needs and understand commercial vendors’ experience levels with successful implementation of similar processes and tools across global distribution networks.

<SUBJECT>88 -- Yearling Steers for Research
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory, Mandan, North Dakota, intends to enter into a single source contract with Hettinger Research, Hettinger, North Dakota, a division of North Dakota State University, for the purchase of 46 head of yearling cattle for a research project consisting of spring and summer forage-finishing trials which will begin in May 2005.  The cattle must be from North or South Dakota so they represent the typical cattle that are raised in this region of the Great Plains.  The cattle must be very gentle because they will be kept in small pastures delineated by single wire electric fencing and they will be moved frequently by people on foot or 4-wheelers within 15 feet proximity.  The cattle must be accustomed to being fed from feed bunks.  The following cattle are required at this weight and  specific breeds in order for scientists to compare the weight gain on these particular breeds while grazing.  The cattle required are as follows:  Thirty-three (33) each Angus and/or Angus/Hereford crossbred yearling steers weighing between 850 and 900 pounds each.  Thirteen (13) each Angus/Simmental, or Angus/Gelbvieh, or Angus/Limousin crossbred yearling steers weighing between 850 and 900 pounds each.  The Angus or Angus/Hereford steers will be compared with the crossbred steers of Angus/Continental breeding in respect to their abilities to fatten while grazing high quality forage.  The industry standard for purchasing livestock is from a livestock auction or directly from individual ranchers, with payment required by check or cash on the date of sale.  The USDA-ARS is not able to purchase this amount of livestock in this manner.  Attendance at more than one auction or dealing with more than one rancher may be necessary to purchase the number and type of cattle required and price comparison with the current market reports will be required to determine price reasonableness prior to purchase.  Hettinger Research Center has the capability of determining what animals are suitable for different types of research, purchasing animals, as well as doing research.  *Provide Qualification Statement by Close of Business April 19, 2005, if interested in this procurement.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Broadvision Upgrade
<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule task order to Broadvision, Incorporated.  The GSA Federal Supply Service (FSS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO)plans to negotiate with Broadvision Incorporated for license upgrades, due to the addition of 4 new CPUs in the current hardware operating platform.  As a result of the new CPUs, additional licenses are required.  During FY 05, OCIO migrated and upgraded the server hardware environment.   During this migration, gaps occurred between the quantity of license permits and the quantity of servers in which the Broadvision applications reside.  For example, gaps were uncovered when additional server capacity (new servers, memory, and CPUs) was added to address operational concerns; while assessing newly applicable charges, it became apparent that (a) the profile of Broadvision license models had changed, (b) staff changes at Broadvision resulted in loss of institutional knowledge of GSA’s licensing agreements and (c) sizing parameters established at licensing time were no longer in agreement with the operational systems. To rectify the situation, FSS and Broadvision initiated a collaborative audit to scope the issue and resolve licensing discrepancies.  As a result, FSS requires license support for 4 new CPUs identified by GSA as additional to the original 22 CPU count covered in the original maintenance agreement.  This procurement is conducted under the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 USC 501).  The Federal Acquisition Regulation basis is cited in FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1), “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by- (a)(2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B). In February 2000 a competitive procurement was awarded for the Customization and Personalization of the GSA Advantage system.  Broadvision was the one of the competitive solutions considered and recommended by the technical evaluation team.   It was also considered the reasonable and acceptable solution based on price.  Therefore, on the basis of the best value determination, CIO established Broadvision as the standard eGovernment portal management software for the GSA Advantage system.  As a result, Broadvision has been implemented as the primary environment to develop and run other mission critical business applications.  To introduce a new portal management tool is impractible.  The Broadvision product provides an end-to-end, seamless and uniformed management of ebusiness tools.  For example, use of additional ebusiness management tools would require multiple password assignments and a dictionary to show which tools are managed by Broadvision vs another portal management tool.  Implementation of new or additional ebusiness software would impair agility of the current environment in that multiple environments would have to be accessed to upgrade or update software applications.  Because the office of the Chief Information Officer has already determined that Broadvision meets current operating needs, there is no requirement to incur additional costs to convert to a new environment.  The Broadvision tool supports ebusiness over GSA Advantage, an environment.  To convert to a new software environment (which provides less than the end-to-end capability provided by Broadvision) would potentially disrupt continuity of mission critical service.  This sole source procurement is under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 202-215-9703, email:holly.carr@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>A--SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITY FOR BANDWIDTH SUPPORT TO RETURN TO FLIGHT MISSIONS (STS-114, STS-121)
<DESC>INTRODUCTION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Vision is: To improve life here, To extend life to there, To find life beyond. As Discovery and Atlantis are readied for their respective Return to Flight Missions, NASA is preparing to meet public demand to see the launches and missions.  NASA’s primary method for disseminating content is via the NASA Web Portal (www.nasa.gov).  Based on data from previous missions (Mars Exploration Rover Mission, Huygens Landing, etc…) we expect 20 to 30 million visits to the NASA Web Portal with 250,000 to 500,000 Internet users also accessing NASA TV coverage via Web Streaming.   In the existing portal infrastructure, if this demand increase materializes, NASA may:	 1.  Cap the number of visitors and hours of web streaming coverage.  This would force visitors to find content from other venues that may or may not cover the Return to Flight Missions. 2.  Increase NASA’s bandwidth coverage under NASA’s existing contract to support the NASA Portal to meet the increased demand. NASA is releasing this announcement to solicit proposals from Non-NASA entities to support option 2 by sponsoring the bandwidth costs associated with increasing public access for the Return to Flight Missions.   In exchange for this sponsorship NASA will consider offers to display the logo of the sponsor(s) and give credit to the sponsor(s) on the NASA Web Portal for the contribution of bandwidth costs.  NASA will consider other suitable innovative concepts to acknowledge and publicize the Offeror’s sponsorship.  NASA intends to enter into a Space Act Agreement with the selected sponsor and the existing NASA Web Portal contractor to cover these actions.	The selected sponsor(s) will in turn enter into an agreement with the existing NASA Web Portal contractor to pay for the associated costs of the bandwidth or a portion thereof. This Announcement is open through April 13, 2005.   NASA will not issue paper copies of this announcement.	NASA reserves the right to select for Space Act Agreement all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NASA provides no funding for reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Material submitted in response to this Announcement will not be returned.  It is the policy of NASA to safeguard all proposals as confidential and privileged information and NASA will not, without permission of the Offeror, use or disclose their contents for other than evaluation purposes.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE MAGNETO-RADAR/FIELD DISTURBANCE SENSOR AND METHODS, FOR METAL DETECTORS AND NON-METAL DETECTORS, DERIVED FROM MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR)
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE MAGNETO-RADAR/FIELD DISTURBANCE SENSOR AND METHODS, FOR METAL DETECTORS AND NON-METAL DETECTORS, DERIVED FROM MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR) TECHNOLOGIES 

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more licensees to commercialize LLNL's current patents and a newly allowed, soon to be published patent covering the Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal detectors and non-metal detectors, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods technology.

ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION ON MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR) TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS CAN BE OBTAINED AT: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/sensor/MicropowerImpulseRadar/index.php

* The Magneto-Radar is a completely new approach to a motion and range detection sensor for conductive materials whether metal or non metal.  

* Materials may possibly be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve by detection at remote distances of very small vibrations such as from a turning fork induced in the targets. Ground balance problems are either eliminated or substantially reduced in most cases. 

* Low-cost potential applications exist in treasure hunting equipment, medical, industrial, mining, security and safety screening, and analytical equipment.  

* LLNL's licensed field disturbance technology with range gating has been the basis for other products and other applications such as range controlled radar motion sensor for security application products selling commercially for under seventy dollars ($70) in the quantity of one.

* MIR and field disturbance sensors provide range to object information while screening out clutter and discriminating from other signals due to the environment, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.

* The MIR or field disturbance sensors can detect the source of small vibrations of target at signal levels such as from a tuning fork, or steel guitar strings at greater distances isolated from all unwanted signal returns which are zeroed out. 

* Varying frequencies and inter-modulation products of induced magnetic field targets or resonance including NQR in other targets, may possibly provide more information to distinguish and identify them from other materials or movements.     

These technologies and methods relate to employing a portable, low-power, battery operated radar to sense and locate (range to object) even microscopic mechanically excited motion or vibration in objects such as but not limited to conductive and nonconductive bio-materials, including ferrous and non ferrous metals, wherein the mechanical vibration and resonance may be the result of mechanical, acoustic, magnetic, optical or electromagnetic excitation.  In many cases, the aforementioned materials can be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve. Ground balance problems are either substantially reduced by utilizing either the range gating and sensitive motion features of these technologies in combination or separately.

The MIR and field disturbance sensors are range-gated radars, which provide range to object information while screening out clutter, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.  The MIR and field disturbance sensor can be used in three capacities: (1) non-magneto, (2) magneto, or (3) contrast.  When used in the non-magneto capacity, the MIR and field disturbance sensor provides a substantially improved means of detecting stationary mechanically and/or acoustically (ex. for use in detection between walls in a building) induced vibrating and resonating objects and materials.  In the magneto capacity, the magnetically or electromagnetically induced vibration and resonance of an object can be detected via a characteristic double harmonic frequency.  Third, the radar can also detect the target object through microscopic movement resulting from changes in the size, image or contrast of the object.  

The Magneto-Radar using either LLNL's MIR or the field disturbance sensor is a completely new approach to motion and range detection sensor technology using a bipolar generator, which generates unique double harmonics detectable by MIR or the field disturbance sensor.  The MIR and field disturbance sensors are a new low-cost implementation of a pulse echo radar.  Conventional radar pulses travel at the speed of light and require an oscilloscope for high speed sweeps in even nanoseconds, but LLNL's MIR and field disturbance sensor uses a time expansion technology known as equivalent time allowing it to sweep a million times slower or on a millisecond scale. This range-gated radar operates as a pulse echo system that clocks the two way time of flight of a very short electrical pulse.  It involves using a bipolar magnetic field to induce an eddy current in the target object generating a corresponding magnetic field and resulting vibration (the onset of this motion provides the same detectable phase shift 
information relied upon by traditional metal detectors for determining various materials based on conductivity), transmitting various radar frequency signals to the conductive object, receiving reflected radar signals resulting from motion in the object, and processing the receive radar signals to produce an output signal that corresponds to a harmonic and/or an inter-modulation product of the resonating target object in the magnetic field.  The MIR radar transmits short, ultra-wideband electromagnetic pulses and the receiver is designed to only receive signals from a preset range(s) R.  If there are no changes within or at range R, then the integrated return signal remains constant because stationary clutter signals are integrated as part of the constant return.  However, if anything penetrates the shell, it will change the reflectivity in range R, which causes a change in the detectable return signal attributed to motion.  Through doing this as well, the varying frequencies of the induced magnetic field targets can be more readily distinguished and identified from other materials or movements through harmonic analysis.  For example, when the magnetic excitation varies sinusoidally at a frequency F, the resulting resonance of the conductive object may occur at, but is not limited to 2F, providing a unique harmonic signature that is detected by the motion sensing MIR radar (ex. a bipolar excitation frequency of 60 Hz would result in a harmonic frequency of 120 Hz).     

Since the magnetic field of a traditional metal detector must travel out to the object and then couple back to the generator, a sixth order decrease in signal strength versus range results, forming a formidable limitation in range.  In fact, it is estimated that traditional metal detectors can only detect coins and jewelry at depths of only approximately 8 inches.  In the case of the Magneto-Radar, however, induction of the target and magnetic field emanating from the target object can be obtained via use of the coil of a traditional metal detector or via a more powerful custom magnetic field generator.  The strength of the induced magnetic field is usually directly proportional to the detection range.  Significantly increased magnetic field strength can be obtained by generating short duration, high peak power, pulsed magnetic fields, even with traditional metal detector coils, without overheating the coil because of the extremely short duty cycle of the MIR or the field disturbance sensor needed to recognize movement of the target. LLNL's patented Ultra-Short Pulse Generator and High Voltage Mofset Switching Circuit may provide an inexpensive and small package means for this purpose (example: 100KW output from a 1W DC input). 

LLNL is seeking licensees with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace.  All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal detectors and non-metal detectors, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).


Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River MD 4.5 Department has a COMPETITIVE requirement to acquire MF/HF transmitter systems for Modular Commando Solo (MCS) Program.  The planned MCS system shall include a Roll-On/Roll-Off (RORO) MF, HF, FM, and Narrowband broadcasting system that is mounted on pallets that are loaded on a C-130J Aircraft.

<DESC>This amendment makes changes and additions to the solicitation (see below), provides responses to contractor’s questions and changes the closing date.  

No changes to (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (viii), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiv), (xv) or (xvii).  No change to  (xvii) but it is reprinted for clarity.    
 
(v) A list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure, (including option(s), if applicable).   CLIN 0001 – Develop the first comic book, 1 ea;  CLIN 0002 – Follow on Comic Books, 11 ea – One per month;  CLIN 0003 Option CLIN 12 ea. - One per month.     

(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired.  
1.  GENERAL. The Contractor shall provide development of an original comic book series to include creation of character lines with supporting artwork, technical editorial support, storyboard development, and all required artwork.    

1.1. BACKGROUND.  In order to achieve long-term peace and stability in the Middle East, the youth need to be reached.  One effective means of influencing youth is through the use of comic books.  A series of comic books provides the opportunity for youth to learn lessons, develop role models and improve their education.  

2.  Qualifications, Experience and Requirements.  

2.1.  Contractor must demonstrate qualifications and experience in design and production of four-color comic books.  

2.2.  Knowledge of Arab language and cultures, law enforcement and small unit military operations is desired.  

2.3.  The comic books will be produced in Arabic so the boxes will have to follow a sequence of right to left and top to bottom.  Although knowledge of Arabic is not required, the contractor must have the capability to incorporate Arabic text into the final product and also provide a copy with blank bubbles and void of all printed text “sound effects.”

2.4.  The series will be based on the security forces, military and police, in the near future in the Middle East in cooperation with the Ministries of Interior of some of those countries.  The comic series will be subject to change based on initial focus group testing of a prototype comic.  If the subject matter for a specific comic does not do well in its intended focus group then it may be dropped and/or a new basis for the comic will be selected.  There may be opportunities for this series to continue and additional comic series to be developed next year based on feedback from the first series.     

2.5.  The US Army retains all rights to the intellectual property contained in these comic books.  Further, the Contractor shall not use or disclose any information concerning this product in any form whatsoever, to include advertising.   

3.  OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1.  The comic book will be produced based on thematic guidance from representatives of the U.S. Army, who will also provide the Arabic translation.  The contractor will provide an initial submission of each comic book for cultural review and approval.  The first two comic book submissions will be pre-tested.  Modifications resulting from pre-testing will be made by the contractor and resent to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) with actual production being done by the U.S. Army.  

3.2.  The final proof shall be submitted via electronic means in both JPEG and COREL format to the COR for evaluation.  The COR will approve comic book materials that meet the criteria specified in this Statement of Work within 72 hours.  The basis for rejection shall be articulated by the COR and shall conform to one or more of the requirements of the Statement of Work. 

3.3.  If the COR determines that the comic book material is not being produced in accordance to the standards of this Statement of Work, the problem will be identified, discussed and resolved with the Contractor’s management.  The representative will not try to rectify the problem directly with the comic book creators.     

4.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIAL/SUPPORT      

4.1.  No material support will be provided by the U.S. Army to the contractor.  

4.2.  Costs for the printing and distribution of the comic will be Government’s responsibility and are not covered by this contract action.  

4.3.  The COR will provide thematic guidance, and cultural expertise to the contractor.  Additionally, photos of regional architecture, vehicles, and people, which will serve as a basis for the artwork will be provided.    

5.  SECURITY CLEARANCE.  The Contractor will not be required to handle classified material.  

6.  SCHEDULE:  Delivery of one comic book per month is required, based on a proof of concept.  This contract will be for the completion of 12 comics, 16 page sides (including covers), size A4, comic books and an option for 12 additional comic books.       

7.  CONTRACTOR FURNISHED MATERIAL/SUPPORT

7.1.  Sufficient management personnel to oversee this effort, and ensure that work performed is in accordance with the Statement of Work.  

7.2.	Any necessary pre-service and in-service training.  

(vii) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance are provided above, and the FOB point is DEST via electronic means.  

(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Evaluation Information:  The Government will award the contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government on the basis of (1) Technical  (2) Past Performance and (3) PRICE, as explained below.  
1.  Technical.  The Government will assess the technical capability of each offeror on the following areas.   The Government will NOT assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value.
a.  Approach to performance/completion of the Comic Books, to include time lines and discussions on the individuals or group that will be working on the effort.     

b.  2 Samples of previous work.

c.  Special Benefits.  Discuss the company’s special benefits/resources that add value to their proposal.    

2.  Past Performance.  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Government will contact some of each offeror's customers to ask whether or not they believe:  (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  Federal, state and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases.  The Government will not evaluate an offeror's organizational past performance on the basis of the personal past performance of the offeror's key personnel.  The Government may evaluate the organizational past performance of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors.

3.  Price.  The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the price of each acceptable offer in relation to the offeror's relative capability.  Price will be evaluated on the basis of price analysis if adequate competition is obtained.

4.    Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors.  Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government considers an offeror's Technical capability to be more important than Past Performance or  Price.  The elements of Technical are in descending order of importance.  However, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection will depend on the differences among the competing offerors.  See Source Selection Decision, below.

5.   Source Selection Decision.  In order to select the winning offeror, the Government will rank the offerors from best to worst.  If one offeror has both the better capability and the lower price, then that offeror will be the better value.  If one offeror has the better capability and the higher price, then the source selection authority will decide whether the difference in capability is worth the difference in price.  If the source selection authority considers the better capability to be worth the higher price, then the more capable, higher-priced offeror will be the better value.  If not, then the less capable, lower-priced offeror will be the better value.  The Source Selection Authority will continue to make paired comparisons until he or she has decided which offeror represents the best value.

The following clauses are added via amendment to (xiii).  52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract, (Mar 2000)  (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of expiration, provided, that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.  (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.  (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 2 years.  (End of Clause)
and 52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds.  

(xvi) Signed and dated quotes referencing the RFQ number H92239-05-T-0026 and includes sufficient technical information as outlined in the Evaluation Section above, Past performance information, and pricing, must be submitted, no later than 5:00 p.m. 12 April 2005, to Karen Glass at FAX (910) 432-9345 or email to glasska@soc.mil.  An acknowledgement will be sent from the Contracting Officer upon receipt, the contractor is responsible for ensuring their email/fax has been received.
