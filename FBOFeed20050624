The purpose of this procurement is to make arrangements for a one-day meeting for the Division of Transplantation’s showcase of HRSA’s social and behavioral research grants to occur in conjunction with a 2-day national summit on donation and transplantation Sponsored by the Coalition on Donation.
In order not to create yet another meeting and to make attendance cost-effective for organ procurement and transplant organizations, DoT wishes to hold a 1-day grant showcase adjacent to the existing meeting of donation education professionals.

DoT plans to hold its grant showcase on the day following this summit, November 4.  Grantees will make presentations on their interventions, methodology, and results and provide suggestions for how their projects can be adapted by others. This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance for this project is 6 months.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file. 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.601-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>A) Overview

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) requires contract personnel to support the Engineering Department by performing a variety of Engineering  related functions including, but not limited to, technology development, application, planning, analysis, design and acquisition management and integrated life cycle support  planning, maintenance and environmental management, and software management in support of USPS operational and financial goals. The services required deal primarily with experienced technical and management specialists who are capable of performing in a professional environment in support of the systems and technology transforming the USPS into a world class 21st Century business.

Currently Engineering uses over 150 contract persons in numerous labor categories, funded by various different financial accounts, and it is anticipated that these figures will remain viable for the duration of the initial contract term.  However, the USPS may increase or decrease the number of contract personnel at any time, and there is no guaranteed minimum number of contract employees that must be maintained.

Most contract employees are domiciled at the Engineering offices in Merrifield, VA or some specific supplier’s facility.  Depending upon assignment, some contract employees may travel extensively throughout the United States.  Some assignments may require less or more than 40 hours per week.  A five-day workweek is contemplated for most assignments.  No minimum workweek is guaranteed.  

The supplier must be able to perform recruiting, managing, invoicing, and reporting tasks as a minimum.  Training shall be provided as necessary by the supplier in order to meet and maintain personnel requirements.  

B)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available technical staffing and management services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process, Reverse Auction or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities. The USPS may make one or more awards to support this activity.

C)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available technical and management services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

D)  Notification to Selected Suppliers

The contracting officer will notify all respondents of their pre-qualification status.  The list of pre-qualified candidates will be publicized.

E)  Request for Information Instructions

1.	At least two years in the temporary technical staffing services business.
2.	Key personnel including recruiters to have quality professional qualifications.

Cost Reduction Plans: Note: This is a proposed Cost Reduction Plan to be tailored and included in future procurement evaluation factor.  The Government is requesting from prospective offerors to provide input or comments for inclusion to the solicitation. FACTOR 1B, COST REDUCTION PLANS (CRPs).   a. The contractor shall identify from the requirements contained in Section C no fewer than one process for a cost reduction plan (CRP) to be carried out in the base period of this task order using Lean Methodology, Six Sigma techniques, Business Process Reengineering (BPR), or other industry-recognized process improvement technique(s).  Proposals that fail to provide at least one CRI that meets criteria stated herein will no longer be considered for award.  b. In a maximum of two pages per identified process, the contractor shall identify (1) The process to be improved during the base year; (2) The person(s) or consultant(s) who will lead the process improvement effort along with his/her/their qualifications (training and nature of any previous similar efforts); (3) The type of process improvement technique(s) to be applied; (4) A timeline for implementing the improved process; (5) A timeline showing anticipated point at which cost savings can be realized to the Government; (6) The metrics that will be used to manage the process and show cost savings; (7) A rough order of magnitude, expressed in hours, dollars, or percent of effort, of anticipated savings; and (8) A rough order of magnitude, expressed in hours, dollars, or percent of effort, of the planned investment.  Investment cannot exceed 33% of the planned savings. c. Processes identified for CRP and approach to process improvement shall be evaluated on  (1) Scope of effort, identifying process by paragraph(s) of Section C; (2) Realism of potential cost savings and a minimum 200% return on investment (ROI); (3) Realism of approach to process improvement; and  (4) Total overall savings to the Government; (5) Use of existing technology; (6) Traceability/auditability of process improvement; and (7) Implementation costs and associated costs. d. No later than 45 calendar days after receipt of order, the contractor will meet with the Task Order Manager (TOM) and technical points of contact selected by the TOM to review the planned CRPs.  At that meeting, the contractor shall present a written plan for achieving savings under the CRP.  That plan will include (1) A process chart showing the steps of the current, existing or legacy (“as-is”) process identified in the proposal; (2) A list of personnel (both contractor and Government, if a joint team is working the process) who are participating in the CRP;  (3) A schedule of planned CRP events; and (4) The metrics that will be used to manage the process and show cost savings e. Subsequently, the contractor will meet with the TOM and his/her selected technical POCs by the 15th day of each month to review progress toward the planned cost savings goals.     f. Within 5 business days of implementation of the improved process, the contractor shall meet with the TOM and technical POCs and detail  (1) The revised, reengineered or improved (i.e., “to-be”) process;  (2) The schedule of deliverables, products or services generated by the process; (3) The planned accrual of cost savings; and   (4) The metrics that will be used to manage the process and demonstrate cost savings g. Within 30 business days of the conclusion of the base period and any exercised option periods of this task order, or within thirty business days of the conclusion of any discrete reengineered process task within this task order, the contractor shall present, in writing, to the TOM a statement with supporting billing information showing any contractor cost reductions realized as the result of CRPs carried out under plans identified in the proposal.  Such cost reductions must be accompanied by  (1) A description of the modified or reengineered process, showing all significant process steps to the level of detail necessary for a qualified worker to understand what actions the steps require; (2) An explanation of how the process improvement lowered contractor costs; and (3) A breakdown of savings to be returned to the Government via de-obligation of funds.   h. Upon validation of the base year(s) cost savings by the Government, 30% of the amount de-obligated to the Government shall be returned to the contractor.   i. If any option period is exercised, the contractor shall, within 30 calendar days of the start of each option period, identify to the TOM one additional process from Section C to undergo CRP using Lean Methodology, Six Sigma techniques, Business Process Reengineering (BPR), or other industry-recognized process improvement technique(s).  These processes may be either (1) processes that have not previously been improved under the provisions of this task order, or (2) processes previously improved that the contractor identifies for further improvement.  The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (g) above apply to all option periods exercised.   j.  Upon validation of the cost savings by the Government, 35% of the amount de-obligated to the Government during the first option year, if exercised, shall be returned to the contractor, and 40% of the amount de-obligated to the Government during the second and subsequent option years, if exercised, shall be returned to the contractor. k. Savings returned to the contractor will occur only for the Period of Performance or Option Period in which the process improvement occurs.   Validated cost reductions on any process will, upon the exercise on any subsequent option year, become the new base price for that process for that year and no CRP incentive monies shall be paid in that year and subsequent years, if options are exercised.  All validated cost savings realized via CRP for any process during the task order base year shall be counted for incentive payment during that same base year only.  No process CRP savings monies shall be returned to the contractor in task order option years beyond the base or option year in which the CRP for that process occurred, unless a subsequent option year CRP on that process garnered further validated savings.  All process improvements are identified and included in option years by contract modification.   l.  All process improvements must be sustained throughout the life of the task order, including all option years that may be exercised.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice is a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-04. This requirement is being conducted on a full and open competition basis.  NAICS code 423490. The National Weather Service (NWS) provides weather, water, climate forecasts, and warnings for the protection of life, property and the enhancement of the national economy.  The Ceilometer provides a capability that is a critical component of this mission in that the information on cloud height from the sensor will be used to improve severe winter weather warnings of snow and ice condition, flood forecasts and warnings, support to aviation, and severe thunderstorm forecasts and warnings.  The Ceilometer will be integrated into the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) as part of the sensor suite.  Ceilometer data will be processed and included in the transmitted ASOS weather observation report and messages. The sensor shall be capable of meeting the requirement of measuring cloud heights to 25,000 feet for most sites in support of aviation, and to 40,000 feet at approximately 240 sites in support of aviation and climate requirements. This acquisition is the first of four phases: Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Evaluation, Development & System Integration, Limited Production, and Full Scale Production.  The Government intends to award firm fixed-price contracts to several vendors for the COTS Evaluation phase.  Evaluation will cover both 25,000 foot and 40,000 foot ceilometers.  From this initial COTS purchase, the Government intends to down select to a single vendor (or possibly two if the aforementioned mix is judged to be more advantageous to the Government).  Award of follow on phases will be contingent upon successful completion of this initial COTS evaluation phase.  The projected ceiling of all phases is 34 million. Contractors are to submit a firm fixed price for either or both  25K and 40K ceilometers.  The proposed unit price is for 2 to 5 COTS ceilometers.  Proposal package to include, 2 operators manuals that are normally provided with COTS unit, 2 mounting/ installation instructions (if not included in the operators manual), 5 technical proposals, 3 cost proposals.  Date of delivery 60 days after award. This is a best value procurement with technical and price being equal. The competitive range will consist of companies that have a reasonable chance of being awarded a follow on phase contract. The COTS sensors will undergo a meteorological performance demonstration for approximately six months to one year.  The test sites may include: Sterling, VA Research and Development Center, Johnstown, PA (remote) test site. The meteorological performance demonstration will be an evaluation factor in the follow-on Development/Pre-Production solicitation/ contract. Empirical Test Data: The Offeror shall provide empirical test data to demonstrate the capabilities of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensor that they propose to submit.  This must include comparison data that shows sensor performance in the field in a variety of weather conditions.  The test data shall be in the form of test reports of field comparisons to references or reference sensors; and/or case studies of field performance in snow, icing, and other precipitation conditions.  Offerors may submit empirical test data for a similar sensor if such data does not exist for the specific sensor model being proposed.  Failure to provide empirical test data will not automatically exclude an offeror from consideration but will make inclusion in the competitive range unlikely. Each offeror shall identify the requirements in the Specification for a Ceilometer Sensor for the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) Specification Number NWS-S100-CHI-SP1000 that are not currently fully met by the offered COTS sensor and will provide a brief (2-3 sentence) description of how the offeror proposes meeting the requirement during the follow-on Development Phase. These sensors will be evaluated for compliance with those specification requirements that the offeror’s proposal states are met by the COTS unit. . Empirical test data, supporting that the COTS sensor has been demonstrated to be substantially compliant, must be provided and will be analyzed as supporting evidence. The competitive range will consist of offeror’s whose COTS sensors, after modification can be reasonably expected to fully meet all requirements of the Specification and delivered at a cost that is competitive. Place(s) of delivery and acceptance of all COTS ceilometer sensors: U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/National Weather Service Sterling Test Facility, 43741 Weather Service Road, Sterling, VA 20166 Attention: Michael Salyards 703-661-1241. FOB Destination.  Provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items, with its offer. Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Proposals due July 11, 2005 2pm Eastern Daylight Savings Time at 1325 East West Highway, Room 15300 Attn: LaMar Carlson, Silver Spring, MD 20910.

<DESC>There is NO INCUMBENT Recipient or contractor.  At the level of the PRIME Recipient, THIS PROJECT IS RESTRICTED TO STATE GOVERNMENTS, STATE DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION, CITY GOVERNMENTS, CITY DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION, OTHER CITY AGENCIES, COUNTY GOVERNMENTS, COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION, COUNTY AGENCIES, AND METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS.   The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) hopes to issue two or more Cooperative Agreements enabling the FHWA to partner with State, local, and/or Regional PUBLIC entities of the type just mentioned, in order to use their services and creativity to assess, demonstrate and further develop----from the realm of theory to that of real-world practice----the idea of a Regional Concept for Transportation Operations.   Each Recipient shall:  enhance or expand the efforts of existing regional transportation operations collaboration and coordination in one or more operational activities to be identified by the applicant; enhance and sustain processes for regional transportation operations collaboration and coordination that describe how the region works to achieve its objectives; based on the work just described, develop and implement a Regional Concept for Transportation Operations in one or more operational activities within each region; cooperate with the FHWA and an independent evaluator (to be funded SEPARATELY from, and OUTSIDE, these Cooperative Agreements) by sharing operational collaboration and coordination experiences and expectations prior to the demonstration project, during the demonstration project, and beyond the demonstration project;  coordinate key activity with the independent evaluator and accommodate that independent evaluator’s presence at these activities; submit monthly status reports electronically; submit Quarterly Progress Reports; and submit a Final Report.  The FHWA plans to select REGIONALLY-oriented entities representing at least two DIFFERENT metropolitan areas.   Two or more public entities of the type mentioned above would----IF they CHOSE----be allowed to TEAM UP as a partnership within a SINGLE proposal (Application) for a single Cooperative Agreement----PROVIDED that the Application explicitly DESIGNATES one and ONLY one of those partnering entities as the one and ONLY one PRIME Recipient of the Cooperative Agreement.  A maximum of $200,000 in Federal funds per metropolitan area (i.e., per Cooperative Agreement) will be provided over a two-year period, and that funding will INCLUDE amounts of up to $100,000 to be provided to each Cooperative Agreement in EACH YEAR.   At the level of the SUBrecipient (i.e., subcontractor), the Federal funding may NOT be used to pay for services rendered by any organization of a type DIFFERENT from the permissible PRIME types listed above; the only EXCEPTION to that restriction regarding subs is that ANY type of sub may provide PERIPHERAL support such as:  (a) helping to organize or facilitate meetings or workshops; and (b) providing DOCUMENTATION and PACKAGING for the Regional Concept for Transportation Operations.  There will be no Pre-Proposal Conference.  The DUE DATE shown above for submission of Applications is only an ESTIMATED date; the ACTUAL due date will be published in the Request for Applications (RFA), and the RFA will be published hereafter in THIS website (http://www.eps.gov).

<RESPDATE>071505
<ARCHDATE>08152005
<CONTACT>Bob Bochenek,(937) 904-6643
<DESC>F-15 E Radar Modernization Program The F-15 Systems Group Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be a radar provider for the F-15E aircraft. The nature of such an effort will require access to SECRET/NOFORN and higher classified material.   Firms responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in any future solicitations or contract awards.   Below is a description of the F-15E Radar Modernization Program (RMP) and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to identify your company's expertise, capabilities, and experience. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of two separate contracts.  The first contract is for execution of the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the F15E RMP.  Major SDD tasks will include design, development, full weapon system integration and test of a radar system that meets the requirements documented in the Capability Development Document (CDD), into the F-15E Weapon System. The Capability Development Document (CDD) for the F-15E Radar Modernization Program has been approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council.  The CDD may be reviewed by contacting Ms Sherlyn Robinson (937) 255-3816 (Sherlyn.Robinson@wpafb.af.mil) and providing the required security information. After successful completion of both SDD and Milestone C, a production contract will be awarded for both Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and procurement of the first lots of production hardware.  As part of any production contract(s), the government will also purchase training support for Organizational-Level (O- level) maintenance personnel, training equipment upgrades, test equipment for an Interim Contractor Support (ICS) capability, and three years of ICS support.  If the decision is made to provide long term support via an organic depot, the government may also decide to procure depot support equipment at this time.  The Milestone C decision will also address timing of "break out"  procurement of subsequent radar production lots.   Projected contract award dates are no later than FY09 for SDD and FY10/11 for LRIP.  Background There are presently 224 USAF F-15E aircraft in service worldwide.  The current radars are, on average, 22 years old and are experiencing problems in reliability, diminishing manufacturing sources, and increasing radar sustainment costs.   The goal of the F-15E Radar Modernization Program (RMP) is to affordably upgrade the F-15E radar system to significantly improve Reliability, Maintainability + Supportability (RM+S), maintain APG-70 operational capability, and lay the groundwork for future network-centric warfare requirements.  Our plan is to leverage existing COTS/GOTS radar systems technology from already developed systems (examples include F/A-18E/F (APG-79), F/A-22 (APG-77) and F-35 (APG-81)). By emphasizing reuse and integration of existing technologies, the F-15E RMP approach will keep the program development risks low and development costs at a fraction of similar fighter radar improvement programs.  The F-15E RMP will combine developmental and operational test activities to reduce schedule and cost.  Using existing technologies will increase parts commonality across aircraft platforms, significantly improving supply chain management and reducing spares inventory and depot repair level costs.  The modernized radar's open architecture and standard interfaces will facilitate technology insertion, technology refresh and component improvement. This upgraded radar will be an important component of Combat Identification (CID) and Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD) Families of System. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY: Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUB Zone small business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) has a requirement to increase the  quantity of GBU-28C/B (BLU-122) Air Foil Group (AFG) load trainers, provided under contract FA8681-05-C-0075, from 8 each to 13 each.  The contractor is required to fabricate, assemble, test, and deliver AFG trainers that replicate the physical  characteristics of the live operational production assets.  The current quantity of 8 trainers was previously established within the basic contract for Lot 1 production of the GBU-28C/B, awarded on 10 Feb 2005.  In order to perform this effort, a contractor must have detailed, intimate knowledge of the BLU-122 and associated production processes.  This is necessary because a level III reprocurement drawing package was not procured.  Raytheon Missile Systems is the only known manufacturer capable of meeting all the Government's requirements at an affordable cost and within the program's schedule.  All AFG trainers shall  be delivered by 31 May 2006.  This synopsis is published as notification of the Government’s intent to procure the additional load trainers from Raytheon Missile Systems as a sole-source modification to contract FA8681-05-C-0075.  The Government will accept and evaluate information on other potential sources capable of delivering all the requirements for the trainers within the prescribed time and at a reasonable price.  This synopsis is not an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to an award of contract; however, any proposals submitted as a result of this notification, and prior to any subsequent contract award, will be considered by the Contracting Officer.  This acquisition will utilize the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511, with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  For contractual information concerning this synopsis, please contact the Contracting Officer, Mr. Steve Wall, at (850) 882-3525, extension 3111.  For technical information, contact the Program Manager, Maj Steve Pearce, at (850) 882-3525, ext 2131.  Numbered Note #22 applies.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
	
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(c)	The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation.  The Estimated Quantity represents the Government’s best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract.  The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract.  The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.

    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity, does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the Small Business Administrations (SBA) Regions 4, 5, 6 (except New Mexico), 7 and 8 (except Montana & Utah) and those 8(a) firms with bona-fide places of business in these SBA districts (See http://www.sba.gov/regions/map/ to view Region Map).  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to be selected from 8(a) firms, within specified SBA districts, that meet the qualification requirements as set forth in this announcement.  Those firms that can demonstrate that they meet the qualification requirements will be awarded a BOA.  The estimated period of performance for the BOAs will be one year (1) with the Navy reserving the right to exercise options for up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c).  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the specified SBA District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (Navy) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The Navy will compete task orders issued under the BOAs among the BOA holders.  Each task order that is issued shall constitute a separate contract. Each task order may contain pre-priced options for the continued performance of environmental work under the task order.  The BOA firm will be required to furnish all labor, materials, tools, management, supervision, laboratory testing, engineering and equipment required of the task order.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained from the BOA firms within the designated SBA District, the Navy reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent Districts.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 for each task order that can be awarded to an 8(a) firm. There is no assurance of a steady stream of work under this program.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future orders with the Contractor or to require the Navy to solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.

These projects must include a narrative that demonstrated your ability to successfully meet client needs, timely delivery of services at reasonable prices, and any interfacing with regulators or concerned community groups.  Offeror will be given either an Acceptable or an Unacceptable rating for this factor depending upon the performance evaluations that were received for this factor.  If an offeror received any past performance references that are less than acceptable, the offeror will not be given a BOA.  If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it will receive a neutral rating. 
	Technical Factor 2: Project Experience. This factor considers the relevancy, breadth and depth of experience of the firm in providing the same or similar RAO/LTM services as described in the Scope of Work. The individual experience of offerors current or prospective personnel will not be considered in this factor. Firms must provide information to demonstrate prior experience on contracts that are similar in scope, complexity, and size to the requirements; and to demonstrate experience in performing environmental RAO/LTM services as stated in the above Scope of Work. Offerors shall submit this information in the following format:

Indicate if your firm was the Prime contractor or acted as a subcontractor under each project.  If your firm performed the work as a subcontractor, indicate the percentage of effort and type of work involved as the subcontractor. Firms may use the same submission as set forth in Technical Factor 1.  Firms will receive either an Acceptable or an Unacceptable for this factor. An Acceptable rating will be based upon whether the contracts proposed are similar in scope, complexity, and size as the projected type of RAO/LTM work set forth in the Scope of Work. Any firm with no corporate experience of similar size, scope and complexity will be given an Unacceptable rating.
Technical Factor 3: Management Internal Communication (Project Management). This factor considers the type, effectiveness and efficiency of the offerors internal communication system that is used to actively manage projects. The system should not be limited to use in RAO/LTM projects, but rather should be descriptive of all the projects that the offeror is actively engaged in.   Offeror shall submit a written description of the internal communication system utilized for effective and efficient project management including an organizational chart as well as tools used for cost and schedule tracking, cost estimating, and development of work breakdown schedules.  Offeror shall receive an Acceptable rating if the submitted information demonstrates an effective and efficient internal communication system is in place. An Offeror shall receive an Unacceptable rating if it demonstrates that it has no management internal communication system in place for project management or if the information demonstrates an inadequate management internal communication system is in place.
	Technical Factor 4: Laboratories (Proposed and actually used laboratories). This factor considers the proposed laboratories for sample analysis of ground water, soils and sediments. The factor considers the laboratories certification by the Navy or a state or local agency, qualifications of personnel and the quality of the sampling data.  Offeror shall submit a listing of the proposed laboratories with points of contact, telephone/fax numbers, addresses, e-mail addresses.  The offeror shall provide any certification information that the laboratory has received within the last year, the credentials of laboratory personnel, and a statement that the laboratory has an acceptable quality control plan in effect.  Offeror shall receive an Acceptable rating if it presents a proposed Laboratory which demonstrates that it has undergone outside certification, accreditation or licensing and includes the submittals stated in this factor. An Unacceptable rating would result if the proposed laboratories are not certified, accredited or licensed or the proposal fails to adequately address the required submittals.
	Technical Factor 5: Certified 29 CFR 1910.120 OSHA Safety Requirements.  This factor considers whether the firm or its employees have received and are certified in 29 CFR 1910.120 Safety Training.  Offeror shall submit current 29 CFR 1910.120 OSHA Safety training certification on all proposed key personnel.  Certification will be considered current if it is within twelve months of proposal submission date.  Offeror shall receive an Acceptable or Unacceptable rating, depending upon the number of current certified personnel on its staff that will be utilized on a BOA task order.  The types of personnel who should be certified are:  QA/QC personnel, Health & Safety personnel, Project Managers, and any other personnel proposed by the contractor.  An Acceptable rating will result from the offeror submitting documentation on the above listed personnel who have received the required OSHA Safety training and have presented the necessary current & up-to-date certification for these personnel.  The certifications shall also reflect that the training has been renewed on an as needed basis.  An Unacceptable rating will result from the offeror providing little or no accreditation or certificates or outdated certificates for its proposed cadre of personnel.  
	Technical Factor 6: Key Personnel Resumes (education, background, experience, type reports written, to whom). This factor considers the individual employees qualifications in RAO/LTM environmental work and their work experience, (e.g. the type projects they have worked on, degree of involvement in those projects and who/how they communicated with during the projects (i.e., written or verbal reports to clients, regulators, community members)). Education of the personnel is also a consideration for this factor. The offeror shall provide the resumes of the personnel they are proposing for this work.  An Acceptable rating will result from the preponderance of personnel resumes disclosing that education, work background, and experience demonstrate relevant and comprehensive experience with environmental RAO/LTM type work as set forth in the Scope of Work. An offeror that provides little or no information or provides resumes of proposed personnel that have little or no qualifying education or environmental RAO/LTM type experience will receive an Unacceptable rating.
Team Disclosure
		a.  Please disclose in your proposal any subcontractor teaming arrangements.  The name of the company, point of contact, address and telephone number shall be included.
		b.  In order to establish your bona fide place of business, only the information concerning the Prime 8(a) firm will be taken into account.  Although the non-8(a) firm teaming party may have many offices in multiple states, it is the Prime 8(a) firm who is responsible for establishing the bona fide place of business with the SBA for purposes of this solicitation.  The Prime 8(a) firm shall provide its bona fide office information (addresses, points of contact, telephone/fax, email addresses) for each of its office locations.
BOA Task Order Competition- Orders issued under the BOAs will be competed among BOA holders. Each solicitation for an order will indicate the degree of detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. The contractor will be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors as well as a price proposal.   LIMITATION OF ORDERS:  The average range will be from $5,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.   However, the Navy has no obligation to issue any orders under any BOA.
Competing for BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to those BOA holders in a given SBA District where the work will be performed. If sufficient competition or interest is not found in the given SBA District, the Navy will seek competition from adjacent districts by allowing those BOA holders to participate in the competition.
The proposals will be reviewed using either Trade-Off or Low Price Technically Acceptable best value criteria. The best value process may consider such factors as Understanding of the Work, Schedule, Past Performance, Laboratories, Key Personnel, Management Approach and Price.   Best Value is a method of evaluation, which allows the combination of technical considerations in combination with price to provide the greatest overall value to the Navy.  The RFP will inform the BOA holders of which best value method of evaluation will be utilized.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to modify the existing purchase order number 263-MJ-502086, issued as non-competitive award to Ms. Suzanne  M. Cole, 19020 Jamieson Dr, Germantown, MD  20874. Through competitive procedures a purchase order was issued to provide advice and to draft documentation involving a need to adapt or change NIDA administrative operations/organizations in order to meet higher level directives from NIH/DHHS/OMB.

Can they be improved?  Are key performance indicators missing?).  The contractor shall also review progress reports for qualitative information deemed helpful in describing the impact of the MCH Training Program.  The contractor shall develop a comprehensive, annual report and PowerPoint presentation based on analysis of information from performance indicators and progress reports.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Building Environment Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Arcadis G&M, Inc. of Durham, North Carolina, for a small chamber emission test system. 

The description of the system being procured is a small chamber emission test system to start research on development of a new emissions source standard reference material (SRM) as the starting point to developing an improved more accurate and repeatable small chamber emissions test method.

This notice of intent is based on market research that leads NIST to believe that only Arcadis G&M, Inc. can provide the item noted above.  Arcadus G&M, Inc. is the only vendor identified by NIST that has the technical ability required to be able to meet the specifications required to manufacture the EPA small chamber emission rate test chamber system for testing emissions from construction materials and household furnishings in the manner required to meet NIST’s needs (the specific need being: to develop a new SRM to be tested at NIST in other laboratories with the same EPA type chamber systems).  No other vendors were found that are able to design and manufacture small custom chambers, perform “in-house” testing, and installation of the chambers.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, parties authorized by Arcadis G&M, Inc.. that can provide the system. noted above may respond to this notice to indicate that they can provide it.  Such notice shall be provided by June 29, 2005.  The Government will then determine whether this procurement can be competed.  A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition will be based upon responses to this notice.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to enter into a SOLE SOURCE procurement with MAXIMUS, Inc. to manage and support a Ticket Program Data Operations Center (TPDOC) for access and utilization by two (2) Ticket Program support contractors, Operations Support Manager (OSM): SSA-RFP-05-1047 and Program Manager for Recruitment and Outreach (PMRO): SSA-RFP-06-1006, to satisfy the requirements of their respective contracts.  MAXIMUS is the only organization with the immediate system capability and familiarity with the Ticket Program requirements to provide the required services and the MAXIMUS system (MAXSTAR) is the only system alternative available to SSA within the established timeframes for awarding contacts to the OSM and the PMRO, of which immediate access to the TPDOC will be required to accomplish their respective contract requirements.  BACKGROUND: On September 29, 2000, SSA awarded a five-year contract to a Program Manager (PM), MAXIMUS, to assist the Agency in administering the Ticket Program by providing a wide variety of services in three main areas: (1) EN recruitment, (2) operations support, and (3) system access and support.  To meet Ticket Program support requirements following expiration of the current PM contract on September 28, 2005, the Agency will award two (2) contracts, the OSM and the PMRO.  Currently, Ticket Program operations are supported by an electronic information technology system/data base (MAXSTAR) proprietary to MAXIMUS.  MAXIMUS is responsible for the management and support of this system/data base and performs the following functions: (1) accesses and retrieves information from SSA control files, (2) updates SSA files, (3) accepts data inputs, and (4) generates management information and program data reports.  SSA plans to incorporate all of these activities into a separate TPDOC and award a contract to MAXIMUS to become the TPDOC Manager (TPDOCM).  The TPDOCM will continue to manage and support the existing system/database, update SSA files, and accept data inputs, as well as provide the OSM and the PMRO with necessary access and technical assistance.  REQUIREMENTS:  The TPDOCM shall continue to manage and support the existing system/data base and adjunct data bases, access and retrieve data from SSA control files, update SSA files, and accept data inputs, as well as provide the OSM and the PMRO with necessary TPDOC access and technical assistance.  Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Dawn Caracci via email at dawn.caracci@ssa.gov.  Responses shall be marked SSA-RFP-05-1052, CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received no later than JULY 8, 2005, 3:00PM EST.  All responsible sources will be considered.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date, a solicitation will be issued directly to MAXIMUS.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Dawn Caracci via the email address listed above.  Telephone calls will NOT be accepted. Reference Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center intends to issue a purchase order to Marriott at Metro Center for its bi-annual board meeting and guest room services for July 25 through July 29, 2005.  The Access Board is a Federal Agency that develops and maintains accessibility requirements that entities with responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act must meet.  The Board, both because of its members some with disabilities and because it must set a perfect example, can only use hotel space including individual rooms and meeting rooms that meet or exceed the Board’s accessibility guidelines.  Given the sensitivity of this issue, the Board will only use a hotel for meeting and rooms after the Boards staff has checked the hotel for accessibility compliance.  After checking several hotels in the DC area, Access Board staff concluded the Marriott at Metro Center is the only hotel that meets the unique needs of the Access Board for their meeting and individual room service requirements.

Specifically, the hotel has meeting rooms of the size and with accessibility options needed by the board and sleeping rooms available on the dates needed by the board (July 24-29).  The hotel has the required number of accessible rooms and most importantly, accessible rooms with roll-in showers.  All sections of the hotel have been found to meet or exceed the Access Boards standards.  The hotel is centrally located for the participants with great access for individuals with disabilities.  Nineteen occupants are planned from July 24-29 for the meeting space and each a room.  Needs vary but include roll-in showers, hearing impaired, and guide dog services.

 NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt-Administrative Resource Center will consider all affirmative responses received no later than July 1, 2005.  Affirmative responses shall reference ABA-02010-05-0050 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be issued to Marriott Hotel and Resort, 775, 12th street NW Washington DC 20005 for these services.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The scope of the project is remove two inches of surface material, compact the subbase, replace soft spots in the subbase, place two inches of asphalt on subbase, replace airfield marking, and adjust lights on the surface on each over run. Each over run is 250 feet wide and 1000 feet long. The most critical element of this project is that  flight operations must be  maintained. The east runway will be operational during the work on the west runway. The contractor shall coordinate with the Air Force on  traffic flow and FOD control. The contractor can only have access to the west runway for limited time periods (planes and construction equipment do not mix). The west runway is needed during bad weather since it is the instrumentation  runway. Depending o n how the money comes the contractor may be force to have two crews, one for each over run working at the same time. The contract duration may be limited to sixty days, thirty days for shop drawing and thirty days for construction. The bottom line is the c ontractor must have experience working on an active flight line

PROPOSED STUDY TO BE CONDUCTED FOR THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE/NORTHWEST FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER (NWFSC) IN SEATTLE, WA.  BACTERIA OF THE GENUS VIBRIO ARE UBIQUITOUS IN MARINE AND ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENTS AND INCLUDE SEVERAL SPECIES CAPABLE OF CAUSING HUMAN DISEASE.  VIBRIO SPECIES ARE PRIMARY CAUSE OF BACTERIAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH SEAFOOD AND AQUACULTURED PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE.  THESE BACTERIA PERSIST IN A WIDE RANGE OF TEMPERATURES AND SALINITIES, ASSOCIATE WITH AQUATIC FLORA AND CONCENTRATE IN SHELLFISH SUCH AS OYSTERS THROUGH FILTER-FEEDING.  IN THE U.S., THE MAJORITY OF SEAFOOD-RELATED, BACTERIAL INFECTIONS IN HUMANS ARE DUE TO TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SPECIES, VIBRIO VULNIFICUS AND VIBRIO PARAHAEMOLYTICUS.  V. PARAHAEMOLYTICUS PROLIFERATES IN TEMEPRATURE WATERS AND CAN CAUSE GASTROENTERITIS IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.  THIS PATHOGEN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAJOR OUTBREAKS OF ILLNESS IN 1997 IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, AND IN 1998 IN TEXAS AND NEW ENGLAND.  THESE CASES WERE ALL TRACED TO THE CONSUMPTION OF RAW OYSTERS.  CONTRACTOR WILL DEVELOP A RESEARCH PLAN TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT TYPE IV FIMBRIAL ADHESINS MEDIATE ADHERENCE TO EPITHELIAL CELLS AND INTESTINAL COLONIZATION IN AN ANIMAL MODEL.  CONTRACTOR WILL ALSO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SURFACE PROTEIN IRGA CONTRIBUTES TO THE ABILITY OF V. PARAHAEMOLYTICUS TO ADHERE TO EPITHELIAL CELLS AND COLNIZE THE INTESTING IN AN ANIMAL MODEL.

<DESC>NA Subject/Description:  The original FedBizOpps announcement posted date of 15 September 2003.   The original FedBizOpps announcement date 15 September 2003 incorrectly reflected a response date due by 30 September 2007.  Instructions within the actual MS Word 89 page Broad Agency Announcement attachment under Soliictation DAAB07-03-R-P650 found at th e Interactive Business Opportunities/Army Single Face to Industry Page (IBOP) via the World Wide Web at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil give the specific process on how and when to submit proposals by certain dates until the fiscal year 2007 timeframe.   The messages reflecting a 30 Sep 2007 timeframe posted on the ABOP on 15 and 16 Sep 2003 are correct.  It is the FedBizOpps original announcement that is hereby corrected. array antennas in these terminals will increase communications capability and decrease the probability of enemy detection/identification because of their smaller, conformal profile. This ManTech program will develop low cost materials, novel techniques and manufacturing processes that can be applied to high volume production of ferroelectric materials/devices for phased array antennas.  The On-the-Move SATCOM and UAV communication systems enabled by this program represent a new and unique communication system for the FCS Warfighter in the field.  The use of the ferroelectric phase shifters will reduce the size, weight and power consumptio n of phased array antennas.  Reliability is also expected to increase, although system reliability will still be limited by performance of MMIC power amplifiers.  (There are concurrent efforts to address this component.) 2.1 SCHEDULE:  This effort will start in FY 04 since the technology is mature enough to enter the ManTech program.  The first set of ferroelectric phase shifter device samples are required no later than six months from the start of the program.  Four addit ional sets of samples are required at 6-month intervals (total of five (5) sets).  This allows time for analyzing each batch and modifying the design and manufacturing processes to overcome problems.  Initial samples will be for the 18.5 to 21.2 GHz freque ncy range, followed by samples at 27.5 to 31 GHz and 43.5 to 45.5 GHz.  These frequency ranges are those required by PM WIN-T and FCS for use with Global Broadcast System, Wideband Gapfiller, MILSTAR and Advanced EHF satellites.  Packaging issues are addre ssed from the outset (and throughout the duration) of the program.  Advances in design and manufacturing processes must justifiably result in reduced loss, increased reliability and yield, and lower phase shifter cost.  Reliability testing will be conducte d on all samples.  Benchmark testing procedures will be developed to demonstrate and compare the performance of the actual ferroelectric components against predefined goals for performance, yield, reliability and operational lifetime.  Please note that dur ing the sample device testing sequence, devices will be randomly selected, enclosed in suitable packages, tested and analyzed. 2.2 PERFORMANCE:  Improved performance is an integral part of this program.  Note: Failure to meet the goals established in this SOW may lead to reduced funding for the ManTech program.  The following are the performance requirements which are required to be reported to US Army R&D Command on a quarterly basis:         FY05		   FY06	           FY07		       FY08 1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss	 9dB	        7dB	               6dB		           5dB Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Yield	35%	        50%	               60%	           80% Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Cost	 $50	        $30	               $15                      $10 2.3 Electrical Requirements: Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss			 Ã¢Â€Â“	18.5 - 21.2 GHz						3.0-5.0 dB max Ã¢Â€Â“	27.5 - 31.0GHz						3.5-5.5 dB max Ã¢Â€Â“	43.5 - 45.5 GHz						4.0-6.0 dB max Ã¢Â€Â¢	Return Loss								       15 dB min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Isolation								       15 dB min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output								50 ohm microstrip Ã¢Â€Â¢	Maximum Phase Shift						400 degrees min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Phase Variation over temp, voltage			Less than  11 degrees Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss variation over temp, voltage			Less than   3 dB Ã¢Â€Â¢	RF Power Handling Capability					100 mw Watt CW Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed						Less than 300 nanosecond Ã¢Â€Â¢	Total Settling Time					Less than 1 microsecond Ã¢Â€Â¢	Activation Voltage					Less than 30 Volts Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Consumption					Less than 4 mW Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching								Hot (RF applied) Ã¢Â€Â¢	Intermodulation Distortion						-22dBc Ã¢Â€Â¢	Size									0.8 x 1.7 mm max Ã¢Â€Â¢	Operational Lifetime					Less than 20 years 2.4 Test Methods (per MIL-STD 883E and MIL-PRF-38535J): Ã¢Â€Â¢	Screen Ã¢Â€Â“	Vi sual Inspection			M2010 Ã¢Â€Â“	Physical Dimensions			M2016 Ã¢Â€Â“	Stabilization Bake			M1008	Cond B, non-operating Ã¢Â€Â“	Thermal Shock				M1011.9	Cond B  -55oC to + 125oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Constant Acceleration			M2001.2	15,000G, Y1 axis only Ã¢Â€Â“	Serialization Ã¢Â€Â¢	Interim (Pre Burn-In) Electrical Parameters Ã¢Â€Â“	Loss vs voltage						-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Phase Shift vs Voltage					-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Burn-In						M1015.9	Cond B Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Interim (Post Burn-In) Electrical Parameters Ã¢Â€Â“	Loss vs voltage						-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Phase Shift vs Voltage					-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Percent Defective Allowable					5%, all lots Ã‚Â·	Group A  Electrical Tests Ã‚Â·	Static								-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output Return Loss Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output Impedance Ã¢Â€Â¢	Maximum Phase Shift Ã¢Â€Â¢	Activation Voltage 	Dynamic							-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss vs Voltage Ã¢Â€Â¢	Phase Shift vs Voltage Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed Ã¢Â€Â¢	Settling Time Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Consumption Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Handling Capability Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed Ã¢Â€Â¢	Intermodulation Distortion Ã‚Â·	Seal						M1014 Ã‚Â·	External Visual					M2009 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Group B Tests Ã¢Â€Â“	Resistance to Solvents		M2015 Ã¢Â€Â“	Bond Strength			M2011 Ã¢Â€Â“	Die Shear Strength			M2019 Ã¢Â€Â“	Solderability				M2003 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Group C Tests Ã¢Â€Â“	Life					M1016	TBD* Hours @ +TBDoC 									100 mw min RF power Ã¢Â€Â“	End-point electrical parameters *  Accelerated life test conditions will be proposed/developed by the offeror and approved by the Government to justify 20-year operational lifetime.

<DESC>The purpose of this message is to clarify BAA Solicitation DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic # S0404 Software Defined Radio. Amendment A00004 was issued December 9, 2003 with proposals to be submitted NLT COB 16 Jan 04.  That specific technical based amendment was issued only with the intent of developing a prototype Power Amplifier (PA) capable of operating between 400 to 970 M Hz and 1200 to 2000 MHz. This specific requirement of Amendment A00004 does not cancel out the original intent of the basic Topic S0404 Software Defined Radio that is still active.   Each of the 25 Topics stands on its own for the submission of white papers / and or proposals. Each of the 25 CECOM CERDEC S&TCD Topics has its own suspense date for FY 04 with their own individual suspense dates and proposal/white paper procedures. The ma jority of the topic suspense dates is 14 May 2004 for FY 2004 requirements and associated funding including BAA Topic S0404.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during the life of this BAA.  However, proposals should not be submitted any later than 14 May per year to be considered for award in the fiscal year of submission. The Government may award a contract, based on a proposal received in response to this BAA, anytime during the life of this BAA. Technical Contact: Rosie Bauer, 732-427-3707 or Celeste Boucher at 732-427-2768 if necessary. For more indepth BAA solicitation information,  interested parties should see the basic BAA Solicitation, exisiting amendments and be alert for any future BAA amendments that may be published on the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Single Face to Industry Page or otherwise kno wn as ABOP Web page located at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil

<DESC>Low Cost Ferroelectric Phase Shifters for Phased Arrays Clarification to BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401 See the US Army CECOM Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at abob.monmouth.army.mil under BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401, Amendment A00006  MS Word attachment for fine details or clarifications to the description of this Topic reflected below.  1.1 ARMY NEED:  The Army is pursuing technologies to meet transformation goals of a lighter, faster, more lethal force with integrated on-the-move communications from sensor to shooter.  Affordable Phased Arrays provide the means for this high data rate, B eyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS), on-the-move communications.  The Army Objective Force and Transformational Communications Architecture require small, low profile, affordable, mobile SATCOM terminals. The major contributor to the cost of phased array antennas i s the current high cost ($50-100) of packaged Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) phase shifters.  Ferroelectric phase shifters provide a low cost option for these costly items. The successful completion of this ManTech program will result in a cost reduction of up to 33% for SATCOM and UAV phased arrays for FCS and WIN-T operating in the K, Ka and Q frequency bands.  PM efforts affected include the WIN-T communications vehicle an d PM WIN-T Multifunction Integrated SATCOM Terminal (MIST).  Neither of these efforts will be able to utilize phased array antenna systems without the cost reductions provided by this ManTech program. 1.2 TECHNICAL CONCEPT:  This ManTech program leverages and builds upon DARPA, ARL and CECOM programs addressing the development of ferroelectric phase shifters.  Specific programs include the DARPA Frequency Agile Materials for Electronics (FAME) program, the ARL SBIR program for development of ferroelectric phase shifters, and a subcontract for ferroelectric phase shifters under the CECOM DUST (Dual Use Science & Technology) program for low cost phased arrays (STO IV.G.07, Antennas Across the Spectrum and STO IIII.C4.2001.02, Advanced Antennas).  These efforts, however, only address the initial development of ferroelectric phase shifters.  This ManTech program is expected to reduce costs by establishing cost effective manufacturing methods and techniques of  fabrication and packaging. Specific goals of this ManTech program are to:  Ã‚Â·	Improve device design and fabrication processes Ã‚Â·	Reduce device application voltage Ã‚Â·	Reduce loss of ferroelectric devices from 9 dB to  5 dB Ã‚Â·	Develop low cost packaging techniques Ã‚Â·	Package-less solder bump bonded ferroelectric phase shifter Ã‚Â·	Increase operational lifetime to  20 years Ã‚Â·	Reduce phase shifter device cost from $50 to $10. 1.3 BENEFITS:  This effort will yield significantly less expensive (from  $50 to  $10) phase shifters for phased array antennas.  Additionally, it will identify potential low-cost technologies for robust, mobile, embedded antenna systems that can replace t he current high-cost solutions.  These cost reductions will help reduce antenna costs to a level where it becomes practical to utilize these antennas extensively in tactical communications systems.  The ultimate goal of this ManTech program is to make the procurement costs of Phased Array Antenna systems feasible for the WIN-T and FCS communications architectures (including FCS UoA (Unit of Action) and UoE (Unit of Employment) vehicles with embedded SATCOM).  These antenna systems will provide a new high da ta rate, On-The-Move communications capability via Satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  (This capability is specifically addressed in the WIN-T ORD and the FCS Block II requirements.)  Affordable phased array antennas are a key component of the Transf ormation Communications (TC) terminal technology insertion/phasing plans.  As part of TCS, the Transformational SATCOM (TSAT) terminals include the technology insertion of phased array antennas in the 2005 -  2009 time frame.  Having phased

The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.  Please note this  document falls under "DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to  Department of Defense and DOD Contractors only to protect technical or  operational data..."  To receive a copy of the SRD, please send an email  request to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only). It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attention Capt Thompson,  by COB 18 March 2005.

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."

U.S. Small Business Administration
Office of Procurement & Grant Management
409 Third Street, SW, Suite 5000
Washington, DC 20416
Attention: Maria Manga


RESPONSE DATE: JULY 14, 2005 AT 14:00 Eastern time


ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS:

The SBA requires contractors to develop and support initiatives proposed by American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians and non-profit organizations for economic development projects on disadvantaged and underserved Indian reservations and tribal areas that will empower Native American entrepreneurs in accordance with the attached statement of work.


Office of Native American Affairs
Native American Economic Development Projects

Statement of Work

Background

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), through its Office of Native American Affairs (ONAA), is continuing the Native American initiative begun in FY 2003 that will provide economic development services to small businesses.  SBA will work closely with American Indians, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians, tribal governments, tribal colleges, Indian organizations, and other Federal agencies, as well as the private sector, to supplement and support the Indian nations’ plan for economic stimulus.  

Scope

The SBA/ONAA will support economic development projects that represent the interests of American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians.

1.  The projects must have the ability to meet the objective of providing increased entrepreneurial development opportunities for American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians

2.  The projects must have the potential to become “best practices” for implementation by other entities around the country.

3.  Each project must specify the targets/ milestones, and deliverables to be met to ensure completion of agreed-upon targets, goals, and outcomes.

4.  The projects must include viable plans for identifying alternate funding options so that successful projects can continue without further SBA funds.

5. Examples of some of the economic development projects SBA contemplates include but are      not limited to the following:

•	Establishing cooperatives to allow American Indian, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian small business owners to obtain economies of scale, including better pricing for equipment, supplies and services (e.g., accounting, insurance, employee benefits, payroll services, etc.), more efficient inventory systems and distribution networks and shared marketing, etc.
•	Setting up peer roundtables (taking advantage of teleconferencing or other electronic tools when feasible) to share information, experiences and best practices, to problem-solve, and to provide outside expert consultation.
•	Developing and implementing strategies to increase Internet access for individuals residing on remote locations such as tribal lands and rural areas (e.g. assisting Indian tribes to establish Internet Service Provider (ISP) companies.)
•	Developing and supporting non-traditional business structures (such as home-based businesses, agribusinesses, aqua-farming, folk art, etc.) and niche markets including exporting, e-commerce, trade and tourism, etc.
•	Establishing local resource centers to provide American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians entrepreneur’s access to the most current resources available, including the necessary hardware and software to access information online.
•	Developing and implementing quality training, counseling and access to resources to specialized target groups such as Youth Entrepreneurs, Veterans, active Military and Reservist. 

6.  Deliverable products could include activities such as:

•	Business Training Programs					
•	Brochures								
•	Website Development						
•	Business counseling						


7.  The contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities to perform the tasks listed in this Statement of Work.

8.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that all personnel working on this project have adequate training to perform their assigned tasks.  Any courses or other training needed to ensure that staff skills are commensurate with the work to be performed are the responsibility of the Contractor and shall be undertaken at no direct cost to this contract.

9. A construction project is permissible if it meets all of the criteria in the RFP/statement of work, and if it falls within the total budgeted amount.


Place of Performance

Work may be performed at the contractor’s offices or on site as necessary.  Proposals must state where work will be performed.

Period of Performance

The period of performance is one year from date of award.

Government Furnished Items

The government will not furnish items outside the scope of the contract unless otherwise provided for in this Statement of Work. 



Reporting

By the 15th of each month the contractor is expected to submit monthly activity reports to the SBA Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) on progress against targets/milestones, and include any recommendations regarding performance/deliverables to demonstrate proper monitoring of project performance and completion of agreed-upon targets, goals, and outcomes.  Any schedule adjustments will be agreed-upon between the contractor and SBA management, and the implementation strategy will be modified accordingly.  A standardized monthly reporting template will be provided by SBA/ONAA or information requirements for monthly reporting will be provided by SBA/ONAA.

Contractor is required to report client activity data and provide copies of intake forms associated with all services provided to clients on behalf of the SBA in the Entrepreneur Development Management Information System (EDMIS).  The SBA will provide the contractor with EDMIS training and access.

Invoices

By the 15th of each month the contractor is to submit an invoice to the SBA COTR, covering all services rendered during the preceding monthly time period with sufficient detail to clearly explain all services provided and the corresponding portion of the total price incurred under this contract.  The invoices are to clearly match against the agreed-upon contract terms, and maintain an accounting of cumulative charges and available balances.


Funding

SBA will not approve for funding any contract that includes any provisions requiring the clients to be served to pay for any related services, or to make payments to the contractor based on the success of the ventures assisted.

<DESC>Update:  Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June 2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and current  contractors working in SIMAF.  A request was also received for contact  information of companies participating in Industry Days.  Both have been added  to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions received during Industry Day and anticipate posting  answers by 6 July 2005. *************************************************************   Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14 Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS  library.  ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal of  the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th will be  extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked about the  SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.  Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may  contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code,  etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function.  Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email?  ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please  allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC  submittals  to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO  will confirm receipt of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14 June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to  industry via PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings will be loaded to PIXS and will  available for download by COB 15 Jun 05. ****************************************************************************** Update:  Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 The following sentences have been modified in the following synopsis to  reflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

General questions received from industry will be loaded to the XR-SIMAF PIXS  library below. Set 1 of Questions and Answers (Q+A) are available in the PIXS  library as “Set 1 Q+A”.   ****************************************************************************** XR-SIMAF Capabilites Integration Services 17 May 05 Sources Sought Announcement Description The Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Development and  Integration Directorate (ASC/XR) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH anticipates a  full and open competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) FY05Qtr 04 for  performance-based services valued at approximately $90M in FY06 – FY10.   Constructive simulation, virtual simulation, and capabilities analyses support  services are sought for the Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) and  ASC/XR. The ASC/XR Mission is effects-based planning to maximize efficiency in  delivering war-winning capability. XR provides planning interfaces across the  aeronautical enterprise and to MAJCOM and HQ AFMC processes. Collaborative  modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of  capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS)  concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of  security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the  appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems  acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through  sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation  studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and  support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are  anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below  which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three,  four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is  shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to  simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and  protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols;  and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in  PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution  activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or  assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities,  analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more  detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies,  virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for  simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses  areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality,  mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems  architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional  Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which  will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support;  Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the  Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF  Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support,  and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and  hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation  operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware,  Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems,  Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see  Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise  processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are  anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists  of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical  Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings,   the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support  to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets,  architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru  Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be  tasked thru task order might include participating in project System  Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group  meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to  include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop  simulations, etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test  plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects  in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in  planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a  specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer  Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 78,000 labor  hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a  total three year CORE effort of approximately 258,000 labor hours. The two  option years have an estimated 90,000 labor hours each. Customer events will  be supported using task orders.  Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of  intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor  Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR  awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is  anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied  upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and  Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees  will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret  clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although  they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All  personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should  be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any  resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these  contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award,  foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or  technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified  information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling,  Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition,  exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and  scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to  submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration. Firms having the capability to  perform one or more functions A – D (or E with one of the above) are invited  to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to  determine the appropriate small businesses strategy.  Based on the results of  the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside one or more  functions of this requirement for small businesses or to develop innovative  small business goals or arrangements.  Offerors shall indicate whether they  are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone  certified, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, veteran owned, or  Historically Black College/University and against which function(s) they are  submitting their SOC, and if your interest is as a prime contractor or as a  subcontractor.     The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the  offerors capabilities to perform in the specified five critical support  functions.  For each functional area (and the associated addendum) to which  you plan to respond, please answer the following questions.   1.	What is your experience in this functional area (as described in this  announcement and in the Appendix)?  Please include detailed examples, duration  and scope of relevant past work, including names and phone numbers of POCs.   2.

<DESC>This sources sought is a request for information prior to drafting and releasing any resultant solicitation.  The information contained in this sources sought notification is based on the best and most current information available to date, is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.  Any significant changes will be provided in subsequent synopsis, if required.  The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) is seeking potential sources, large and small businesses capable of providing support of both a programmatic and information technology (IT) nature.  The programmatic work involves communicating with and instructing field personnel around the world and researching prior U.S. weapons sales and grants to foreign countries.  The IT work requires one or more software programmers proficient in Java.  The work is to be performed in the Mechanicsburg PA area.  DSCA is responsible for planning, coordinating, administering, and supervising Department of Defense (DOD) programs for transfer of defense articles, services, and technology, by sale or grant, to foreign governments and international organizations.  These programs include Foreign Military Sales (FMS) under which defense articles and services are sold to foreign countries or international organizations, Foreign Military Financing (FMF) under which grants or loans are provided to foreign countries for financing of FMS or direct commercial contracts with U.S. industry, International Military Education and Training (IMET) under which financial assistance is provided to foreign students attending U.S. military schools, and Humanitarian Assistance and Mine Action (HA/MA) under which support is provided to foreign governments.  In value, these programs total billions of dollars annually, and DSCA is responsible for directing and supervising them from inception through completion, accounting, and reporting.  In addition, DSCA develops computer applications, unique to the Security Cooperation mission, to support the business processes of both DSCA Headquarters and other elements of DoD that execute the mission.  Detailed responsibilities of the Agency are set forth in DOD Directive 5105.65.  DSCA headquarters is located in Arlington, VA.  DSCA’s  Global Programs Directorate manages a family of Security Cooperation programs that have worldwide scope.  These include: International Military Education and Training (IMET), Humanitarian Assistance and Mine Action that provides disaster assistance, pre-planned humanitarian programs, and training in elimination of landmines, End-Use Monitoring that assures that critical military hardware, sold or granted to other countries, is not diverted to inappropriate parties or uses. The EUM application has the following major areas of functionality: Secure internet access for SAOs and Host Nation Inspectors, Inventory and disposition records by defense article, country, and combatant command, A Planned inventory report, based on the previous inventory date for each defense article and an established frequency of inspection, A Delinquent Inventory report based on past due inspections, An item inventory History, Ad Hoc reporting capability, including the ability to save queries for reuse, Input capability to establish and correct inventory records, Ability to confirm each item of inventory by serial number, The ability to defer a scheduled inspection when a particular item may be deployed or otherwise unavailable for inspection, The ability to attach notes (for historical purposes) to aid in subsequent inventory inspections by successors, The ability to adjust, deplete, or transfer inventory records, The ability to trace the origin of an item to the USG program that furnished it, Provision of reference tools and the latest EUM policy and procedural guidance. The EUM application currently reads and/or writes to the 21 data tables.  The application resides in 35 Java gadgets and is organized into 6 sections with a total of 34 possible major screens.  It was initially estimated to be about 580 function points in size, but has likely grown since then as additional features were added to the original design. The data to be populated in the EUM database includes military articles provided as far back as 1950 via the (then active) Military Assistance Program (MAP). The critical elements to be obtained for each weapon in the database are the type of weapon, the serial number, the associated Military Articles and Services List nomenclature, and the type of program under which the article was transferred to another country.  This data, and particularly serial numbers, are not currently held centrally in DoD.  Rather they are distributed among various System Commands, program offices, and manufacturers.  Consequently a major outreach effort is required to obtain the needed data.  This is being approached on a weapon-by-weapon, manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis. DSCA is hereby seeking to identify firms capable of providing the following services: EUM user support, EUM weapons data research, EUM weapons data loading, EUM program analysis, EUM software applications maintenance and enhancement and Program Management Support.  If you are interested in competing for this requirement, please indicate your interest by sending an email no later than July 1, 2005 at 3:00 P.M. EST to Mr. Mark Scher, email:  Mark.Scher@dsca.mil, Mr. Leon Yates, email:  Leon.Yates@dsca.mil, Ms. Toye Latimore, email:  Toye.Latimore@dsca.mil and Mr. Julian Boggan, email:  Julian.Boggan@dsca.mil. The email should contain the following subject lines.  Sources Sought, DSCA EUM Monitoring Program.  Use of any other subject line may delay your entry.  All valid email responses from prospective sources must provide the return email address, company name, mailing address, telephone number and point of contact within the body of the response.  In addition, to assist in the acquisition strategy development, please respond to the following questions: 1) Is your business a small business [Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, etc]? 2) Provide a list of customers (Government/non-Government) within the past 5 years highlighting similar work performed.

Other pertinent information:  Email responses without the aforementioned information or without responding to all receiptants will not be recognized as valid.  ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS MUST RESPOND TO THIS SYNOPSIS VIA EMAIL.  TELEPHONIC REQUEST FOR SOLICITATIONS AND OR INFORMATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED, RETURNED OR ACKNOWLEDGED. If an offeror seeks information from Technical Representative, your electronic response will not be accepted. The Government reserves the right to conduct oral capabilities demonstrations that will be scheduled at a later date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is considering the introduction of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) capabilities to support a net-centric transformation of DOD warfighting, business and intelligence capabilities.  This is a request for information (RFI) from industry on innovative approaches to support the adoption of web-service technologies and the evolution of an SOA across the DOD.  This RFI includes, but is not limited to, SOA techniques, web service technologies and foundation-level service definitions and specifications.  All web-service and SOA technology suppliers and consultants are offered this opportunity to show how to best employ their capabilities within the DOD enterprise. 
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives to determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for NCES SOA foundation capabilities.  The Government requests that no proprietary information be provided in response to this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
INTRODUCTION: 
The Net Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) program is charged with providing foundational capabilities that will be used to support a net-centric transformation of DOD warfighting, business and intelligence capabilities.  The goal of net-centricity is to significantly improve DOD operations by making all trustworthy information resources available to all appropriate entities within the DOD, while denying our enemies the ability to benefit from, or to exploit our reliance on, these resources and capabilities.  Objectives include: 
--Interoperability:  Integration of information and applications across networks, heterogeneous technologies, and organizational boundaries.  Exposing information and applications as consumable services to facilitate application and data sharing 
--Agility: Flexible IT environment in which new capabilities can rapidly be added and existing capabilities can be dynamically reconfigure to meet changing operational requirements.
--Visibility:  Common understanding of requirements and capabilities among consumers, planners, and providers across the DOD enterprise
--Transformation: Close alignment of IT with business and warfighting processes and mission requirements
To meet these objectives, NCES will provide the foundational capabilities to support a web services based service-oriented architecture (SOA).  NCES currently views these foundation capabilities to include the utility and environmental services needed to facilitate and govern service producer and service consumer interaction across the DOD enterprise.   At the core of this net centric foundation are service-oriented architecture (SOA) technologies that represent an emerging approach to developing interactive IT resources that will enable a new generation of highly adaptable and interoperable capabilities that fully leverage the resources locked within our current stovepipe systems. 
INFORMATION REQUEST:
1.  What innovated technologies should DISA consider for developing and fielding the software infrastructure services necessary to support the implementation and evolution of a SOA within the DOD enterprise?
a.  What core services should be offered as components of a DOD services infrastructure
b.  Do the appropriate technologies exist to provision and maintain these core services in an enterprise as large, diverse and complex as the DOD. 
c.  How can/should we mitigate technology risks in adopting rapidly evolving web services technologies?  Can you suggest technology risk mitigation strategies or best practices.
d.  How can we maximize the flexibility and reusability of core services? 
2.  In addition to specific technologies, there appear to be many options on the approach to acquiring these technologies for the DOD.  What innovative acquisition approaches should be considered to effectively balance the government's need for fast access to rapidly changing technology and incentivized contractor performance, with stability in program management, contract performance, risk management and community adoption of DISA provided services?  Potential acquisition challenges may include:
a.  Establishing criteria and approach for evaluating alternatives to maximize and maintain a competitive environment to drive best value to the government while minimizing risk to the government and impact to existing customers
b.  Establishing appropriate criteria, metrics and reporting mechanisms as part of an acquisition performance management strategy 
c.  Ability to acquire NCES capabilities in successive, interoperable, increments to achieve incremental success and take advantage of rapidly evolving technologies 
d.  Maintaining mission and functional stakeholder participation to ensure effective governance, change management and communication
ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION: 
Please limit responses to 20 pages and submit one soft copy in a Microsoft Office compatible format to the Acquisition Liaison, Mr. Michael Warwick, at michael.warwick@disa.mil.  Email size is limited to 3MB.  
The Government may request additional information or discuss information received in responses to this RFI with individual responders. DISA shall consider meeting individually with interested respondents.  Submissions should occur by 25 Jul 05.

<DESC>Air Education and Training Command Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB, TX, seeks potential sources for a government acquisition for a comprehensive instructional methodology to teach enduring leadership competencies as defined in AF Doctrine Document 1-1 (AFDD1-1) to Squadron Officer School (SOS) students to include lesson plans and an accompanying Leadership Development Simulator (LDS) to provide “hands-on” training to reinforce and apply the lessons.  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up requests.  

The instructional process will be as follows:
1.	The students are taught a leadership competency from the lesson plan
2.	The students play an LDS scenario designed to focus on that competency
3.	The instructor replays and analyzes the game.
4.	The instructor leads the class in a guided discussion pointing out their successes, failures, and lessons learned

The instructional methodology must support leadership theories and models which have been validated by independent, industry leading organizations.  Leadership instruction must be based on academically credibly, peer-critiqued leadership theory.  This extends, but is not limited to leadership, information technology, and communications theories and models used to generate the design.  To ensure the ultimate efficacy of the simulation to produce predictable, behavioral responses, the LDS design must use documented lessons learned from previous IT-based team leadership development simulators.  

Leadership Competencies

Each lesson must support a tactical competency of leadership, or associated concepts, as defined by AFDD1-1.  Each lesson must contain both a written lesson script and an LDS programmed scenario that supports it.  Potential concepts and leadership competencies, include, but are not limited to:

	- Exercising Sound Judgment
		-- Attribution Bias
		-- Decision Theory
		-- Problems in Perception
		-- Escalation of Commitment

	- Promote Teamwork and Collaboration
		-- Collective Traps
		-- Competition vs Collaboration
		-- Social loafing
		-- Role conflict and role expectations
		-- Conformity vs dissent
		-- Group polarization

	- Adapt and Perform Under Pressure
		-- Risk Seeking/Aversion
		-- Cheating 
	
	- Lead Courageously
		-- Taking responsibility for your actions
		-- Holding others responsible for their actions

Leadership Development Simulator (LDS)

The LDS is a game-based IT application for the purpose of teaching and practicing specific leadership techniques and competencies.   It will act as a problem solving presentation platform from which different scenarios will be presented to a team.  It will also function as a documentation agent recording all user input and system output.  This feature will allow the scenario to be recreated at a later time for analysis purposes.  The game should be designed such that a team can only accomplish their mission by working together.  The contractor will provide scenarios designed to focus on each of the leadership competencies taught in the lesson plan, but the application design should allow the AF is create their own scenarios.  The LDS situations should be designed to expose the students to situations where most people would make mistakes leading to “teachable moments” when students are suddenly more open to learning about alternative ways of handling team-related problems.  Although success should be possible, the students should be provided an opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them in the classroom environment.

The purpose of the LDS is to allow students to develop and practice their leadership competencies.  Its interface should be user friendly and easy to learn, but realistic graphical representations of air battle are discouraged since it may distract from the purpose of teaching leadership competencies.

The contractor shall design and develop a simulation that elicits and targets behavioral responses found in AFDD 1-1.  The LDS design shall be based on a team command and control context.  The application must have the ability for at least 12 users, working as a team, to employ a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to avoid threats and accomplish specific missions.  Each UAV must have specific capabilities and weaknesses.  These attributes, along with the rules and speed of play, must be modifiable to provide an example of, or reinforce, the desired leadership behaviors or concepts.  The object of the game should be to eliminate enemy targets while minimizing losses to enemy defenses.  The game should be configured such that a team can only accomplish their mission by working together.

The team will have a leader, who will coordinate the actions of each of the other members.  The students, in the role of Air Battle Mangers, will develop an Air Tasking Order (ATO) that will provide orders to UAVs.   Each student will be responsible for a number of different UAVs that they can task to accomplish the overall mission of the team.  The object of the task is to monitor restricted airspace and prevent enemy aircraft from entering forbidden locations by detecting them, identifying them, and attacking them if necessary.   The object of the game should be to eliminate enemy targets while minimizing losses to enemy defenses.   

The game should proceed based on an ATO cycle and use the relevant verbiage associated with air operations employment.   In accordance with the ATO cycle, players must have an opportunity to assess the situation, discuss the potential options, select the best alternative, and build a tasking order that will be inputted into the simulator.  The students will not interact with the simulator while the scenario is running.  The simulator must provide rolling output that will show the results of their decisions in both text and graphical formats.  At the beginning of the game, users will have control of a variety of UAVs with different capabilities such as attack, close air support, refueling, and intelligence collection.  The exact mixture of assets will be configurable and based on the specific learning objectives.  The game shall also include a mixture of enemy threats and targets which all originate in the 12 x 12 enemy territory area (see Appendix A). Fixed threats and targets stay in the same place throughout the game, but mobile threats and targets can move from one space to an adjacent space each round.

Four different (instructor configurable) sources of computer delivered intelligence shall be made available to the team during the game.  Each source shall have different levels of reliability and validity.  These levels shall also have the ability to be modified and dependent upon specific regions of the territory map.   The LDS must have the ability to host any number of teams and be played on most any existing Microsoft Windows network environment.  The LDS must easily allow different scenarios to be inputted for play to accommodate the application of several concepts or leader behaviors.  It must record and output in a readable format, all user input and system output.  The design must allow students to be trained on the simulator in less than one hour.

The LDS must operate in a Microsoft Windows networked environment.  It needs to perform all functions and satisfy all requirements on a sub GHz machine with 256K RAM and a 30 GB hard drive.  The operating system shall be any variant of Microsoft Windows NT such as Windows XP.  

It cannot be stressed enough that the scope of this project goes well beyond the development of a software application.  The vendor will be required to develop instructional methodology and lesson plans to ensure instructors and students can explore their leadership experiences.  Leadership instruction must be based on academically credibly, peer-critiqued leadership theory that is congruent with the LDS’s effect.  In essence, we want a computer game that a team can play, experience common leadership dilemmas, then discuss this experience in a guided discussion in class. These requirements hinge on the prevailing need for expertise in the field of leadership.  This expertise is the ultimate deliverable which will manifest itself through new curriculum, lesson plans, a validated experiential simulation, and faculty training.  SOS has experimented heavily with computer games and simulations to facilitate leadership development, the school’s primary mission.  On all accounts, these simulations have failed toward that end.  This failure can be attributed to their original design.  None of these simulations were designed to teach leadership and, more importantly, elicit leader behaviors with consistency and validity.  Understanding leader and team behavior and translating this into predictable code is a critical attribute.  This is why the dual expertise of leadership theory/behavior and application development is so critical in this ambitious and compelling venture.

<DESC>NOTE:  This is only a Request for Information (RFI), not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and all information received will be for planning purposes only.  The CE-LCMC Acquisition Center does not intend to award a contract on the basis of your responses nor otherwise pay for the preparations of any information presented or the use of any such information.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  The response date for this RFI is 22 July 2005.  Technical Point of Contract is Mr. Frank Pasqua lino, Phone 703-704 2933 or email frank.pasqualino@atccs.belvoir.army.mil.   The Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) is an ACAT II Program that provides actionable logistics information to commanders at all echelons, Brigade and above.  The program falls under the U. S. Armys Procurement Executive Officer for Communic ations, Command and Control - Tactical (PEO C3T); the Program Manager, Ground Combat Command and Control (PM-GCC2); and the Product Manager, Battle Command Sustainment Support System (PdM BCS3).  The BCS3 is part of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) an d, incorporates the overarching interoperability, integration, and common requirements of the ABCS.  When used in conjunction with C2 systems at Corps or Army Force Headquarters, BCS3 facilitates the transmission of logistics information to the User Define d Operational Picture (UDOP) at the operational level.  Currently, system performance includes display of friendly locations display of enemy situation, provide elements of the Armys Running Estimate for current combat power, future combat power, log re lated Commanders Critical Information Requirement (CCIR) alerts, logistical Course Of Action (COA) analysis, input to the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP), in transit and total asset visibility, map based displays, interoperability with enabling co mmand and control and business (STAMIS) systems.  The current software version ABCS 6.4 is the last major version of BC capability that will only be incrementally and selectively enhanced to interoperate with the Future Combat System (FCS), Battle Command and Joint Command and Control (JC2).  Of primary importance to the BCS3 system is maintaining the linkage and exchange of information with other ABCS systems, especially Maneuver Control System (MCS) and Force Battle Command Brigade-and-Below / Blue Force Tracker (FBCB2/BFT), while supporting the migration of select current battle command capabilities to JC2 and FCS. The migration from current to future capabilities is focused on the merger of Global Command and Control System (GCCS) family of systems to JC 2 and migration of ABCS family of systems into both JC2 and FCS.  FCS will spiral forward some lead items into the current force to deliver early available capabilities early. Throughout the process selected commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off- the-shelf (GOTS), standards and technologies will be inserted into the ABCS 6.4 baseline.  BCS3 will also integrate a tailorable Microsoft Office-like Suite with exportable reports, briefing products, and additional Decision Support Tools that can be used by the other ABCS programs.  Sources are sought to take the existing BCS3 system and maintain and enhance its performance.  Significant efforts include software development for new functionalities that support battle command capabilities at all echelons of  command and provide interoperability with Joint, Interagency, and Multinational coalition forces battle command systems as well as ensure training sustainment capabilities are fielded and resourced and ensure technology advancements and experimentation r esults are incorporated into the battle command development process; software enhancement/sustainment efforts to increase availability, effectiveness and/or efficiency; worldwide fielding and logistical support that includes but is not limited to LAN accre ditation, set-up, and configuration; full-range of training for the BCS3 system to include tailored over-the-shoulder training for senior staffs; worldwide field support, Interim Contractor Support that currently includes embedded on-site field support personnel; a 24/7 help desk; server support; hardware and software warranty support ; Program Management Office support; and hardware and software purchases of the BCS3 system if needed.

<RESPDATE>071105
<ARCHDATE>09092005
<CONTACT>Ronald Lopez, 520-533-2254
<DESC>The Communications Electronics Life Cycle Management Command is conducting market research for purposes of identifying sources that can provide the following Type I NSA certified piece of equipment. The KG-250 is a Type 1 In-line Network Encryptor (INE) that is currently in development. Description: The KG-250 is an INE device designed to provide Type 1 encryption for network users, allowing them to securely pass Internet Protocol (IP) data packets cl assified up to TOP SECRET/SCI across private internets, wide area networks (WANs), or the public Internet. It is a plug-and-play device that functions similarly to a router on the secure network. The KG-250 is simple to administer because it uses network p rotocols to perform most of the configuration and path discovery dynamically. It provides a trusted IP header bypass function, which allows data packets to navigate through the standard wide-area commercial infrastructure to secure destination networks. Us er sensitive (Red Side) IP headers are able to be hidden from the unclassified (Black Side) of the network. The KG-250 interfaces to the secure network and to the WAN via Ethernet connections located on the chassis. The KG-250 provides strong security feat ures: secure-side net management, data integrity, mandatory and discretionary access control, unique-key-per-packet encryption, transmission security, and scheduled net key rollover. The KG-250 architecture is designed to support the High Assurance IP Inte rface Specification (HAIPIS) requirements developed by the NSA to ensure future IP INE interoperability. All features (networking and cryptography) are programmable, ensuring all future HAIPIS updates can be easily integrated into the KG-250 with minimal o peration impact. Application: As an INE, the KG-250 is inserted between the classified user host(s) or workstation(s) and the unclassified network. It receives data from Ethernet (802.3), performs access control and encryption, and transmits the encrypted data to the WAN via its Ethernet interface. The KG-250 provides single-level, system-high data encryption, and can accommodate network partitioning into communities of interest (COI). Certification: The KG-250 is NSA Type 1 certified for all classification  levels up to and including TS/SCI U.S. Government information. Classification: The KG-250 is designated as a Controlled Cryptographic Item (CCI). CCI products are unclassified, but controlled, when unkeyed. When keyed, the KG-250 is classified to the high est level of the traffic key it contains. Components: The KG-250 consists of the stand-alone INE equipment, an external power supply, User Documentation, and miscellaneous accessories. Ancillaries: The KG-250 and associated software provides key management , network configuration, routing, and auditing services. Other ancillary equipment includes cables, connectors, power supplies, and a rack-mounting adapter with an integral power supply for use with a 19 inch rack. Dimensions: Height: 1.6 inches (42.7 mm),  Width: 7.50 inches (149.3 mm), Depth: 11.9 inches (304.8 mm), Weight: 6.5 lbs (3 Kg) Approximately. Power: +5 VDC and +3.3 VDC. Environment: Fixed Plant.  VENDORS THAT ARE CABAPLE OF PROVIDING THIS TYPE I encryption equipment please provide your capabilit y statements and certifications to contract specialist kathleen.a.camp@us.army.mil or contracting officer diane.brown3@us.army.mil

<DESC>Technology Risk Reduction Effort Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) Rapid Response Kit Capability  BAA No. DJC2-05-01   POC: Mr. Lawson Hynson  Proposals Due:  Monday, 25 July 2005  E-Mail: theodore.hynson@navy.mil Fax: 850/234-4197  DJC2 Web: https://www.djc2.org/index.asp (project information including BAA and proposal preparation instructions.)  (Note that this site is password controlled.  Users must register at the site prior to gaining access to the BAA information) NSWC PC Web: http://www.ncsc.navy.mil/Contracts/ZTables/BAAtab.htm  (BAA and proposal preparation instructions) 1.  INTRODUCTION The Deployable Joint Command and Control Program Office is soliciting proposals under this BAA to perform research, development, and prototyping to support the Deployable Joint Command and Control System (DJC2) Increment II Technology Demonstration (Pre-Milestone B).  The main goal of the DJC2 program is to create a cost-effective, superior means to deploy, set up, install, operate, and maintain a Joint Command and Control (C2) Combat Operations Center (COC).  DJC2 provides a modular and rapidly reconfigurable suite of hardware, networking, supporting infrastructure, and mobility components, as well as limited organic en route and early-entry communications capabilities.  In Increment I, DJC2 is migrating toward the DoD Net Centric and Global Information Grid-Enterprise Services (GIG-ES) architectures.  A Rapid Response Kit, the focus of this BAA, is an anticipated Increment II configuration change for a standalone light system capable of being transported by one or two pers! ons as checked baggage on commercial and military aircraft, and capable of relying strictly on reachback C2 capabilities.  (Reachback is a concept more than a computational method of processing information.  It depends almost exclusively on network connectivity to the GIG.  Without connectivity, the user is severely hampered and may have limited or no organic processing capability.  With connectivity, the user will initiate powerful C2 functionality.  For example, e-mail servers are accessed remotely using wireless technology without organic Rapid Response Kit e-mail servers.  Functional processing will be initiated on servers thousand of miles from the area of operations.  Computers can be secure, “thin” (objective: wireless) clients and still accomplish the mission by leveraging the processing power of C2 severs elsewhere on the GIG.) 1.1  STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO) The overall objective of this BAA is to design and build a prototype Rapid Response Kit that can be standalone and can operate with the current Increment I system.  The Rapid Response Kit must meet performance requirements stated in Section 2, and illustrate a migration path to the DoD Net Centric and GIG-ES architectures. The Rapid Response Kit will use reachback with a light system capable of being transported by one or two persons on commercial and military aircraft.   The effort comprises three Phases.  Phase I will provide a preliminary system design for the Rapid Response Kit.  Phase II will generate a final design package.  Phase III will be the prototype development and demonstration of accepted Phase II design(s) with a Technology Risk Reduction system to validate the design and capabilities.   A Government objective is to be able to include validated designs resulting from this BAA in the planned Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Increment II post-Milestone B System Development and Demonstration Phase for offeror evaluation and potential inclusion in their proposed approach.   Therefore, all proposals must provide the information required by DFARS Clause 252.227-7017 ”Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions (Jun 1995)” as part of any proposal submitted under this BAA.   1.1.1  Phase I Task Area Objectives Task: Rapid Response Kit (RRK) Preliminary Design.  Create a preliminary design that meets the requirements stated in Section 2 for an RRK that will provide a highly mobile C2 capability to first responders and small control teams. The contractor will deliver preliminary design documentation and make an oral presentation to the Government within 30 days of Phase I award.  This effort will produce general drawings and associated analysis and trade studies that can best convey the merits of the design approach. 1.1.2  Phase II Task Area Objectives (Option) Task: Rapid Response Kit Final Design.  Building on efforts from Phase I, generate a final RRK design that meets or exceeds the Government’s stated performance objectives identified in Section 2.  The Contractor shall deliver to the Government the final detailed design documentation and make an oral presentation within 60 days of receipt of Phase II notice to proceed.  This task will produce detailed drawings, analysis, and trade studies that will enable the contractor to build and integrate the RRK capability into an existing Increment I DJC2 system. 1.1.3 Phase III Task Area Objectives (Option) Task: Rapid Response Kit Prototyping Development and Demonstration.  Conduct system prototyping to evaluate how the Rapid Response Kit capabilities from Phase II will perform in an actual operating environment.  Prototype designs should facilitate rapid incorporation into the Increment I system baseline.  The Contractor shall develop and delivers to the Government an Engineering Design Package (information, drawings, mock-ups, prototypes, software, test results, hardware, expertise, and facilities) to serve as supporting information and knowledge for Increment II design and development within 120 days of Phase III contract award. The Contractor shall also plan and execute an Information Assurance (IA) vulnerability assessment of Everything Over Internet Protocol (EoIP) functionality by an independent (Government or Industry) IA assessment organization.  The Contractor shall deliver the assessment to the Government within 120 days of the start of Phase III. 1.2 MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES The DJC2 Program Office objective is to gain knowledge on available technologies that will allow key Increment II capabilities to be evaluated prior to Milestone B.  This knowledge is critical to assessing the technical difficulties of Increment II capabilities prior to entering the System Design and Demonstration Phase of the Increment II Program. The Joint Program Office desires to investigate multiple concepts and design approaches and advance the most promising designs to a demonstration of capability with a prototype RRK.  The JPO will evaluate all responses and select multiple contractors to begin concepts and designs for  Phase I.  Preliminary designs will be evaluated to select contractor(s) to advance to Phase II for final design efforts.  Final designs will be evaluated to select one or more contractors to advance to Phase III for prototype development and demonstration.  Determination of the number of awards for each phase will be based on the soundness of the technology solution offered, technical data restrictions, cost, and schedule considerations. 1.3 PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING This BAA is composed of three consecutive phases; each of the phases shall be separately priced in order that the Government can rapidly advance acceptable designs. The first phase of this BAA solicits proposals for a 1-month effort that focuses on advanced technology, concept development, and preliminary design work.  Phase II calls for a 2-month effort to develop a detailed design and generate a final design package.  Phase III is expected to be a 4-month effort to build, integrate, test, and evaluate a prototype RRK.  Phase I:  Phase I will focus on concept and preliminary design development for a DJC2 Rapid Response Kit.  At the completion of this phase, the offerors will present their preliminary design effort to the DJC2 Joint Program Office for evaluation.  The best value designs that achieve the objectives of Phase I will be considered for advancement and award to conduct Phase II final design efforts.  The JPO will select the design(s) that demonstrate the most advantageous technical approach within acceptable cost and schedule constraints to proceed to Phase II, and will notify contractors within 10 working days of the last Phase I presentation. In Phase I, the Joint Program Office expects to award up to six contracts.  Each project team should include an appropriate mix of expertise in order to develop an end-to-end, integrated technical solution.  Projects that address only one or a subset of technical challenges within the task area are not likely to be selected. Phase II:  Concepts and Designs from Phase I will be evaluated and up to three preliminary designs that provide the best capability within the stated criteria will be selected to advance to Phase II to complete the detailed design and generate a design packet. Contractors’ designs that are determined to be technically sound, offer a good technical risk/cost trade-off approach, and meet or exceed the objectives of Phase II will be considered for advancement and award to conduct Phase III prototype development and demonstration efforts.  The Joint Program Office will select the design(s) that demonstrate the most advantageous technical approach within acceptable cost and schedule constraints to proceed to Phase III, and will notify contractors within 10 days of the last Phase II presentation. Phase III:  The contractors that are selected for Phase III will develop and integrate their design and validate the new capability through demonstration with Increment I DJC2 equipment.  Phase III contractors will be selected from the Phase II contractors based upon considerations of design maturity, evaluated product performance risk, schedule and cost.   The Government reserves the right to adjust the total program funding and the number of awards for all three phases to meet the best interests of the program. 2.  TECHNICAL APPROACH The proposal should include a schedule for each of the three phases and each proposal should describe a comprehensive technical approach that addresses the following task areas: PHASE I TASK:  Rapid Response Kit Preliminary Design The objective of this task is to develop a concept and preliminary design for a Rapid Response Kit that meets or exceeds the Government’s requirements within the following technical parameters: ·	Provide capability to connect to two (2) GIG-accessible, crypto-covered networks at once (e.g., NIPRNet, SIPRNet, CENTRIXS) ·	Provide secure wireless (objective) to clients ·	Utilize Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP) ·	All equipment must meet commercial airline standards for carry-on luggage for commercial aircraft (Objective:  Transport by two persons) ·	Provide Net Centric operations to the maximum extent possible ·	Demonstrate multi-mode (data, video, and voice) operations ·	Provide minimum of 4 Voice Over IP (VoIP) telephonic instruments ·	Must be able to use thin or thick clients, and must support 5 clients (threshold)/15 clients (objective) ·	Provide radio with 1.024 Mbps threshold, 4.196 Mbps objective per network ·	Provide Reliability, Maintainability, Availability, Built-in Test and logistic support as an objective ·	Provide compact, ruggedized, protective packaging It is expected the awardees will use own facilities to accomplish design tasks.  Leveraging existing hardware and software is highly encouraged and commercially available open system communication resources should be selected where possible.  Selection rationale for technologies, including critical specifications and estimated costs, should be presented in detail in the proposal.  Specific quantitative metrics and goals relevant to DJC2 must be established and a migration path to Net Centric and GIG-ES Architectures clearly evident.  Hence the proposal should provide descriptions of technical claims and detailed testing procedures and tools for evaluating the utility of the technology system in enhancing DJC2 operational effectiveness. Concepts for measuring operational effectiveness should be developed in the proposal. PHASE II TASK:  Rapid Response Kit Final Design The objective of this task is to generate a detailed final design package for an RRK that meets or exceeds the requirements previously stated for Phase I.  The schedule and other management controls identified in Section 1 are applicable. PHASE III TASK:  Rapid Response Kit Prototype Development and Demonstration The designs from Phase II will be down-selected for prototype development for Phase III.   The RRK design will demonstrate functional capability by operating with the existing Developmental Test Unit (DTU).  The DTU and the RRK will be set up at a selected test facility on the Naval Support Activity Panama City (NSA-PC) complex. The test facility will provide the necessary power, heating/cooling, shelters, and security required for the demonstration. A limited performance test event (approximately 3 – 5 days) will be executed as part of the RRK functional demonstration. The testing will comprise a selected set of test cards from the DT-CII (B) event.  A minimum set of military and civilian operators/testers will be provided to evaluate the RRK’s function capability.  The offeror must quantify the capability to be realized through their proposed concepts and technology. The Joint Program Office will arrange for general material storage, as well as any required special material (Classified) storage during the demonstration event period. Current Increment I resources available to all awardees will be: the Increment I design, the specification, the Capabilities Production Document, agreed upon visits to the Joint Program Office, and an opportunity to observe a DJC2 Increment I System set up at NSA-PC. 3.

2005 Innovations in Geospatial Intelligence 
Broad Agency Announcement #HM1582-05-BAA-0004

INTRODUCTION
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicits offers for the award of procurement contracts for innovative, high-risk, non-traditional Geospatial Intelligence concepts, technologies and products with a potential for high-payoff.  These contracts are hereafter described as the  “Innovation Program.”  
This BAA is being publicized at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.nga.mil (click on Business Opportunities).
GENERAL INFORMATION
The NGA expects to award up to $1 million in procurement contracts for innovative, cutting edge Geospatial Intelligence concepts, technologies and products.  It is anticipated that there will be one contract awarded for $1,000,000.   Based on the quality of proposals, there is a potential for awarding two contracts for $500,000 each. It is important for researchers to find opportunities for collaboration to address all aspects of this proposal.  Awards made under this BAA are Subject to the Availability of Funds.
The Government reserves the right to award all, some or none of the proposals received.  All responsible U. S. sources capable of satisfying the Government’s needs may submit a proposal for consideration by NGA.   Awards made under this BAA will comply with export control laws related to export of and foreign access to U.S. Government-funded technology development.    
Note:  Only procurement contracts will be awarded as a result of this BAA.  Grants, cooperative agreements, and/or any other forms of federal assistance will not be awarded.
INNOVATION PROGRAM AND OBJECTIVES
The Innovation Program is seeking innovative approaches to improve automated filtering of data for our analysts to help mitigate challenges associated with information volume, variety and velocity.  Awardees will be expected to deliver Proof of Concept demonstrations, containing only unclassified data that can be installed from CD in a generic Windows environment. 
TECHNICAL INTEREST AREA
Intelligent Triage of Geospatially Referenced Information
The Innovation BAA is requesting innovative research that will focus on enabling the processing, analysis and dissemination of enormous amounts of newly collected data each day from multiple sources.  Enormous amounts of data may come from numerous sources and in several formats – text, image, video, digital maps, audio, etc. To help analysts make efficient use of their time, NGA needs automated processes that can identify and organize contextually relevant types of data. The overall intent is to allow analysts to spend less time dealing with systems and more time analyzing data.  
Research proposals should address automated triage of information and data combined with an intuitive human-computer interface to facilitate the analysis process.   To ensure a seamless integration between data triage functionality and the user interface, NGA highly encourages collaboration between researchers addressing each area.
Scenario of Application:  Simulated problem of national security concern (e.g., weapons of mass destruction proliferation, catastrophic chemical disaster, terrorist activities, etc.) that uses and contributes to a geospatially-referenced knowledge base.  The scenario could be fictitious and must deal with a problem that would require enormous amounts of differing types of source data.  The multi-source, multi-format input data should be voluminous enough to demonstrate the usefulness of the functionality and be based on a geo-referenced system as the foundation.    Researchers should be prepared to supply their own data  -- geospatial and otherwise.
Functionality: Automated dynamic filtering of multi-source information for the analyst using an intuitive user interface.  The capability needs to deliver diverse data types that are relevant to the problem, displayed in easily understood way, and employ a geo-referenced / geo-location based system as the foundation for multi source application analysis.
Automated Dynamic Filtering:  Not all of the information collected could or should be distributed to the user or analyst.  Intelligent information switches are needed that can respond to situational cues in order to route contextually relevant information (data) to analysts for review while maintaining the indexed flow of information to archival storage.  Data filters should automatically react to potential threats or changes and distribute information in real time based on inferences made about the relevance of the data in the current context.  Most or all information from a specific area of interest will be diverted to archival storage.  As the automated inferences indicate a need for analysts to be more attentive to a given data stream, that stream could be directed to an analyst along with an alert to the potential event requiring human attention.  When events are validated by the analyst, some of the archived data will need to be retrieved and presented.  These filters need to be able to tune themselves in response to their assessed utility to an analyst.  Potentially relevant information must be made available to the analyst without disrupting or unduly distracting from the actual process of analysis.  In this triaged information scenario, new analytical environments and tools will be needed.  
User Interface: As information flow increases, there is an increasing need for analysts to display complex, multi-INT information as part of an integrated information environment designed to match the way users perceive, process and use data.   The interface needs to enable analysts to rapidly perceive and understand evolving patterns embedded in massive, complex, high dimensional datasets.
Information displays should contain the following capabilities:
·	Multi-sensory and collaborative, allowing both individuals and teams to work with data using all of its spatial and temporal aspects simultaneously.  
·	Combine advanced information modeling and management functionality with a visualization-oriented user interface.   
·	Have the capability to drill down through multiple paths simultaneously and graphically depict relationships among data by displaying them in a variety of formats.  
·	Support web based services utilizing GIS tools to host and serve a variety of geospatial data.  
Performance: The proposals should include a plan for assessing the effectiveness of the technology.  The metrics should show how their technology is helping the analyst manage their workload.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

Solicitation number 2005-N-02094 is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  RFP 2005-N-02094 and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.  This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The associated NAICS code 541511 and the small business size standard is annual receipts of no more than $21,000,000.00.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Office of Research Methodology (ORM), Questionnaire Design Research Laboratory (QDRL), has identified the lack of a place to house the findings of cognitive testing conducted by researchers as the greatest impediment to the expansion of the knowledge base and the advancement of methodologies within the field of response error and cognitive evaluation.

It is the Government’s intention, to develop and field a web-based information system that will provide participating agencies with a meta-database in which to house cognitively tested survey questions with linkage to corresponding test findings; and online access to pre-test findings of other agencies involved in such research / design.  The database will be searchable by (1) content or subject matter, (2) question type, (3) response category type, and (4) response error type.  A parallel tool has been developed that will perform basic statistical analysis on questions housed in the database.  

The professional services required by this combined synposis /solicitation are a continuation of a three-year effort to develop, implement, and maintain such a database.  This project will require access to proprietary source code, an understanding of ORM requirements and goal, and intricate knowledge of:  survey analysis terminology, methodology and operating procedures employed by ORM; NCHS Application Certification process, Virage Video Software – digitizing activities and procedures, QDR laboratory operations, and ORM data tagging concepts.

<DESC>Amendment No. 2 - Following are questions and answers for informational purposes:
1. Q:  What was the cost per KM from past awards? 
A:  Last years contract for imagery, interpretation, and mapping amounted to about $80.00 per kilometer of shoreline.  
2. Q:  Provide a more detailed description of what kind and how much ground verification and sampling they are requiring.
A:  Most of the ground verification is based on the previous experience of the geomorphologist and biologists trained in ShoreZone interpretation who have mapped other areas in Alaska and British Columbia.  Some verification is done during the imagery when or if there is any question about a particular segment of shoreline.
3. Q:  Would stream temperature surveys with a camera system be helpful information?
A:  At this time, we are not particularly interested in temperature as we are concentrating on the physical and biological components of the shoreline habitat.
4.  Q:  What kind of samples are wanted?
A:  No samples are required but technical observations and interpretations from the still and video digital images collected from the helicopter flights.  These observations and interpretations are based on professional expertise developed from previously collected samples and field verification.
5.  Q:  Will agency personal be on flights, to take samples, or observe?   
A:  Agency personnel will be on the flights to take digital still photos and to make and record biological observations of the biobands for each Shorezone unit inventoried.  NMFS will have at least one biologist on all flights and perhaps two, depending on available seats.

6.  Q:  Who posts the web video images and how many?
A:  A new website does not need to be developed, however, for the contractor will need to provide 1 second jpg’s of the video as well as high resolution jpg’s of the still photos.  The contractor must also provide shape files of the flightlines and the bioband data.  The shape file attributes must include a 6 digit number from the video frames to ensure that the correct flightline point is associated with the right jpg.  There also needs to be some device attached to the camera so that the orientation of the video is known.
7.  Q:  Where can we see what was provided in the past? 
A:  The incumbent contractor, Coastal and Ocean Resources Inc.  The website is http://coastalalaska.net
