<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to award a one year (base) contract with one option year with the Joint Commission International (JCI). This is a follow-on contract to provide support of the activities necessary to maintain the final standard operating protocols (SOPs) for the High 5s Project; and support the AHRQ's role as the United States Lead Technical Agency (US LTA) and protocol lead.<br />This acquisition will require the contractor to perform the following tasks: (1) collaborating centre activities; (2) maintain the standard operating protocols (SOPs) and toolkits; (3) maintain the information management system, evaluation plan and data collection; and (4) provide United States Lead Technical Agency (US LTA) support.<br />This sole source follow-on is based on the unique capabilities and qualifications of the JCI. These unique capabilities include a designation by the World Health Organization (WHO), in August 2005, as the world's first and only WHO Collaborating Centre dedicated solely to patient safety. The JCI works collaboratively with ministries of health, national patient safety organizations and experts, health care professional organizations, and patient/consumer groups on Patient Safety Solutions, Patient Safety Practices and other issues related to reducing safety risks to patients. JCI has coordinated and managed this project since August 2008.<br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to continue with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

This synopsis precedes the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) entitled, "Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC)" for construction and design/build services.  The subsequent contracts will be performed for the Department of Veterans Affairs, James E. Van Zandt, Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC), Altoona, Pennsylvania.    As a result of the solicitation, the Government intends that a minimum of eight (8) indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts will be awarded providing sufficient qualified contractors present acceptable offers. This is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside.   Contractors must be registered in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Biz Database to be eligible to submit a proposal.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/. Contractors must be verified as a SDVOSB to be eligible for award.  Contractor must be registered in Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov to be eligible for award.  Additionally, contractors must be registered with Vets 100 at http://vets.dol.gov/vets100/ and complete their online Representations and Certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The applicable NAICS code is 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million in average annual receipts.   Awards will be made to offerors whose proposals are responsive and conforming to the RFP, and are also determined to be most advantageous to the Government in terms of Technical, Past Performance, and Price. Work to be performed under the MATOC contract(s) will include construction and design/build projects.  Typical work includes, but is not limited to: interior and exterior renovations and alterations, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC controls, fire suppression, and intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt, paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, construction of new facilities, demolition, surveys, design/build and other related work.  Projects will principally be design/bid/build type from already completed designs, or projects specified by a statement of work using the VA Master Specifications.  However, offerings may include some design/build projects.  Award of the design/build option may be restricted to companies having demonstrated past performance and technical capability for performing design/build projects. Contractors can qualify for a base contract without submitting a proposal for design/build.  The resulting contracts will not have fixed unit costs.  All contract work will be completed through individual task orders awarded for individual projects at the James E. Van Zandt VAMC.  Each task order will be priced individually and will include its own wage determination.  These task orders will be competed amongst the IDIQ awardees only.  Each of the resulting contracts will include a one (1) year base period and four (4), one (1) year option periods. The minimum and maximum values for a single Task Order are $2,000 and $5 Million, respectively. The maximum value of each contract will not exceed $30 million over the life of the contract. The minimum guaranteed order for each contract is one (1) task order valued at a minimum of $5,000 or if no task order project is awarded a guaranteed fee of $5,000 will be paid to the contractor. The minimum fee will only be paid if the awarded contractor continues to compete for, but is not awarded, a task order throughout the life of the contract. If a contractor is not awarded all option years as a result of a contractor failing to submit proposals or as a result of poor past performance on previous task orders, the contractor will not be entitled to the minimum guarantee.   The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award construction contracts within the activities covered by the proposed MATOC contracts to contractors other than those awarded a contract under this solicitation. This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  The anticipated release date for the Solicitation is April 10, 2012.  The solicitation will be posted at this website, www.fbo.gov. All inquiries shall be in writing, e-mail inquiries to Mr. Michael Koontz at michael.koontz2@va.gov.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of cabling in two ISAF buildings at Kabul Airport.
<p>NC3A has been authorized to use the Alliance Operations and Missions (AOM) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. The contract will be awarded on a lowest price technically compliant basis.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13470-AMN. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>The technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO Unclassified. For the performance of the contract, however, contractor personnel will be required to hold a NATO SECRET security clearance and be required to deploy to ISAF. Prospective bidders are cautioned that the contact award and contract performance will not be delayed in order to allow contractor personnel to obtain clearances. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>For the Summary of Requirements, please see the NC3A bulletin board:</p>
<p>https://industry.nc3a.nato.int/suppliers/Pages/bb.aspx</p>
<p>Please note: The NC3A bulletin board announcement includes a list of firms holding NC3A Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) that have been screened as having the appropriate skills and disciplines for the work envisaged under the prospective contract. Any other firm holding a current NC3A BOA that wishes to receive a copy of this solicitation may request to be added to the bidders list by contacting the NC3A official specified in the announcement.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list those firms that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request a DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application) no later than 02 April 2012</p>
<p>- IFB planned to be issued April 2012</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for May 2012</p>
<p>- Contract Award expected to take place in May 2012</p>

<a href="mailto:dlavergne@blm.gov">dlavergne@blm.gov</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for the feed and care of, adoption of, training of and transportation of up to 200 wild horses/burros.  The contractor must provide all necessary labor, materials and facilities to:  Feed and care for up to 200 wild horses and burros on pasture and/or corral - Handle, sort, load, unload, and provide necessary veterinary and farrier care to the animals - Train the animals using non-restraint methods; and - Conduct training clinics and seminars to persons who have been approved by the BLM to adopt wild horses or burros.   Requirements: The contractor shall maintain a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 200 animals at his/her facility, WHICH MUST BE LOCATED IN THE STATES OF EITHER WYOMING OR NEBRASKA and WITHIN A 150-MILE RADIUS OF CHEYENNE, WYOMING.  Up to 10 of these animals may be burros (jacks or jennies).  All horses will be mares or geldings between the ages of six (6) months old and five (5) years old, unless both parties agree (on a case by case basis) to accept a mare or gelding over the age of five (5).  No more than one half (1/2) of the horses held at the facility, at any one time, will be under the age of two (2) years.  BLM will minimize as much as possible the number of pregnant mares sent to the contractor.  The contractor will inspect the animals when first delivered.  He/she will then advise the BLM COR or PI of any animals that have physical defects that may make the animal unadoptable.  The BLM COR or PI will then determine, with a veterinarians recommendation when necessary, if the animal should be placed at another holding facility where training is not available.  The contractor shall gather all animals on pasture at BLMs request.  A one-week notice shall be given for gathering. The contractor shall provide for adoption as many of the animals maintained at his/her facility as possible each year.  The contractor may gentle or train the animals to any level necessary to get them adopted and may adopt untrained animals.  All potential adoptions at the contractors facility will be by scheduled appointment, scheduled BLM satellite adoption event (locally or out of state), or via the internet adoption system.   Any qualified adopters that select animals at the contractors facility will have to provide applications, signed PMACAs, and payment to the Wyoming State Office.  Animals adopted at BLM satellite adoptions will be adopted in the same manner as untrained animals offered there.  The contractor may conduct training clinics at his/her facility for qualified adopters.The contractor will be requested to transport animals to adoption sites specified by the Government and demonstrate the amount of training each animal has received.  If specifically requested by the BLM COR or PI, the contractor may transport adopted animals up to 300 miles from the contractors facility to another BLM adoption facility or to an adopters facility.  The contractor may be requested to pick up and transport previously adopted animals that have been relinquished or repossessed by the BLM.  If specifically requested by the BLM COR or PI, the contractor may transport these animals up to 400 miles from the contractors facility to another BLM adoption facility or back to the contractors facility.  As the number of animals at the contractors facility decline, the COR and/or PI will make arrangements for BLM to bring replacement animals, delivered by either semi-truck or horse trailer.  Delivery by horse trailer will depend on the availability of animals within a one day driving radius. The Contractor shall be paid to attend satellite adoption events and/or provide gentling and training demonstrations as requested and approved in advance by the BLM.  The contractor shall receive a daily fee which will cover reimbursement of all associated travel related expenses and labor for him/herself and up to two assistants. All training will be conducted using least resistance techniques.  Except for those animals in training, animals will be maintained on pasture.  Animals on pasture shall have free access to water and those in training shall have daily access to water.   Supplemental feed including hay and protein supplement will be fed as necessary to maintain the animals in an acceptable body condition (Henneke condition score of 4).  The BLM will make every effort to deliver animals to the contractors facility that fit this body condition in order to prevent the contractor from incurring unneeded expenses to get the animal to the desired body condition.  If an animal cannot maintain that condition, the contractor shall isolate the animal in a separate sick pen and provide special attention including nutritional and or veterinary care.  Hay must be good quality, non-moldy, non-dusty grass, alfalfa, or a mix. All animals shall be maintained, treated, and handled in a humane manner and in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations. The animals hooves shall be trimmed as needed to maintain the proper shape and length of the feet. FACILITIES -Except for a portable tip chute (which will be provided by BLM for the purpose of providing veterinary care and farrier care) the contractor will provide all necessary facilities.  The training facility shall have pens and runways to use for the movement of animals.  All pens and runways shall be 6 feet high and of sufficient strength to hold wild horses.  Acceptable materials in order of BLMs preference are: Pipe, wood, and/or mesh wire with openings smaller than 2 X 4 inches.  Mesh wire with larger openings must be covered with plastic snow fence. Corrals constructed of mesh wire must be covered with plastic snow fence or equipped with sight boards (2 X 6 inch lumber).  The sight board shall be located at the upper and middle portion of the corral fence.  Corrals that are constructed of pipe or wood must have proper spacing between members (no more than 12 inches). A minimum space of 144 square feet of corral space shall be provided for each animal that is in training and exercised each day in accordance with 43 CFR 4750.3-2(3)(I).  The training facility shall provide separate corrals for each animal being trained with some type of wind break or shield appropriate for the area.  The contractor must provide an indoor facility for training horses and conducting training clinics during the winter and inclement weather.  This facility should be at least 10000 square feet in size. The training facility must be clean and the animal waste removed at least once per month.  The facility must be designed and built to comply with all applicable Federal and State regulations relating to livestock waste control and off-site pollution.  The entire facility must have sufficient drainage to eliminate any standing water and/or muddy conditions in the areas where the animals are being held. Pasture fencing may be of common fencing materials but must be of sufficient height and condition to prevent the escape of these wild horses.  The contractor is responsible for the recapture of any animals that may escape.  Forage condition in the pastures must be sufficient enough so that the animals are content and do not pressure the fences. Pastures must have natural or manmade shelter.  Animals on pasture shall have free access to water at all times. Delivery by horse trailer will depend on the availability of animals within a one day driving radius.  This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation L12PS00318, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about April 15, 2012. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award. Contracting Officer, Danny Lavergne, dlavergne@blm.gov

<DESC>F.C.I. Big Spring would like to lease an ORCA Green Machine Model OG-1200 organic waste disposal system or Eco-Safe Digester 1200. The lease would be a year lease with an additional option year if F.C.I. Big Spring decides to exercise the option year. If F.C.I. Big Spring decides not to exercise the option year, the digester machine would be returned to the company with no additional cost for F.C.I. Big Spring. The only fees that will be paid will be the fees for the actual time that F.C.I. Big Spring utilized the digester machine. <br /><br />The ORCA Green Machine Model OG-1200 organic waste disposal system utilizes micro-biological technology to dispose of as much as 1200 lbs. /day of food waste per day. The resulting by-product is a nutrient rich "compost tea" that can be safely released into the sanitary sewer system.
<p>The Eco-Safe Digester will safely and quickly decompose virtually all organic food waste including: meat, poultry, fish, fruit, vegetables, rice, pasta, bread, coffee grinds, eggshells, and dairy products. A highly refined formula of microorganisms is used to breakdown organic waste into a liquid which can be safely disposed down the drain, completely eliminating the waste, and ultimately allowing the effluent to return to our ecosystem as water.</p>

<RESPDATE>051412
<CONTACT>Diane J Meeder, Phone (412)386-4412, Email DMeeder@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ambulance Patient Compartment Testing.<br /></strong></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I. Background</strong></span>
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the National Truck Equipment Association's Ambulance Manufacturers Division (AMD), is engaged in an effort to improve worker safety in the patient compartment of U.S. based ambulances. This collaborative work builds on completed research performed by NIOSH under past NIOSH funded projects. The first outcome from this joint effort was the development of AMD Standard 025, "Measuring Guidelines: Occupant Head Clearance Zones". Additional interim outcomes include the publishing of SAE J2917 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (2010)" and SAE J2956 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (2011)". These two SAE Recommended Practices document the response measured in an ambulance patient compartment during front and side full vehicle crash testing, respectively. SAE J2917 and J2956 are now being used as input loading for continuing work targeting improvements in seating, cot, and equipment mount design. It should be noted that while crash testing a vehicle in a 30 mph frontal impact, as was done during the development of the SAE J2917, is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs. (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>With work on seating, cots, and equipment mounts underway, NIOSH and the AMD are now prepared to expand their work to include improvements to the structural integrity of the patient compartment. In an effort to move forward, the AMD established a sub-committee charged with developing a series of tests designed to better understand the loading applied to the patient compartment structure during a frontal impact (front corner of the patient compartment box) and a rollover event. The hope is to then translate these measured "dynamic" loading events into a repeatable static test for the industry's use.</p>
<p>Under this contracting effort, the Contractor shall utilize the testing methodologies proposed by the AMD Body Integrity Subcommittee (attached), to conduct dynamic and static testing of the patient compartments of several ambulances. Testing shall be conducted to accomplish several tasks: (1) validate the testing methods proposed in each dynamic test, (2) to acquire the loading experienced by the patient compartment structure during each dynamic test, and (3) to validate the methods proposed in the static test to fully exercise the patient compartment's structural integrity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract</strong></span></p>
<p>This contract shall quantify the dynamic loading experienced by the patient compartment of a commercial ambulance through the use of four different testing methods. These test methods are draft documents proposed by an industry-government team of experts and borrow heavily from testing of civilian and commercial vehicles. As a part of this process, the testing methods themselves shall be evaluated and validated. At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a dataset which will:</p>
<p>1. Qualify the logic and language described in each of the four proposed test methods.</p>
<p>2. Provide the data necessary for AMD and its partners to approve one to four of the proposed test methods as a new standard or standards to validate improvements in the structural integrity of patient compartment of the ambulance.</p>
<p>3. If funded as options to the effort, the pulse shapes described in SAE J2917 and SAE J2956 will be validated for use in the design of interiors for Type II (raised roof vans and Sprinters).</p>
<p>The Contractor will be expected to work to a fairly aggressive schedule as this data will be evaluated for possible inclusion in the second edition of the new National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 1917 Automotive Ambulance Standard. This is the first national consensus standard which has gained the support of most factions associated with the industry: manufacturers, end users, suppliers, and government purchasers. The first edition is expected to be published in June 2012. A comment period of 12 months will follow leading to the development of the 2nd edition. Given the goal of this research is to influence the 2nd Edition; we anticipate a need to be finished prior to June 2013.</p>
<p><strong>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The CDC expects a single firm fixed price with a period of performance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nine (9) months.</span></strong></p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about <strong>April 11, 2012</strong> and proposals will be due on or about <strong>May 14, 2012</strong>, No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about April 13, 2012. It is determined that these services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.101. The Department intends to issue a full and open competitive&nbsp;solicitation to obtain services to assist in the Office of Vocational and Adult Education's (OVAE) need for a better understanding of the various available Open Education Resources (OERs) to support STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) teaching and learning.&nbsp; A 36 month firm fixed price contract is planned.
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>The American economy is expanding in the areas of STEM jobs. The importance of STEM education is not just for advanced engineering; STEM competencies are required throughout the modern workplace and indeed modern life. The Department plans to accelerate the teaching and learning of STEM content in adult education. It is the Department's conviction that adult learners can and should acquire higher levels of science, technology, and mathematics literacies in order to succeed in further education, training, and employment. The Department is committed to utilizing technology in creative and productive ways for teaching and learning. One promising technology development is the incorporation of OERs into classroom teaching. OERs have the potential to deliver high-quality, engaging, and rigorous STEM learning content to every adult education classroom. Even though OERs are freely available on the web, challenges to realizing their potential in adult education programs include an uneven technology infrastructure, an underprepared teaching workforce, lack of awareness of the opportunities of OERs by administrators and instructional leaders, and a lack of aligned curricula and formative assessment techniques in these subject areas. This procurement will assist OVAE by investigating several of these challenges and identifying solutions.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective:</p>
<p>This effort&nbsp;seeks to advance OVAE's understanding of these emerging technologies and instructional models, and build capacity in the adult education field to utilize OERs for science and math instruction. Through this procurement, the contractor shall involve nationally recognized subject matter experts, establish evaluation criteria that identify promising OERs, recruit and support practitioner user groups, disseminate information and stimulate demand for knowledge about STEM resources, create and deliver professional development materials, and investigate emerging models to make recommendations to the Department.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6079, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Metabolon Inc of 617 Davis Drive Suite 400 Morrisville, NC 27560 to provide Metabolomic analysis assays.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $13.5 Million. <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.<br /><br />Esophageal cancer consists of two main histological types: esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Although both diseases arise from the same organ, differences in incidence trends and risk factors indicate that they are etiologically distinct. The reasons for such a large variation in risk factors and disease incidence by histological type remain unclear. This suggests a need to identify biomarkers that may serve as a link to understanding the mechanisms through which established risk factors affect risk of EAC and ESCC. Recently, advances in the development of metabolite profiling technologies, or metabolomics, have emerged as a way to comprehensively study metabolism, metabolites and other small molecules in tissues and body fluids. The potential utility of metabolomics to cancer research has resulted in several studies of various malignancies. <br /><br />Although metabolomics holds much promise as a biomarker discovery method, a practical obstruction to its widespread adoption is that metabolomics labs typically provide only raw mass-spectrometry data rather translate the data into metabolites and metabolite concentrations. In practice, knowing that a mass spectrometry &lsquo;peak' is elevated in response to a specific exposure, such as dietary components, is of little use to clinicians, and public health researchers. Specialized knowledge is required to render such information meaningful. In contrast, knowing that a specific metabolite responds to a specific exposure is of potentially great utility and general applicability.<br /><br />Metabolon Inc. provides broad linkage of MS peaks to actual metabolite identities across the metabolome (400+ metabolite identities). Metabolon Inc. utilizes specific informatics methods used to link mass-spectrometry output to actual metabolite identities. Furthermore, the DCCPS study will be conducted in concert with a number of other ongoing metabolomics projects that are slated to be done at Metabolon Inc. In order for study results to be comparable with those of the other projects and allow for pooling of the results from control subjects across these studies, the same laboratory must perform the analyses. For the aforementioned reasons, Metabolon Inc. is the only known lab that NCI can use to achieve its primary study aims.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on April 09, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax); an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Miguel Diaz, Contract Specialist at miguel.diaz@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-120049-MD on all correspondences.

<DESC>Contract HHSN271200723721C, "NINDS Center for Clinical Trial Research Data Management, Methodology, Statistical Design, and Quality Control", with KAI Research Inc. is currently due to expire on May 14, 2012 and will need to be extended for 4.5 months on a sole-source basis in order to allow for continuity/provision of ongoing services pending the outcome of the Institute's small business set-aside re-competition of this requirement (see FedBizOpps Pre-Soliciation Announcement for RFP-NIH-NINDS-12-01, "NINDS Center for Clinical Trial Resources"). The NINDS anticipates a new 5-year term contract for this requirement to be awarded on or about September 30, 2012.
<p>The current contract, HHSN271200723721C,&nbsp;awarded on May 15, 2008 for a five year term, provides ongoing&nbsp;services in support of NINDS sponsored clinical trials in the areas of quality assurance/quality control monitoring services, clinical project tracking and maintenance of the classification system, statistical and methodological support, clinical data acquisition and archiving, data quality control monitoring of the Specialized Program of Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRAIS) program, and common data element development support.</p>
<p>If the current contract were not to be extended for the 4.5 month period pending the outcome of the re-competition, the NINDS would lose critical quality control support of its sponsored clinical trials/studies, endure major disruption and unacceptable delays to current and ongoing common data element development and implementation, lose access to ongoing methodological and statistical support and encounter serious delays in the distribution of archived data sets to the research community. <br /><br /><br />Extension of the current contract for 4.5 months on a sole-source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(1), is deemed necessary in order to avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would likely result from pursuing this 4.5 month requirement on a competitive basis. The current contractor is the only source capable of maintaining services for this brief time period without substantial delays, and the duplication in costs for a different contractor to prepare to take over these services for 4.5 months could not reasonably be expected to be recovered by any potential cost savings to be had from competition.<br /><br />This 4.5 month extension is being pursued on a sole source basis in order to serve a continuing need pending the outcome of the re-competition of this requirement being pursued under Request for Proposals (RFP) RFP-NIH-NINDS-12-01, "NINDS Center for Clinical Trial Resources", open to all qualified small business sources. A new five-year term contract for this requirement, pursued on a competitive basis per the terms of the&nbsp;aforementioned RFP, will follow this 4.5 month sole-source&nbsp; extension of the currently existing contract.&nbsp;<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.&nbsp; The determination by the Government not to compete this 4.5 month extension to the current contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Authority: 41 U.S.C.(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.&nbsp; This is not a formal solicitation or an announcement that a Request for Proposals for this 4.5 month extension is available.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to the New York University School of Medicine (New York University Sleep Institute), 550 First Avenue, New York, NY  10016 for the analyses of modified polysomnograms obtained from NIMH's cohort of children with autism.  The New York University Sleep Institute will (1) examine polysomnography for sleep stages I-IV (N1-N3), REM percentage as a fraction of total sleep time, and latencies to particular stages, sleep efficiency and other parameters of the sleep/wake cycle, (2) use standard GRASS telefactor software to calculate sleep staging and (3) read studies in parallel with Program to achieve rater reliability.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the work is to be conducted at the New York University Sleep Institute, which is well equipped to provide the tools to allow the experts to properly analyze such data.&nbsp; The New York University Sleep Institute has an expert, Dr. Alcibiades Rodriguez, which is fellowship trained in neurology, epilepsy and sleep and is a practicing clinician in sleep disorders.  Correct analyses of sleep data on children with autism and possibly epileptic abnormalities can be quite challenging and is best done by neurologists who have formal sleep and epilepsy training and extensive experience in reading such studies. Dr. Rodriguez works closely with NYU's epilepsy center and he is familiar with the neurophysiology of persons with autism and developmental disabilities.  He has consistently provided NIMH with high quality analyses of their pediatric polysomnograms over the last several years. Dr. Rodriguez is currently in the process of reading the follow-up polysmnographic examinations from NIMH's ongoing, longitudinal study of sleep in three cohorts of young children. These re-reads must be done by the same reader to ensure that there is continuity in testing and consistency in coding across the entire study sample. In addition, analysis of these samples must be done by the appropriate laboratory.&nbsp; Analyses performed via this contract will allow researchers in the Pediatrics &amp; Developmental Neurosciences Branch to accomplish the goals of several clinical research protocols in various stages of development.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months with option(s) for up to four additional one-year periods.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR 12 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 10:00 AM E.T., March 5, 2012 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NNDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2370900 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>FedBiz Synopsis for F404 Kit Procurement
<p><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Contracts Department, Patuxent River, MD in support of NAVAIR 4.4, Propulsion and Power, intends to negotiate a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement FA8122-09-G-0001 on a sole source basis with General Electric, 1000 Western Ave, Lynn, MA 01902 for material and parts (540 Kits) to replace the F404 gray cable with a cable that has a new connector that has a non-decoupling design feature that prevents loosening in service.

General Electric is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only contractor with the requisite knowledge and experience of the current F404 engine required for this effort. The estimated period of performance for this acquisition is 12 months. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they can identify interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Responses must be received by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on 09 April 2012. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is: 336412-Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing.

<DESC>Admiral Clarey Bridge Maintenance and Repair Services, Ford Island, Oahu, Hawaii.  The Ford Island Bridge Facility is comprised of pile supported viaduct structures, hinged 120 and 250 foot composite steel/Portland cement concrete transition spans and a 930 foot long movable concrete pontoon section at the navigation harbor channel.  The bridges concrete components are constructed of Portland cement with a micro-silica fume additive.  The movable pontoon section retracts back under the raised transition spans to provide a clear opening for the passage of ships.  The pontoon extends and locks in place with the lowered transition spans to provide vehicle passage across the bridge.  The retraction and extension operation is accomplished automatically by a programmable logic controller, pre-programmed to sequence the hydraulic operated transition span lift cylinders and winch to control the pontoons movement.
  A microwave communication system transmits control signals to synchronize the hydraulic operated lift cylinders across the bridge open channel.  

This contract will include preventive maintenance (including bridge operation), service calls, and repairs.  The work will include the bridges viaduct, hinged transition spans, movable pontoon, hydraulic systems (which includes the hydraulic controlled machinery and lift cylinders), microwave communications, integrated bridge control system, pontoon leak detection, closed circuit television, roadway traffic signal and control, fire and intrusion detection, bridge electrical systems, catwalks and landings, and other supporting components necessary to maintain the bridges operational and safety standards.
  The repairs will include service and construction work.  The intent of the construction type of repairs is limited to cosmetic and minor structural repairs.  This contract is not intended to perform major construction work.  

The proposed contract type will be a combination firm fixed-price (FFP) and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDID).  IDIQ work will be issued via the DOD EMALL, a web-based ordering system, using Government purchase cards.

<DESC>The U.S. Fleet Cyber Command/U.S. Tenth Fleet, has a requirement for Research and Development (R&D) services for a Surface Electronic Support Capability Augmentation Packages (SECAP) utilizing a modernized High Probability of Intercept (HPI) component that exceeds current SECAP system antenna capabilities.  Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk (FLCN) intends to negotiate using the procedures of FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation, a SOLE SOURCE cost plus fixed fee completion type contract with General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Inc., (GDAIS), at 12450 Fair Lakes Circle, Suite 800, Fairfax, VA 22033-3865.  
The contractor shall perform research and development services to develop a SECAP system prototype with a modernized HPI component.
  These services are required due to current HPI parts obsolescence, to meet operational requirements, and to produce an antenna design that exceeds current SECAP system antenna capabilities.  Since GDAIS developed the SECAP prototype and this requirement is a follow-on to a development effort, it has been determined that awarding to anyone other than GDAIS would cause considerable unacceptable delays and significant duplication of cost.  The authority cited for this sole source acquisition using other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  The period of performance for the resulting contract will be for one (1) twelve-month base period including FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.
  All options will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 17.206(a).
This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  A complete solicitation package will be available on or about 11 April 2012, for download via NECO at http://www.neco.navy.mil or FEDBIZOPPS at http://www.fedbizopps.gov http://www.neco.navy.mil.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712.  Potential contractors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above site; this office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations. By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.
 Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  All questions regarding this requirement should be directed to the POC via e-mail.

SCOPE OF WORK:

Task A: Dental Vacuum System Replacement

All work in this scope is to take place in the basement of Bldg 200.

Before the demolition of the existing system, the contractor shall have a third party Industrial Hygienist to test for any hazardous material. The contractor shall abate accordingly based on those results. If no abatement is required, the contractor shall notify the COR. 

This project shall replace the existing dental vacuum pump system in the basement of Building 200. The contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, and supervision to install a new dental vacuum system which includes but not limited to the installation of a new Amalgam/Mercury Separator, two (2) new separator tanks, two (2) new dental vacuums, and all associated piping, approximately 150 ft , including but not limited to, piping to the exhaust, piping that connects the separator, separator tanks, and the vacuums. The contractor shall install (2) new valves to the existing point of connection that connects to the dental area to allow for shut off capabilities for each pump. The contractor shall install the new system mentioned above per attached specifications and NFPA 99 requirements. The contractor shall size all pumps, separators, holding tanks, and VFDs based on a 14 dental chair demand located on the 1st floor of Building 200 and attached specifications and NFPA 99 requirements. The contractor shall submit all system manufactures and specifications and proposed new schematic to the COR and have it approved before the order and installation.  

The contractor shall install a new control system that allows for 24/7 operation with Toshiba VFD's that allows for engineering and end user to start/stop electronically with monitoring capabilities in BLDG 6 and the dental service area respectively. The pumps shall be controlled such that one pump is the primary, or lead, pump on any given day and the remaining pump or pumps are secondary, or lag, pumps. The lag pump(s) only kick in when demand exceeds the lead pump's capacity. The pumps are automatically cycled such that each day a different pump serves as the lead pump. The system shall also read that if the primary pump at the time fails, the secondary pump will automatically come on line. At a minimum, the contractor shall have experience in installing N2 networks that tie into a Johnson Controls Metasys system.	

The contractor shall replace three Disconnect Switches connected with the Dental Pumps with new 600amp 480v stainless steel Disconnect Switches. The contractor shall size and install the new disconnect switches and associated work according to NEC code and NFPA 99, 70E and attached specifications. The contractor shall run all conduit to and tie-in to EMS-B which is located in the same building. The disconnect switches be fully functions after installation with the new controls system. 

Utility shutdowns for this work will mostly occur on weekends or late at night.  Before any work can begin a clear plan of all electrical work must be submitted to the VA for approval.  This plan should very specific on time lines and give step by step instructions for each piece of work to be completed.  All work, including all hot work must comply with NEC and NFPA 99, 70E.  Utility shutdowns for this project shall be incremented and scheduled ahead of time.  A full submission of all shutdowns for the whole project shall be given 45 days before the first shutdown is to occur.

The contractor is responsible for removing the existing system. Phasing is necessary as the system needs to remain functional throughout the project. The contractor shall back feed the system with the existing feed from Building 205 during this phase of the project.  The contractor shall install service valves that allow for isolation to Building 200 during and after the installation. The contractor shall install all the electrical for the new system.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: USAF Imaging &amp; Targeting Support (AFMC ASC/WIN) Synopsis. ASC/WIN requests information on the following capabilities:<br /><br />&bull; ISR supporting find, fix, track, target assess for RPAs<br />&bull; Detection of CC&amp;D targets<br />&bull; Post Optical Bar Camera (OBC) broad area synoptic coverage<br />&bull; Capability to detect/collect in dense/cluttered terrain and denied access areas<br />&bull; Production of synthetic background clutter<br />&bull; Characterizing "blue" airborne ISR capabilities<br />&bull; Collect specific hyper-spectral ISR (imagery) in anti-access/area-denial<br />&bull; Integrated air and missile (IAMD) - detect, track and ID targets as "blue" vs. "red"<br />&bull; ISR supporting find, fix, track, target, assess theater ballistic missiles<br />&bull; Locate tunnels<br />&bull; Provide surveillance on open seas and littoral approaches to U.S.<br />&bull; Collecting true calibrated RCS values in denied areas<br />&bull; Detect, (characterize) and track dismounts in densely populated areas<br />&bull; Multi-INT collection in triple canopy jungle<br />&bull; Reliable airborne, stand-off data collection against long range threats<br />&bull; Detect, track and ID personnel of interest<br />&bull; Recognizing, categorizing and mitigating airborne SAR artifacts<br />&bull; Ability to automatically identify targets from processed imagery<br />&bull; Collecting and characterizing information on underground facilities<br />&bull; Meeting the projected ISR bandwidth and data storage requirements for 2022-2032<br />&bull; All-weather motion imagery<br /><br />The ISR system of systems (SoS) would be deployed on airborne platforms operating at various altitudes to support specific operational conditions and with associated&nbsp;PEDnetworks. ASC/WINPA is conducting market research to identify what research has been accomplished in this field as well as to see what technology currently exists or could be modified for this need. This market research will potentially shape Air Force efforts in the FY14-24 timeframe. ASC/WIN seeks industry white papers to support this market research effort by 1 May 12. The intent of this RFI is to identify potential candidate programs and technology efforts related to the development of end-to-end ISR functionality of sensors and associated data algorithms. Components related to ISR sensors include, but are not limited to: electronics, gimbals, cryogenics, diffraction gratings, focusing lenses, FPAs, ROICs, atmospheric and temperature correction algorithms/techniques, airborne processing, interference filters, spectrometer, HRI subsystems, etc. These components do not need to be part of an existing sensor system; research and development of these components may be ongoing independent of a full system. Responses are sought from industry, academia, Government agencies, and military services.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC MIDLANT) is seeking Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUB Zone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capability to perform the proposed contracts. 

NAVFAC MIDLANT anticipates awarding a Design Bid/Build Contract for Base Power Distribution Upgrades at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek, Norfolk, VA.  

General Work Requirements: 

Project will result in the establishment of an electrical system that meets current and future capacity requirements while increasing reliability of the base distribution system; provides a new main substation on the east of the base for 34.5/13.2 KV electrical distribution; provides a new utility main substation on the west side of the base for 34.5/13.2 KV electrical distribution.
  The two 34.5 KV substations will provide power to the five existing circuits on the installation.  Project also installs new 34.5 KV Main Switchgear to distribute power to the base; installs two new 34.5 KV underwater power distribution cables under the harbor to run from the west side 34.5KN switchgear house to the new east side 34.5/13.2 KV substation.  Project will require site improvements for new substations to include grading, some minor access roadway into/around substations, curb, fencing, singes, and storm-water management.  Electrical utility work in addition to substation installation and underwater cable installation include new underground and overhead primary distribution and its infrastructure, transformers, and switchgear.

 The estimated cost range of this construction project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.

All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUB Zone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses and other certified small businesses are encouraged to respond.
  This synopsis is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and ultimate issuance of an award.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited.  If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.  All qualified firms are encouraged to respond.   It is requested that interested small businesses submit to the contracting officer a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the requested services.
  PAGES IN EXCESS OF THE FIRST 10 PAGES WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.  The documentation shall address, as a minimum, the following: 

(1) Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated. Knowledge of the state regulations within the AOR. Indicate whether your firm worked as a prime or subcontractor, contract value, brief description of how the referenced contract relates to the work described, and a Government / Agency point of contact.

(2) Company profile, to include number of offices and number of employees per office, annual receipts, office location(s), available bonding capacity per contract, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.

(3) Please indicate if you are an 8(a), HUB Zone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman Owned, and Veteran Owned.

(4) In order to assist us in determining the geographic boundaries of the contract(s) necessary to cover the services of the proposed requirement within our AOR, please identify the geographic area in which you can operate in an efficient and economical manner.

The capabilities package for this sources sought notice is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the companys ability to demonstrate existing, or developed, expertise and experience in relation to this contract.
  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the capabilities package.  Submission of a capabilities package is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. 

The Government anticipates a contract award for these contracts in September 2012. The appropriate NAICS Code is 237130 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on 24 April 2012.  Late responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>Title:	Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase Order to the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) at Colorado State University for DAYCENT Modeling and Analysis of N2O Emission Mitigation Options for Non-Rice Agricultural Lands.
Posting Date:	26 March 2012
Response Date:	09 April 2012
Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Administrative Contract Service Center (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20460
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Change Division (CCD) intends to award a sole source, fixed price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13: Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Colorado State University for DAYCENT modeling results and analysis of non-CO2 agricultural emissions and mitigation scenarios. DAYCENT is a process-based, biogeochemical model that has the ability to investigate the mitigation potential, as well as the effects on crop yields for both irrigated and non-irrigated crops, of different land management scenarios at the global and regional level.  EPA plans to utilize the global non-CO2 soils data and marginal abatement cost information from the DAYCENT modeling results to update EPA?s 2012 non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Report.
The Statement of Work (SOW)  outlines 6 major tasks: 1) the acquisition and formatting of activity data required to run DAYCENT at the global scale; 2) conducting global simulations of business-as-usual cropping and related non-CO2 and soil carbon emissions levels; 3) validating simulated business-as-usual N2O emissions; 4) conducting national and regional N2O mitigation simulations; 5) compiling and explaining of model results to contribute to EPA?s report on non-CO2 emissions; and, 6) conducting model output analysis, report writing and responding to comments. 
Developed and maintained by the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) at Colorado State University, DAYCENT is the only model qualified in this application to simulate N2O and carbon fluxes for major crop types at the desired level of detail with global and regional coverage. While it is the government?s intent to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to NREL, interested parties with the capacity and technical capability necessary to successfully perform this requirement are invited to submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing.
This is not a request for quotation (RFQ). No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions and responses should be directed to Faye Sas via e-mail at sas.faye@epa.gov. 
The point of contact for this requirement is Faye Sas, Contract Specialist, at sas.faye@epa.gov.

These states are particularly challenged by the persistent HIV/AIDS epidemic; trade liberalization creating the need to operate in highly competitive open markets; adverse effects of a changing global climate; increased international drug trafficking and an alarming rise in youth violent crime. Added to this menu of mounting issues, the sub-region has been on the receiving end of the global recession, which has caused painful economic contraction reducing government revenues and spending, business profits, employment and personal incomes. The region's vulnerability to multiple forms of natural disasters places further stress on these fragile economies and exposes their populations to grave physical risk. </span></p>

This development assistance strategy comprises four pillars - combating HIV/AIDS, pursuing economic growth through creating economic opportunities for youth, addressing deficiencies in rule of law and juvenile justice, and assisting the region to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. This assistance is focused on the six independent states of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)&nbsp;and Barbados, with additional Caribbean Regional Partnership Framework HIV/AIDS and Caribbean Basin Security Initiative activities carried out in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and in Guyana as that USAID Mission closes during 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Under IROSS, The Boeing Company provides the Directed Energy Directorate's Optics Division (AFRL/RDS) with highly skilled technical personnel for a wide range of Research and Development (R&amp;D) program management, engineering, experiment, and mission support efforts being executed at the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) on Kirtland AFB, New Mexico and at the Maui Space Surveillance Complex (MSSC) on Maui Island, Hawaii. AFRL/RDS is responsible for the development of adaptive optics, active and passive tracking of air and space targets, space surveillance, space situational awareness technologies, and propagation technologies for laser beam control and imaging applications. The sites operate small to medium-sized telescopes (0.3-3.7 m) with a variety of visible, near, mid, and far infrared sensors and imagers, laser beam directors (projecting low to medium power laser beams at ground, air, and space targets), 1000-channel class adaptive optical systems (including laser beacons at the SOR), and instruments to characterize atmospheric transmittance and strength of turbulence. SOR and MSSC also operate sensors, optics, lasers, and software that are unique to each site. IROSS contract support is required for over 45 on-going projects, including an extensive modernization and sustainment effort at MSSC of all major observatory control, mount control, data acquisition, and safety systems.</p>
<p>This action will modify the current contract for a maximum period of eighteen (18) months, consisting of a basic term of fifteen (15) months, from 1 January 2013 through 31 March 2014, and a three (3) month period for contract transition and administrative closeout actions, from 1 April 2014 through 30 June 2014. This extension is needed to satisfy R&amp;D mission needs at SOR and MSSC until the subsequent Beam Control Research, Engineering, and Analysis (BREA) contract can be competed and awarded.</p>
<p>This extension is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Due to the complex nature of this effort and the highly specialized equipment and services involved, the government anticipates The Boeing Company is the only responsible source for the extension of these services. If any other contractor was to provide these services, the Government would experience a substantial duplication of costs due to start-up actions that could not be expected to be recovered through competition, as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capacity to respond to the requirements specific to this extension. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension. Based upon the responses to this notice, the Government retains sole discretion to extend these services and to not compete the proposed contract action. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend these services.</p>
<p>Any responses to this notice of intent shall be submitted to Susan Thorpe at susan.thorpe@kirtland.af.mil and are due on or before 9 April 2012, 12:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time (MDT).</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address:<br />3550 Aberdeen SE<br />Kirtland AFB, New Mexico 87117</p>
<p>Place of Performance:<br />Albuquerque, New Mexico 87117<br />United States<br />and<br />Maui, Hawaii 96753<br />United States</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Army - Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (ARIEM) intends to award a sole source fixed price purchase order under simplified acquisition procedures to The Mathworks Inc., 3 Apple Hill Dr., Natick, MA 01760-2098, for nine (9) Matlab software licenses including toolboxes, as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253, as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This is being done as it would prohibitively expensive replace the Matlab software ARIEM currently uses with another of comparable nature, it would reduce efficiency as the current users would have to retrain with the new software, and all old files would have to be converted and would require verifying the existing code-base and data sets to any replacement environment.<br>The proposed contract action is for supplies which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This notice of intent to purchase supplies from only one source is not a request for proposals; however interested persons may submit their capability to respond to this requirement to the point of contact listed below by April 5, 2012.<br>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil">NMLC Research</a>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 6.302-1 to Oak Hill Genetics for an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract that provides for the delivery of healthy male and female Yorkshire swine for a period of 24-months.  The animals (swine) shall be healthy, disease free and at the required weight in 100% of the ordered quantity in each delivery, or entire shipment shall be replaced.  The animal facility requires United States Department of Agriculture approved Class A animal breeder license. The requirement shall have an environment, care and handling of animals as developed by the current supplier to avoid the skewing of data in ongoing research efforts.
  

Currently, Naval Medical Research Unit  San Antonio (NAMRU-SA), is using the government purchase card to buy animals (swine) from Oak Hills Genetics, Inc.   NAMRU-SA has been using Oak Hills Genetics for past animal (swine) purchases in research that focuses on the protection, resuscitation and stabilization of combat casualties at Echelon 1 and 2 points of care in the combat theater.  In the upcoming months, the number of animals necessary for purchase will increase to a level that exceeds the authority to purchase under the Government purchase card program.  

It is critical for NAMRU-SA future scientific research efforts to have healthy, disease free animals from one vender; this will ensure the scientific data generated is consistent, which is critical when testing different vender devices under that same research environment.
  Due to Oak Hill Genetics early involvement providing animals in this ongoing research effort; they must continue to provide this supply until commencement as to avoid the injection of inconsistency in study results.  In addition, it is imperative that a comparison of previous data collected in ongoing research, to potentially new data be created, collected, and reviewed under the same controls to ensure an apples-to-apples analysis is been  performed.  This is critical to the integrity of the entire study and can only be accomplished through the use of the same supplier.  In addition, Oak Hill Genetics has an established history of delivering 100% healthy lots.  Loss of one or two animals due to diseases will cause a major disruption on data collection and data analysis.
  Further, the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which provides regulatory oversight in federally funded projects requiring animal use, requires proof that the research team is working to reduce the number of animals used in the protocols as the study progresses.  This can only be accomplished by using the current vendor, as this supplier eliminates the need to acquire additional animals through duplication of previous study efforts.     

The estimated value of this contract is $450,000.00. The period of performance for this contract is anticipated to be a base period of 12-months, followed by one 12-month option periods for a total of 24-months.  Previous to purchases from Oak Hill Genetics with the Government purchase card, market research was conducted by NAMRU-SA, it found that other animal venders could have been used in the past, but prior to use, the animals became sick and had to be euthanized.
  If future requirements exist that do not involve the same research efforts, the government will solicit through full and open competition to remove barriers.

All capability statements received by 10:00AM Eastern Time on April 10, 2012, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		4510-00-NIB-0010	<br />Name:		Dispenser, Wall Mounted, Antibacterial Soap, 1000 mL, Dove Gray<br />Description:	Compact, wall mounted, antibacterial lotion soap dispenser with a one-hand push dispenser for 1,000 mL refills. This single unit dispenser is dove gray in color and has a unique dispensing valve with portion control to minimize waste. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		4510-00-NIB-0012<br />Name:		Dispenser, Wall Mounted, Antibacterial Soap, 2000 mL, Dove Gray<br />Description:	Compact, wall mounted, antibacterial lotion soap dispenser with a one-hand push dispenser for 2,000 mL refills. This single unit dispenser is dove gray in color and has a unique dispensing valve with portion control to minimize waste. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		4510-00-NIB-0010	<br />Similar Items:	2125-06; GOJ212506</p>
<p>NSN:		4510-00-NIB-0012<br />Similar Items:	2225-08; GOJ 2225-08</p>
<p><br />In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-0988<br />Name:		Cover, Record Book, Digital Camo, 6" x 9"<br />Description:	6" x 9" record book cover in Digital Camo, with velcro strip for name tape and rank. Features velcro holder with velcro pocket for additional documents, pen holder, pocket sleeve. Fits 5" x 8" record books NSNs 7530-00-222-3521 and 7530-00-286-6207. Record book not included. UoI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-0988<br />Similar Items:	034LAC (RW 28); 9901-ACU-7388</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 9, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.205(a) and 6.302-1(a)(2), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a sole source contract under FAR 6.302-1 "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." FEMA intends to award this contract to Cassidian Communications, Franklin, TN, 37067. The contract is for a web-based interface with enhancements to existing hardware/software that was designed and manufactured by Cassidian Communications. The existing software is proprietary and patented and only Cassidian possesses the corporate knowledge required to modify the existing system. Cassidian Communications will upgrade the existing FEMA ENS to meet the requirements of the Federal Continuity Directives and DHS Personnel Accountability System. <br />Market research has demonstrated that no other software or firm can provide web-based interface with enhancements to existing hardware/software supported by Cassidian Communications. As stated earlier, the ENS utilizes operating systems that are proprietary to Cassidian Communications. Installing and uploading another product from another contractor will void the warranty with Cassidian Communications and possibly create interoperability issues.<br />In addition, FEMA Directive 262-3 dated 11-3-11 designates the ENS system as the official FEMA solution for emergency notification. No other notification systems have been authorized for FEMA use.<br />See initial JOFOC (attachment) for Section 508 and security requirements. <br />The total value of this requirement is anticipated to be approximately $1.5 million and the expected period of performance is to be one (1) base year and four (4) option years for a total of five (5) years from date of award.<br />FEMA is aware of no other firm, other than Cassidian Communications that can provide the type of services and software maintenance described here and in the JOFOC. However, any firm that believes it is capable of providing equivalent services that meet the specifications stated and is an ENS that is authorized by FEMA shall e-mail a Statement of Specifications and associated product literature to Christine.Todd@dhs.gov no later than 2:00 PM EST on February 16, 2012. <br />

inSalmo  Individual-Based Salmon Life Cycle Framework Model
Vendor:LANG RAILSBACK & ASSOCIATES250 California Ave.Arcata, CA 95521
The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the US Bureau of Reclamation need additional technical assistance in the further development of the inSalmo model.  Mr. Railsback developed the current version of the inSalmo in 2004, completing the most recent work in September of 2011.  He is the technical expert and understands the unique details of the model.  He has provided workshop training session to agency staff in September 2011.  This workshop provided attendees with working knowledge of how to use the model.  To the best of the USFWS knowledge this training has not been provided other potential contractors, so any contactor other than Mr. Railsback would need extensive training before they could attempt to develop the model further.
Mr. Railsback and his associate Brett Harvey and FWS agency biologists are the only people who have a solid working knowledge of the field data used to calibrate and validate the current version of the model.  His team understands the additional data that is needed to further perform model validation required in the scope of work.  The selection of any other vendor will increase both time and cost to calibrate the model and Steve Railsback would have to be hired to provide them with extensive training.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Services located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with University of Washington. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contract is for estimation of the transport of watershed-based nutrients and pathogens to shellfish growing areas under alternative climate, marine, and watershed conditions. The project will use a field and quantitative modeling &lsquo;source-transport-fate' assessment approach to classify the vulnerability of shellfish growing areas to closures caused by watershed and marine-derived pathogens. Outputs will include 1) Final maps of the spatial distribution of terrestrial and marine-derived sources of nutrients and pathogens in specific shellfish growing areas in Puget Sound; 2) Final field-validated model estimates of likely marine transport of nutrients and pathogens to shellfish growing areas under alternative future climate and restoration strategies; and 3) Final assessments of the fate of such nutrients and pathogens in terms of changes in ecosystem service values provided by shellfish growing areas. Fate-related outputs include: (a) Final estimates of changes in filtration rates and total biomass produced by shellfish under different scenarios, and (b) Final projections of the change in commercial and recreational harvest opportunities, economic revenues, and social consequences of closures. Ultimately, this work will produce a suite of tools that will help inform management and shellfish growers in assessing current and future threats to shellfish yields available for harvest, and the potential effectiveness of strategies to minimize these threats. The University of Washington Team is uniquely qualified to conduct this work because proposed contractor has already developed and validated an oceanographic model that covers Puget Sound and provides the outputs needed for other NWFSC project tasks, they have unique set of skills to undertake this project. UW can provide the complex hydrodynamic models that 1) already have been calibrated and run throughout the Puget Sound, and 2) provide a detailed view of coastal-ocean influences on Puget Sound circulation, and 3) can straightforwardly incorporate scenarios covering climate change and land-use change. There are no other models that can produce the same modeling information on the transport of watershed-based nutrients and pathogens. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with period of performance commencing approximately from date of award through Sept 30, 2012. The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M. It is the Government's belief that only University of Washington can complete this project. This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be faxed to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or provided by e-mail to maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition. ****The Western Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC>Per request of the Joint Program Executive Office, Joint Tactical Radio System(JTRS), the JTRS Reference Implementation Laboratory (JRIL), in coordinationwith the Assistant Secretary to the Army for Acquisitions, Logistics, andTechnology (ASAAL&T) System of Systems Integration Directorate (SOSI), will behosting a Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) Interoperability Quicklook (WIQ)and a Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) Interoperability Quicklook (SIQ). Both theSIQ and the WIQ will be conducted in three Phases. The first two Phases will bea laboratory event (Phase I will be the Performance Characterization evaluationand Phase II will be the Interoperability Characterization evaluation) andPhase III will be a field event. The objective of the SIQ and the WIQ is toprovide vendors the opportunity to test their platforms in a heterogeneousnetwork, serve as a cost-effective risk reduction exercise, be utilized withinthe Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) decision criteria, and support futureprocurement activities for radios that will run WNW and/or SRW. SIQ and WIQalignment with NIE events is as follows:- WIQ Phase I will support NIE 13.1 Decision Point 2- WIQ Phase II will support both NIE 13.1 Lab Based Risk Reduction (LBRR) andNIE 13.2 Decision Point 1- SIQ Phases I and II will support NIE 13.2 Decision Point 1- SIQ/WIQ Phase III will support NIE 13.2 Decision Point 2The overall JRIL schedule is shown in attachment A.WIQThe WNW RIL will host the WIQ. The WIQ Phases I and II laboratory event will beheld at the Space and Naval Warfare System Centers (SSC) Atlantic, WNW RIL atCharleston, SC. WIQ Phase III will be held at the Electronic Proving Ground,Fort Huachuca, AZ. The WIQ is expected to include JTRS Program of Record (PoR)and non-JTRS PoR developers that are willing to provide suitable (i.e.,suitable for integration and field use) WNW 4.0.5.1 capable hardware withnecessary support personnel.Current Performance Characterization testing to be conducted at SSC-LANTstarting on 9 April 2012 will be credited to vendors for WIQ Phase I. Phase Iis expected to last two weeks. WIQ Phase II to be conducted at SSC-LANTstarting on 23 April 2012 will focus on Interoperability Characterization.Phase II is expected to last two weeks. WIQ Phase III to be conducted atElectronic Proving Grounds, Fort Huachuca, AZ starting on 24 September 2012will be the field event. Testing is expected to last two weeks. Testing for allPhases will provide an evaluation of each vendor's level of interoperabilitywith the AN/VRC-107 (GMR). Evaluation will also include stability andfunctionality in a multi-vendor heterogeneous network. Further functionalityand performance testing can be requested from the WNW RIL through a CommercialService Agreement (CSA) 2539(b). A number of test cases will be designed,documented in the test plan and offered to participants at the event.Participants will be permitted to select the tests in which they wish toparticipate. Results of testing will be provided to the JPEO JTRS and SOSI, butanalysis of a particular vendors testing will not be provided to other vendorsand proprietary information will be protected.The JTRS Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) will be used to createconfigurations for the AN/VRC-107 radio and a plain-text version of the RadioMission Data set (RMDS) will be distributed to all participants for evaluationand integration prior to the test event.In order to participate in testing, vendors will be required to have met thefollowing set of entrance criteria:- WNW 4.0.5.1 Capable Radio, suitable for integration in a vehicle and use inthe field- TRANSEC Implementation- WNW HAIPE Implementation- Red-to-Red Communication- Red and/or Black Key ImplementationIf a vendor is interested in testing but cannot meet the entrance criteriaas stated above, please contact Brett Bendt for further information.Interested parties should contact Brett Bendt at SSC-LANT(brett.bendt@navy.mil) no later than 30 March 2012 to register for attendance.Parties having questions should direct those questions to Bryan Glover,Contract Specialist, at bryan.glover@navy.mil and Diane Thornewell, PCO, atdiane.thornewell@navy.mil. Interested parties will be provided the SoftwareTest Plan for the upcoming WIQ.SIQThe SRW RIL will host the SIQ. The SIQ Phases I and II laboratory event will beheld at the CERDEC S&TCD SRW RIL at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. SIQPhase III will be held at the Electronic Proving Ground, Fort Huachuca, AZ. TheSIQ is expected to include JTRS Program of Record (PoR) and non-JTRS PoRdevelopers whom are willing to provide suitable (i.e., suitable for integrationand field use) SRW 1.1.1 capable hardware with necessary support personnel.SIQ Phase I to be conducted at CERDEC S&TCD starting on 16 May 2012 with theoption of vendor checkouts in the lab starting 7 May 2012 will focus onPerformance Characterization. Given the number of potential vendor radios undertest, Phase I will be broken into two, two-week increments. The first increment(16 May to 29 May) will include the first set of vendor radios to be tested andthe second increment (1 June to 16 June) will include the second set of vendorradios to be tested. SIQ Phase II to be conducted at CERDEC S&TCD on 14 June2012 will focus on Interoperability Characterization of all vendor radios undertest. Testing is expected to last two weeks. SIQ Phase III to be conducted atElectronic Proving Grounds, Fort Huachuca, AZ starting on 10 September 2012will be the field event. Testing is expected to last two weeks. Testing for allPhases will provide an evaluation of each vendor's level of interoperabilitywith the JTRS PoR radio running SRW 1.1.1 and between each participantsradios. Evaluation will also include stability and functionality in amulti-vendor heterogeneous network. Further functionality and performancetesting can be requested from the SRW RIL through a Testing Service Agreement(TSA). A number of test cases will be designed, documented in the test plan andoffered to participants at the event. Participants will be permitted to selectthe tests in which they wish to participate.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the paper-based versions are also acceptable and shall be returned with the offer.<br><br>52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items.<br>(a)   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) in accordance with FAR 15.101-2.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>(i) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY. In order for the offeror to be considered technically capable, the Government will make a determination by evaluating the following: (1) ability of the offeror to provide the brand-name item with required specifications, and (2) Ability of the offeror to meet the delivery schedule/terms as stated in the relevant section of this solicitation.<br>Factor 1 Roll-up:  Failure to meet any of these requirements shall render an "unacceptable" rating under this factor and the offeror will no longer be eligible for award.<br><br>(ii) FACTOR 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE.  Past performance will be evaluated to determine the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements and will be assessed either an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" rating.  The past performance submitted for evaluation must be recent and relevant.  To be recent, the effort must have been performed during the last three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation; to be relevant, the effort must be similar in complexity and scope, i.e. the contract was for a similar piece of equipment in terms of the equipment's intended purpose and functions as the one requested under the instant solicitation.  The offeror shall select up to three (3) of its Government customers (Local, State and/or Federal) for which it has performed recent/relevant efforts as described herein and forward a copy of the attached Past Performance Questionnaire for their completion.  The questionnaires shall be completed by the contracting activity and returned directly to the Contract Specialist at email address provided in the instructions accompanying the form.  The burden of ensuring the completed questionnaires are submitted to the Contract Specialist rests with the offeror.  Offerors without a record of recent/relevant past performance SHALL provide a statement to that fact; offerors whom fall under this category will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "acceptable" rating.<br><br>Rating Descriptions:<br>Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br>Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>Method for Collecting Past Performance Information:<br>The Government will evaluate the customer-completed Past Performance Questionnaires.  The information submitted may be verified by the Government by contacting the references provided.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to query other past performance sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).<br><br>Factor 2 Roll-up:  This factor must receive a rating of "acceptable" in order to be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.<br><br>(Iii) FACTOR 3 - PRICE. Price will be evaluated to determine if the offeror's proposed price is fair, reasonable, and balanced utilizing any one or a combination of the price analysis techniques identified in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2).<br><br>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.<br><br>- End of Provision 52.212-2. <br><br><br>52.212-5, Contract terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)American Sign Language Interpreting ServicePN Regional Dive Team TrainingApril 30 - May 4, 2012Hoodsport, Washington
1.0  INTRODUCTION:  
1.1  Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation): Reclamation is a water management agency with 600 dams in the 17 western states.  We are known best for construction of dams, power plants, and canals, including Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River, and Folsom Dam on the American River.  Reclamation is the largest wholesaler of water in the country and second largest producer of hydroelectric power in the western US.  Reclamation is organized into five regions (Mid-Pacific [MP], Great Plains [GP], Lower Colorado [LC], Upper Colorado [UC], and Pacific Northwest [PN]).  For further information about Reclamation, please see www.usbr.gov. 
1.2  Office Name/Designation:  Technical Service Center (TSC).  The mission/vision of the TSC is to be Reclamation's preferred provider of science and engineering services.  The TSC is a world-class engineering, science, research, and support center for projects related to water resources. The TSC provide specialized expertise to Reclamation's programs, regions, and area offices, to other Federal agencies, and to international customers.  For further information about the TSC, please see www.usbr.gov/pmts/tech_services/. 2.0  SCOPE:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for sign language interpretation services to be performed in Hoodsport, WA and Hood Canal, WA during April 30, 2012 through May 4, 2012.  The Federal employee is attending a week long training course which is required of all members of the Bureau of Reclamation Underwater Investigation Team (scuba diving team).  Approximately 55 hours of classroom sessions, water exercises, and meal breaks are anticipated (see tentative Diving Training Schedule below).  The Federal employee is deaf and the training instructors require sign language interpretation services to communicate with the Federal employee.  The interpreter must hold certification through the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, as listed below in Section 3.0.
The headquarter and classroom location for the training is at the following address:  
Yellow House, 23891 HWY 101 N Hoodsport, WA 98548

The trainers and training are contracted and provided through Edmonds Technical Diving Services: http://www.etds.org/ 
Underwater scuba diving exercises are scheduled to be held in Hood Canal at several nearby locations, depending on the nature of the exercises, with the majority of the exercises taking place across the street from the headquarter.  The interpreter shall provide his/her own means of land transportation and must be prepared for all possible weather conditions.
The deaf Federal Employee is scheduled to attend all training sessions. The interpreter provider agency will be notified immediately of any changes made to the schedule.  The interpreter shall be available and present for the duration of the training.  As mentioned above, there are some water exercises on shore and on boat.  The interpreter will not be expected to go into the water while scuba diving is taking place, but the interpreter shall be available to interpret at the locations mentioned above.
3.0  PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS: The interpreter must be certified by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID, www.rid.org).  The interpreter must currently hold one of the following national certificates:  CSC, MCSC, CI, IC, NAD IV, NAD V, NIC, NIC Advanced, or NIC Master.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for commercial services. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 with a small business size standard of $7.0M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>Responsible quoters shall provide pricing for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity (1) Job. The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, travel and services necessary to conduct measure the visibility of a forklift, in accordance with the following statement of work:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) develops, advances and deploys measurement science and standards to speed development, adoption, and integration of leading-edge intelligent technologies to advance U.S. manufacturing performance.</p>
<p>Within ISD, the Next Generation Robotics and Automation Program addresses the measurement science and standards necessary to enable the next generation of smart robots and automation systems and to ensure their adoption in manufacturing in the U.S. at scales ranging from the very small to the very large. The Program addresses major barriers including perception, manipulation, human-robot interaction, and safety. It does so through targeted projects that develop standards and performance measures that will help drive research and spur development and applications of intelligent automation that can operate in real world manufacturing and in close proximity with people.</p>
<p>Forklifts are readily used in manufacturing and near people. However, lack of operator visibility for forklift drivers is a critical issue requiring improved forklift designs and/or augmented imaging systems that can provide visibility for blind spots to operators. Current measurement of visibility is crude using light to cast shadows on test boards and count the dark squares. Therefore, improved measurement technology and methods are required to improve forklifts.</p>
<p>TASKS<br />The Contractor shall use advanced measurement technology to measure the non-visible operator regions of a forklift similar to current standards, to analyze the results and provide an initial design for an automated method for measuring visibility.<br /><br />1. The Contractor shall measure the visibility of a forklift in accordance with tests outlined in the ANSI/ITSDF B56.11.6 - 2005, Evaluation of Visibility from Powered Industrial Trucks; Downloadable from http://www.itsdf.org/pB56.asp); and Attachment I, entitled "Measurement and Evaluation of Visibility Experiments for Powered Industrial Vehicles," NIST Internal Report (NISTIR) #7837, December 2011, using only advanced sensor system(s) (i.e., high definition laser scanner, surveyor, geospatial measurement device and/or 3D imager) detailed as:</p>
<p>a. Temporarily mount/clamp the manually-moveable, as specified in the standards and NISTIR, advanced sensor system to a NIST-owned forklift. Mounting shall allow <br />advanced sensor system rotation and sliding capability to simulate the forklift operator head motion throughout the average (standard specified) volume. NIST will provide a <br />Clark GPX 50 forklift, or equivalent for the purpose of work under the resultant purchase order. Work with the forklift must be performed on-site at NIST;<br /><br />b. Collect and analyze the measured data showing graphically and analytically the results of operator visibility for the forklift;</p>
<p>c. Findings shall report on operator visibility showing forklift obstructions as compared to the current standard criteria of all standard ANSI B56.11.6 and ISO/FDIS 13564-<br />1 tests discussed in NISTIR #7837 for powered industrial vehicles.</p>
<p>2. The Contractor shall provide a final report of results of the operator visibility of a manned forklift, according to the eleven tests listed in the above standards and NISTIR, using advanced optical measurement technology as compared to current standard methods. The report must also provide recommendations of the need for advanced measurement techniques for powered industrial vehicles over current standard light shadow methods.</p>
<p>Two printed copies of the detailed final report shall be submitted in full color and electronically; Raw 3D data point clouds and models of the tests performed shall be provided with the report on storage media such as CD's, DVD's, hard drive or other file-sharing medium;<br /><br />3. The Contractor shall provide an initial design for an automated visibility measurement system for powered industrial vehicles. The format shall include 2D and 3D strawman or concept CAD drawings, block diagrams of control system designs, discussion of system setup and use including estimated time for each, explanation of how the system will meet ANSI B56.11.6 and ISO/FDIS 13564-1 (discussed in NISTIR #7837) tests and a description of how the system data will be computed, analyzed and displayed in the standard specified report.<br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance shall be from the date of award through August 30, 2012.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />Work shall be performed at the Contractor's site and on-site at NIST. Work on-site at NIST shall take place during regular business hours. Hours must be scheduled in advance with the NIST Technical Contact (to be identified at the time of award), however, must be within regular business hours of 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM Eastern Time.</p>

<p>Coast Guard Acquisition Procedures (CGAP)<br />APPENDIX C - CHAPTER 3033 <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(End of Clauses and Provisions)</p>
<p>Quotes are required to be submitted via email to Devin Fitzpatrick at devin.j.fitzpatrick@uscgmil on Friday March 30, 2012 no later than 3:00p.m. EST.<br />For questions regarding the solicitation please contact Devin Fitzpatrick, Contract Specialist at devin.j.fitzpatrick@uscg.mil or 202-475-3781.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following Statement/Information is in reference to this Acquisition being considered to be a Sole Source Acquisition based on the following as provided to the Contracting Officer and hereby agreed upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>(1) Agency, Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>US Coast Guard Command, Control, and Communications<br />Engineering Center (C3CEN), 4000 Coast Guard Blvd, Portsmouth,<br />VA 23703.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>Service warranty renewal for the Universal Power Supply (UPS) <br />installed inside C3CEN's Command Centers Laboratory. Note: <br />C3CEN's Command Centers Laboratory UPS consists of the following <br />components:</p>
<p>- UPS Systems/Cabinets (4)<br />- Battery Cabinets (8)<br />- Paralleling Cabinet (1)<br />- Foundation Power Center (FPC) Cabinets (3) <br /><br />(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).</p>
<p>Provide service and maintenance for C3CEN's Uninterruptable <br />Power Supply (UPS)</p>
<p>Site address: C3CEN / 4000 CG Blvd / Portsmouth, VA / 23703:<br /><br />This contract will have a base year and 2 Option Years</p>
<p>Total Estimated Cost for the base and two Options: $87,000.00</p>
<p><br />(4) Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition IAW FAR 6.302-1 (c)</p>
<p>IAW 6.302-1 (2) (ii) Supplies/Services are deemed to be available only<br />from the original source Emerson/Liebert, equipment, including major <br />components must be manufactured and maintained by <br />Emerson/Liebert technicians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>Emerson Network Power /Liebert Services' Customer Engineers<br />are factory trained specifically to test and service components and <br />parts associated with C3CEN's Command Centers Laboratory UPS. <br />This UPS was originally purchased from Emerson /Liebert, and is <br />composed entirely of parts and equipment Emerson /Liebert <br />technicians are qualified to maintain.</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.</p>
<p>RFQ will be posted on FEDBIZOPS with statement that any <br />Contractor that feels that they can provide these Supplies or<br />Services as listed may provide a Quotation</p>
<p>(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Open purchase products will be determined to be fair and reasonable<br />based on past purchase of similar items and FEDBIZOPS competition.</p>
<p>(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>Two companies, APC and Integrated Power Sources of Virginia,<br />were contacted, and both reported that they are unable to provide <br />similar warranty service matching Emerson Network Power / Liebert <br />Services. No other companies were located that could provide<br />market research concerning similar warranty service.</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: <br /><br />As per Emerson Network Power / Liebert Services' Sole Source<br />Service Provider document - included with this package - <br />Emerson/Liebert is a sole-source manufacturer/service provider that <br />doesn't support third party organizations with technical back-up or <br />guarantee parts availability. Additionally, if a contract is held for these <br />warranty services by a third party and a critical situation arises where <br />Liebert Services is called to the site, the work performed will be billed<br />back to the end user and not the third party.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is strongly recommended that C3CEN continue its <br />current warranty contract relationship for the Command Centers <br />Laboratory UPS with Emerson/Liebert to ensure its future reliability as<br />per original factory specifications.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>None at this time</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>None at this time</p>
<p>(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>JAMES A. LASSITER<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p>(13) Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel.</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Governments minimum need and <br />the supporting data which forms a basis for this justification, is complete <br />and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<DESC><p>The mobile unit is not as much an extension of an existing unit as it is using existing shelving to integrate into the unit to complete it. There should be a total of four shelves in each of the 36" deep systems including the base shelf, and a total of six shelves in the 24" deep systems including the base shelf. The shelving shall include complete back and side panels on each system, a digital keypad access system, and motorized movement. The current shelves are grey, and the new shelving should match those. A ceiling and a floor are not necessary and neither are doors.</p>
<p>The digital keypad shall be programmed so each user enters their personal code and the unit will automatically open the fixture that way it can be tracked who the last person to access the equipment stored in each fixture was. It will not interface with any existing security systems. There shall be one key pad per shelving unit and they shall be programmed so each authorized person will have one code assigned per person that will grant them access to all units but no more than one unit can be open at a time. There shall be codes for up to 200 people as well as a safety mechanism so a person cannot be crushed between the units when closing (not a counter).<br />The fixtures not being replaced will be altered to match the new units being installed. This means a steel back, two linoleum sides, and a key pad will be installed on each unit. The wood on the existing shelves will be replaced with ventilated or corrugated shelves (either one). They will need to be on the same track as the other units with motorized movement as well. At this time they are stationary. The first unit will remain stationary but must still be on the track to match height, all others must be mobile. The last two shelving units will face each other so the entire system can be locked up when not in use. To do so, all mobile units shall be closed up towards the stationary unit.<br />All new shelving units' parts must be compatible with the parts of the existing unit manufactured by Lyon.<br /><br />When open, the aisle width shall be 61.5".<br />The shelf arrangement will be as follows:<br />36" Units - base shelf, plus three more shelves approximately 36" apart<br />24" Units - base shelf, plus five more shelves approximately 25" apart<br />The structure shall be designed to support 1,000lbs per shelf, including the top of the unit. It is a possibility that material may be stored up there as well.<br />Tracks will be built into a concrete base so carts may be rolled over the tracks without difficulty</p>
<p>CORRRECTION: The requested mobile storage unit will replace the existing fixed storage unit up to the last two fixtures. These two fixtures are shown in the posted pictures outside of the yellow marked area. These two fixtures will be modified to have backing, as well as the digital keypad that will be on the new fixtures. All fixtures, new and old, will be motorized on an above ground track which will be installed on the existing concrete floor. To secure the unit tracking, small anchors may be installed into the concrete floor. Anchors shall be no larger than &frac14; in. x 2 in.</p>
<p>The old fixtures being replaced are shown within the yellow marked area in the pictures posted. Our own personnel will be removing these fixtures. Therefore, removal shall not be included in this buy.</p>

<DESC>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is soliciting proposals for initial purchase of ten (10) and up to 200 additional BAO Kit Operational Control Systems (OCS). <br />2. This combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items was prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation FA8629-12-R-2417 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), using the streamlined procedures for evaluation of commercial items as outlined in FAR 12.6. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28. The associated NAICS code is 335999. <br />3. The purpose of the Battlefield Air Operations Kit (BAO Kit) program is to upgrade the current equipment suite of the Battlefield Airmen (BA) in five (5) different areas &ndash; communications, computers, human input/output (human I/O), power generation and management and software. As such, it is also part of the broader BA program, currently addressing requirements for Combat Control Teams (CCT), Special Tactics Squadrons (STS), Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) personnel and Guardian Angel pararescue personnel. The OCS consists of a wearable vest with cable runs, cables, power manager and computer, thereby incorporating the areas of computers, power generation and management and communications. The primary radio for the BAO Kit is the AN/PRC-117G radio manufactured by Harris RF. When carried, the battery can provide power for the entire BAO Kit. Specifications for the battery connector are included in Attachment 2 to this RFP. The Battery end of the cable will be a 90 degree elbow connector that conforms to the side of the battery. <br />4. The intended use of this system is in military field operations in a range of environmental conditions. The expected system life cycle before replacement required is two-years -- notwithstanding catastrophic damage or other than normal wear, use and transportation. Operating conditions include environmental ranges as described in the specification below but can be described as continuous wear and operations by military personnel for the durations specified below in dismounted on-the-ground conditions, operation in military and commercial ground vehicles, and transportation either being worn or removed in various aircraft and helicopters. Personnel should not be encumbered by the system snagging on vehicle parts when either wearing or carrying the system while entering or exiting vehicles and aircraft. Usage environments can be expected to stress the systems&rsquo; integration, fasteners, belts, and pockets. The OCS is expected to be easy for operators to quickly don and remove in various postures (standing, sitting and prone). While being worn, the OCS should not impede other wearer actions such as arm freedom of movement required to operate shoulder-fired weapons, climb, and fast rope. Warranty logistics and depot repair operations will be managed by the vendor with ready spares to replace any failed systems returned for repair. Continuity of operations in the field will be managed by the Government. <br />5. Because this is an evaluation effort, the Air Force may award up to four (4) contracts under this effort. Or, the Air Force may determine to award no contracts at all, depending upon the responses received. In the future, the Air Force may proceed with a follow-on procurement, depending on the results of this evaluation effort. <br />6. Respondents to this RFP should submit the following in response to this synopsis/solicitation: a. A fact sheet and an initial bid for ten (10) Operational Control System with the attributes listed on Attachment 1 to the RFP package. (CLIN 0001) b. A bid for an additional purchase of up to 300 OCS. These may be purchased as funding becomes available in the future. Therefore, all offerors shall propose any quantity discount(s) available, and what the minimum order is to receive any quantity discount. This additional purchase will be placed as an option in the ensuing contract. (CLIN 0002) c. A bid for a cable to harvest energy from the Glenair connector on the AN/PRC-117G MicroSun battery (117G Battery) to power the kit through your power management solution. This will be placed as an option in the ensuing contract. (CLIN 0003) Additional details for the connection will be provided when the option is exercised. d. Information on system warranties. Please state what is included in the standard warranty for the system. In addition, please state if higher level warranties are available, what they entail, and the costs associated with those warranties. In the event that this office determines to purchase a higher level warranty, that warranty will be included as a separate CLIN in the contract. (CLIN 0004) e. Two (2) Operational Control Systems. (as discussed in paragraph 8 below). <br />7. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 5212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is incorporated and the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. As indicated on the attached Standard Form 1449, award will be made on the basis of a simplified trade-off. In this instance, technical selection criteria will be of greater importance than cost. The Government will also evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total cost for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). General statements that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, or paraphrases of the RFP specification in whole or in part will not constitute compliance with this requirement concerning the content of the technical requirement. Offerors shall complete and submit with each proposal FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications &ndash; Commercial Items and DFARS 242.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications &ndash; Commercial Items. <br />8. Two (2) paper copies should be submitted to the address listed in paragraph 10 below which should cover all the information in paragraph 6 above. Paper copies shall be clearly labeled &ldquo;Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information&rdquo; on the cover sheets and in close proximity to this type of information, on each applicable page. Proprietary/Competition Sensitive information shall be protected from disclosure. E-mail copies of the paper submittal shall be accepted. In addition, in accordance with FAR clause 52-212.01(d), two (2) Operational Control Systems shall be delivered to the program office CONCURRENT with your paper proposal for additional evaluation. One system shall have Windows XP operating system on the computer, and the other shall have Window 7 operating system on the computer. After review is complete, the systems shall be returned to the offeror. Please include name, address, and shipping information (including vendor&rsquo;s FedEx numbers) for the return of these items. <br />9. First delivery of ten OCS is scheduled for 30 days after the contract is awarded. The place of delivery is listed in the model contract attached hereto. The contractor shall propose a delivery schedule for the remainder of the OCS systems. <br />10. Responses and prototypes shall be received no later than 20 April 2012. Paper/e-mail submittals and prototypes shall be sent to ASC/WISK, Attn: Jarrett Stamper, 1895 Fifth Street, Bldg 46, Wright-Patterson AFB

Unless a significant price disparity exists which deems a large business suitable for award, award will be made to a small business. Multiple awards will not be considered. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, offerors' initial proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint. At a minimum, the offeror must submit an offer schedule which asserts they will provide the supplies/services to the minimum standards indicated in the solicitation/PWS. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government.  "Best value" means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In accordance with FAR 12.602 & FAR 13.106-2, technical, price & past performance will be considered in the streamlined evaluation. In the best value decision, the Government may consider any readily available value indicators (examples include past performance, special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance, trade-in considerations, probable life of the item, warranty considerations, maintenance availability, environmental and energy efficiency considerations, and delivery terms). This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror. The Government's selection of a higher-priced, higher rated offer will be supported by a determination that the technical/past performance superiority of the higher-priced offer warrants the additional cost involved. <br><br>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, 52.212-4 is amended as follows: Paragraph (g) (1): Change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices.

Solicitation Number: SOL-CI-12-00036  Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation
Site Gas Regulators Synopsis:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Testing and Advanced Technology Division (TATD), and the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has a requirement for two stage gas regulators, with the specifications listed below.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Refer to SOL-CI-12-00036 when responding to this request. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55. This acquisition is a total set-a-side for small business. The NAICS code is 325120, the size standard is 1,000 Employees.
Background:  The TATD (Testing and Advanced Technology Division) is modifying gas supply system in the new CTF (Cold test facility) and SC03 vehicle testing areas. To maintain consistent gas flows to these and any future sites connected to this cylinder supply location, TATD will institute a dual stage gas delivery system from the new manifold being installed in these testing locations. A dual stage gas regulator will be added inline to each gas being delivered to the two analyzer benches located in the CTF and SC03 test area. This will allow the initial gas cylinder regulator to flow at a higher pressure and secondary site regulators will correct for gas pressure fluctuation at each analyzer location and maintain a consistent gas source enabling improved gas sample readings for testing and calibration.  Specifications: The contractor shall furnish two stage gas regulators in standard brass chrome plated versions (Quantity 80) and  corrosive stainless steel versions (Quantity 20). The regulator size is critical due to the limited space available at each gas supply rack. The gas valve rack to which these regulators will be connected is only 12 inches deep and 33 inches wide.  Due to the varying gasses needed and their locations on the supplied forty gas lines the regulators size must not exceed 1-3/4" body width.  Both stages will be fitted with a gauge. First stage will be sized 0 to 500psi second stage will be sized 0-60 psi. Gauges will be constructed of appropriate material for their use. Total depth of regulator body with attached gauges must not exceed 3" over all height of regulator assembly must not exceed 6". Inlet and outlet ports will be ?" NPT thread. Due to its proximity to other regulators in the valve rack the inlet must port from the top. The outlet must port f rom the rear of the regulator. The regulator must be capable of inlet pressures up to 3000psi in case of cylinder regulator failure. The regulator output flow must be at least 10 SLPM at 25psi at an inlet pressure of 250 psi.   Regulators shall be off the shelf commercially available assembled from standard designed parts with no special machined components.  
Payment:  Payment will be made upon acceptance and submission of a properly prepared invoice from the Contractor. The Purchase Order Number assigned to this contract must appear on all invoices.  The Purchase Order Number is noted in Block #3 of Optional Form 347, "Order for Supplies or Services" to be sent to the Contractor at the time of award.
All supplies shall be provided to the EPA NVFEL located at 2565 Plymouth Rd., Ann Arbor, MI 48105 within 56 days after receipt of award. The F.O.B. point shall be destination.

We must follow strict DEA guidelines.  The first 5 digits of the above NDC's should identify the actual manufacture, however we have contacted 2 major pharmaceutical distributors and they are unable to identify those NDC's.  We searched using other means, and are still unable to identify the actual manufacture.   Please advise. <br><br>Answer:<br>1. Fentanyl and Midazolam are MARKET SHORT.  <br>2. American Society of Health-Systems is not a manufacturer.  <br>3.

<DESC><p>Synopsis: The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) is soliciting responses through this Third Request for Information (RFI) for work on a planned competitive acquisition entitled Test Mission Advisory Services (TMAS), a follow-on to the Aerospace Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Advisory and Assistance Services (ARDTEAS) contract which is primarily performed at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB, CA. The scope of the TMAS requirement will potentially include Test and Evaluation Assistance and Advisory Services (A&amp;AS) requirements at Eglin AFB and Arnold AFB. The AFFTC solicits responses from interested parties in regard to vendor interest. The acquisition may be set-aside for small business. The government is seeking additional information from small businesses to aid in the acquisition planning for this requirement. Small Businesses interested in this opportunity may decide to partner/team with other businesses in order to meet the requirements of the acquisition. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is set as 541712 with a size standard of 1500 employees. We are in the process of developing the acquisition strategy and responses to this RFI will aid in the finalization of the strategy but some preliminary decisions have been made. The TMAS program is expected to be a multiple award IDIQ hybrid contract that will include fixed price, cost plus fixed fee, cost reimbursable, and labor hour CLINs. Once the final acquisition strategy has been selected and approved, a draft RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps prior to the release of the formal RFP for industry comment.<br /><br />See attached file for further details</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to extend the period of performance period and increase the contract dollar value for the current Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Information Analysis Center (CBRNIAC) contract.
<p>The contract is scheduled to expire 30 April 2012. The intent is to extend the present performance period up to 24 months from 1May 2012 through 30 April 2014. If executed, the estimated value of the contract will be increased by $570M. The Government intends to negotiate with the incumbent contractor, Battelle Memorial Institute, on a sole-source basis. This extension will permit the continuation of performance of the current CBRNIAC contract while the requirement is recompeted. This is a non-commercial, Cost-Plus-Fix-Fee, Requirement, Research &amp; Development contract that was awarded on a competitive basis. This is neither a Request for Proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the Government's discretion. <br /><br />The information received by close of business 10 days from posting will be considered by the government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.</p>

<DESC>Library of Congress eDeposit Program<br />Request for information about normalized electronic serial content
<p><br />Contracting Office Address:</p>
<p>Library of Congress <br />Office of Contracts <br />101 Independence Avenue, SE <br />Washington, D.C. 20540-9411</p>
<p><br />Description</p>
<p>The Library of Congress and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) have long been interested in adding electronic publications to their collections. Since February 2010, the Library of Congress has exercised its legal authority under U.S. copyright law (17 USC 407) to issue mandatory deposit demand for files and associated metadata of electronic serials (journals, periodicals) which are published online only to be added to the Library's collections. Since that time, demands have been sent to over thirty publishers for over 100 titles. <br /><br />By using and adapting existing software systems and by building new tools, the Library of Congress has been able to receive, process, and provide control to over 200 deliveries of issues of the vast majority of these titles, receiving multiple deliveries of distinct content for some of them. For the content received, the Library has been able to provide a required basic level of access for staff that are processing and managing the deliveries.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Library of Congress is the nation's oldest federal cultural institution and serves as the research arm of Congress. It is also the largest library in the world and an unparalleled world resource. The collection of nearly 142 million items includes more than 32 million cataloged books and other print materials in 470 languages; more than 63 million manuscripts; the largest rare book collection in North America; more than 5 million maps; 14 million print and photographs; 17 million microforms; 6 million pieces of sheet music; the world's largest collection of legal materials, films, maps, sheet music and sound recordings; and a vast collection of incunabula, monographs and serials, bound newspapers, pamphlets, technical reports, and other printed material.</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) in Bethesda, Maryland, is a part of the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Founded in 1836, NLM is the world's largest biomedical library and the developer of electronic information services that deliver trillions of bytes of data to millions of users every day. NLM has nearly 12 million books, journals, manuscripts, audiovisuals, and other forms of medical information on its shelves. An important part of NLM's vast online holdings is PubMed Central, a web-based repository of biomedical journal literature providing free, unrestricted access to more than 1.5 million full-text articles.<br /><br />Goals <br /><br />The electronic serial content that the national libraries have received so far has had an extremely wide variety of packaging approaches, as was to be expected in content being provided by an equally wide variety of publishing organizations. The goal of the national libraries is to settle on a small number of standardized structural formats to maximize the ability for both institutions to preserve the digital content for current and future researchers.</p>
<p>However, the variation in types of file format, file and directory structures and naming schemes, metadata and packaging of the deliveries received to date severely restricts the ability to achieve these preservation and access goals. In order to automate the receipt and processing of this content and move it to our standard formats, processes and normalization routines would need to be developed for each publisher and in some cases each title. Given the broad scope of the content which the national libraries wish to obtain, such a scenario is not scalable, and manually processing the receipt of content for potentially thousands of electronic serials cannot be sustained. The national libraries need digital content delivered in a small, manageable number of file formats, metadata formats and packaging conventions, preserving the intellectual content of journals independent of the form in which that content was originally delivered.</p>
<p>Given that there are as yet insufficient agreed-upon - and widely implemented - standards for such data exchange within the publishing industry, the purpose of this RFI is to obtain information from interested parties, including the vendor community, about potential solutions to the problems facing the Library of Congress in receiving copyright mandatory deposits of electronic serials content in a small number of preferred digital formats.</p>
<p>The goal is to gather information on existing capabilities in order to leverage those business processes and streams for the libraries' purposes; this is not a request to develop new capabilities for the national libraries. However, to the extent that new capabilities are under development and may be relevant to this request the libraries seek this information as well. Examples of the types of organizations that might provide such services include journal article aggregating services, abstracting and indexing services, and electronic journal archiving services.</p>
<p>Products and Services</p>
<p>The national libraries are looking to limit the streams of incoming electronic serial content to a small number of widely-adopted digital formats, in order to minimize customized processing on receipt, to facilitate digital preservation, and to enable efficient ingest into the libraries' respective digital repository and researcher-access systems. Therefore, we are interested in gathering information from organizations that currently:</p>
<p>&bull; receive electronic serial content - articles as well as front and back matter: tables of contents, article abstracts, lists of editorial boards, etc. - from publishers or other sources in a variety of formats and structures. Article files will include additional files such as figures, images, multimedia and supplemental data files.<br />&bull; have established procedures for performing additional functions such as handling article versioning, editing/updating/correcting content due to errata, determining when full content (files) is provided, ensuring that content is complete at the article level, the issue level and the journal level.<br />&bull; convert (normalize) that content into one or more standardized formats, preferably a structured XML container such as the Journal Archiving Tag Suite (JATS) from the NLM (soon to be standardized as NISO Z39.96).<br />&bull; parse and/or extract any accompanying metadata from the above content and likewise store it in a standard XML metadata structure. Examples of this metadata include journal title, ISSN, publisher, frequency of publication, issue and/or other part information (enumeration, chronology, etc.), article-level metadata including article title, author(s), subject/keyword terms, abstracts, tables of contents, etc.</p>
<p>The national libraries are looking to streamline processing of incoming digital content for their collections, and are interested in gathering information from organizations that can:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide to the libraries the normalized content and metadata in either industry-standard packaging structures (file and directory naming, "zip", "tar" or other compression/packaging formats, etc.), or in formats prescribed by the libraries ("bag-it", etc.)<br />&bull; Provide the content via secure transfer methods (secure FTP, etc.)<br />&bull; Provide the content on a mutually-agreeable schedule, preferably an existing schedule for distribution of the content to other publishing partners.</p>
<p>We ask organizations that can provide such services to describe their overall operation; the formats of the materials they receive; the format(s) to which they convert (normalize) the content; the approximate size of the operation - number of content sources (publishers, etc.) supported, number of titles/articles converted, number of distribution partners, etc.; methods (if any) for distribution of the normalized content, etc. (Respondents do not need to reveal any proprietary information about the details of their processes or software.)</p>
<p>In addition to information about normalizing electronic journal content, we are interested in hearing from organizations that are already, or planning to, perform the above functions on other textual works besides electronic serials, such as electronic books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Business models</p>
<p>The national libraries are interested in the economic sustainability of their digital acquisitions programs, and are interested in having organizations describe their current business models. That is, are the services provided on a for-profit or not-for-profit basis? Do the cost recovery structures lean more on the creators of the content, or the recipients? Are the services provided on a per title basis, a size basis (per megabyte/gigabyte, etc.), or some other model?</p>
<p>Informational Meeting Day</p>
<p>Approximately 30 days after the issuance of this RFI, the Library of Congress will be conducting an informational meeting at its headquarters in Washington D.C. The meeting is open to any interested vendor who has products or services that are in direct support of the expectations identified in this RFI. Space is limited to 40 people and pre-registration is required. Vendors will be allowed no more than (3) three representatives for the entire company.

<DESC><p>Human influenza pandemics continue to be a public health concern. Four human influenza pandemics have occurred in the past century. BARDA has recently completed the preparation and response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus. The WHO estimates approximately 59% case fatality of the currently circulating H5N1 avian influenza virus. At this time it is uncertain which influenza virus variant will cause the next pandemic. <br /><br />The BARDA Strategic Plan 2011-2016 outlines the approach to enhance national MCM preparedness and response. BARDA plans to continue the programs for the development and procurement of MCM for pandemic influenza preparedness and response. <br /><br />To accomplish this goal, BARDA intends to publish a Request for Proposals for the supply of the following items and/or services: pre-pandemic master/working virus seeds; pre-pandemic and pandemic pilot, clinical and commercial bulk vaccines and adjuvants; storage and stability studies of vaccines and adjuvants; formulation-fill-finish of vaccine and adjuvants; preclinical and clinical studies with pre-pandemic and pandemic vaccine; international shipping; storage services and stability program for vaccine and adjuvants, (bulk and final containers) from current contracts when applicable; and disposal of vaccine bulk and final containers. <br /><br />The Department of Health and Human Services through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to companies that meet the following mandatory criteria: <br /><br />The offeror shall produce vaccines against influenza and influenza strains with pandemic potential; shall demonstrate a successful experience in the manufacturing of influenza vaccine by: <br />&bull; Holding a US influenza vaccine license OR <br />&bull; Have developed an influenza vaccine as evidenced by: <br />o A complete final Phase 3 clinical study report AND <br />o A documented BLA in preparation. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of up to five (5) years or sixty (60) months with a potential for two (2) one (1) year option periods. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available electronically through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (www.fbo.gov) on or about February 14, 2012, with proposals being due on April 20, 2012.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this website (www.fbo.gov) for the release of the solicitation as well as any amendments to the solicitation. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. All responses and/or inquiries concerning this requirement MUST be identified with the RFP number, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the primary and/or secondary point of contact&nbsp;identified in this notice.</p>

These states are particularly challenged by the persistent HIV/AIDS epidemic; trade liberalization creating the need to operate in highly competitive open markets; adverse effects of a changing global climate; increased international drug trafficking and an alarming rise in youth violent crime. Added to this menu of mounting issues, the sub-region has been on the receiving end of the global recession, which has caused painful economic contraction reducing government revenues and spending, business profits, employment and personal incomes. The region's vulnerability to multiple forms of natural disasters places further stress on these fragile economies and exposes their populations to grave physical risk. </span></p>

This development assistance strategy comprises four pillars - combating HIV/AIDS, pursuing economic growth through creating economic opportunities for youth, addressing deficiencies in rule of law and juvenile justice, and assisting the region to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. This assistance is focused on the six independent states of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)&nbsp;and Barbados, with additional Caribbean Regional Partnership Framework HIV/AIDS and Caribbean Basin Security Initiative activities carried out in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and in Guyana as that USAID Mission closes during 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The maintenance dredging for the Stockton and Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channels (DWSC) is conducted on an annual basis. The Sacramento DWSC is contained within the confines of the Sacramento River and the man-made portion of the ship channel. The Stockton DWSC follows the San Joaquin River. Due to natural sediment load moving down through these rivers, shoals develop which compromise the authorized depths of both ship channels. These shoals cause draft restrictions which increase the cost and safety for the shipping industry. Historically, approximately 200,000 to 400,000 cubic yards of shoaled material has been dredged annually. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is authorized by Congress to maintain both shipping channels to their authorized depths. Due to endangered species, the fisheries window for maintenance dredging is Aug 1 through Nov 30. After the winter storm run-off, the USACE conducts bathymetric surveys used to determine the shoaling that has developed. The USACE also develops the Notice of Intent (NOI) which is presented the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB). The NOI is used by the CVRWQCB to issue the Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification in the form a Notice of Applicability (NOA). <br /><br />This solicitation will be for a 3 year Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a maximum capacity of $10M per year for a total contract capacity of $30M. The estimated dredge quantities for the Task Orders will be developed from the NOA and bathymetric surveys. The pricing for Task Orders will be based on the individual pricing schedule set for each year of the contract. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Acquisition Information:<br /><br />THIS ACQUISITION IS PROCEEDING AS A UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE, INVITATION FOR BID (IFB). <br /><br />Minimum Guarantee of $20,000.00, Not-to-Exceed Value is $10,000,000.00 per year<br /><br />Period of Performance for Construction: To be Determined per Task Order<br /><br />This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z216, SIC CODE: 1629, NAICS Code: 237990. The size standard for this code is $33,500,000.

<AWARDEE>TMI COATINGS, INC. (131548521) <br> 3291 TERMINAL DR<br> SAINT PAUL, MN 55121-1598
<DESC>The project is to provide touch up painting on multiple parts of a 100+ year-old steel bridge structure. The bridge is a transportation link for trains, cars, and pedestrians across the Mississippi River and its navigation channel. Closures will have to be coordinated and planned well in advance, as most of the work is on the swing span itself. The areas in need of touchup painting shall, in places, require prepping the steel surface down to near white metal blast condition, but in others shall only require an over coat to be applied (depending upon the existing coating system's condition as tested by the contractor). Due to the style of the bridge, there are intricate pieces of steel joined together creating multiple faces to be painted in each work area. Item to be painted are not to be disassembled. Lead paint is not anticipated on the bridge

<DESC>NASA Airspace System Program (ASP) research is directly addressing the fundamentalresearch needs of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) in partnershipwith the member agencies of the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO).  NextGenrepresents a substantial and long-term change in the management and operation of theUnited States National Air Transportation System (NAS). The NAS includes all airports andairspace under the authority of the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA).ASP supports this effort through the NextGen Concepts and Technology Development (CTD)Project and the NextGen Systems Analysis, Integration and Evaluation (SAIE) Project. Thetasks defined for this effort support the Systems and Portfolio Analysis (SPA) elementwithin SAIE. SPA conducts system studies on integrated ASP concepts to identify thesystem benefits or impacts. The behavior of air carriers in the NAS needs to beunderstood to allow accurate modeling. With this understanding of air carrier behavior,incentives need to be designed to balance the individual objectives of the participantsand the overall best operation of the NAS. The understanding of air carrier behaviorneeds to be formalized in models and integrated in overall system analysis and designmethods.The scope of this effort is to enable quantified assessments of NextGen concepts andtechnologies, taking into account air carrier behavior, across all areas of interestincluding but not limited to safety, risk, environmental impacts and economics. Specifically, modeling of the behavior of air carriers is required to understand thedecision-making logic of air carriers, and the consequences of their decisions to theNAS. This understanding of consequences allows the development of appropriate incentivesto achieve desired policy outcomes balanced with the individual objectives of the aircarriers.The work is fundamental research into deriving the functional relationship between thecontrollable variables of the NAS and the comprehensive set of utilities (objectives andconstraints) in the NAS, including the utilities of the participants, such as passengerand cargo carriers, pilots, air traffic controllers, the FAA, and the overall NASutilities. The research must take into account conjectured behavior utilities ofautonomous vehicles including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

The new package will perform the same functionality as the current IFMIS cluster package, which is to provide a high availability (HA)/Disaster Recovery (DR) environment for the IFMIS application servers. In order to standup the new package, the following steps must occur:<br /><br />a. The new database requires the same functionality as the current IFMIS database which is to provide a high&nbsp;availability (HA)/Disaster Recovery (DR) environment via a continental cluster.<br />b. Implementation and documentation of Failover policies.<br />c. Configuration of SF269 standby database on DNITH1.<br />d. Configuration of SF269 primary database on MWITH6.<br />e. Configuration of failover scripts&nbsp;&amp; policies from MWITH6 to DNITH1.<br /><br />These activities are beyond the knowledge and skill level of the current system administration team and require a qualified HP installation team in order to provide a stable cluster environment to support high tempo operations with minimal service interruptions. <br /><br />Period of Performance: To last three weeks from date of award
