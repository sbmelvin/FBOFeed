<DESC>The CARVII confocal system is a new technology that provides the imaging and resolution of true laser confocal systems but at half the price. The CARVII confocal used in conjunction with the Zeiss AxioObserver will provide an excellent general purpose light microscope and spinning disk confocal imaging system. It will provide imaging on fixed tissue as well as fresh tissue. It uses a full spectrum white light source capable of exciting a wide range of fluorophores from 350nm to 700nm (other systems require purchase of additional lasers to accomplish this).  This illumination is more than sufficient for imaging in wide field as well as in the confocal mode.  CARVII offers minimized phototoxicity to cells and minimized photobleaching of fluorophores. Observation of live cells for hours is possible. This equipment will be used on command approved research protocols S-05-011, S06-053 and S-06-1

The Period of Performance shall be from June 1, 2007 or the date of award, whichever is later, for twelve (12) months.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm ET on May 25, 2007 to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors? responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email the aforementioned individual to insure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), http://www.bpn.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) http://orca.bpn.gov. Please reference NCI-70059-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This Announcement has been modified. Part I, Section B, Numbers 2b, 5b, and 8b have been modified to reflect 04 hours of Recurrent Pilot Simulator Training. The corrected copy has been posted or call Holly Crothers at 405-954-8867 for a corrected copy. The contractor is to provide initial and recurrent ground school, simulator and flight training to commercial/instrument pilot standards for FAA inspectors/pilots in the Bell Helicopter 222/230 aircraft.  The training hours specified in the price schedule are minimums.  If the contractor's FAA approved training program contains less time than the specified hours, the contractor shall supplement their approved program with additional ground school/flight training as necessary to meet the solicitation requirements.  The contractor may, within the limits of their approved program, delete company specific training such as employee/customer relations, filling out company forms, or other items not related to the completion of the FAA type rating or proficiency check and substitute additional solicitation required training. When responding to this solicitation, the contractor is required to submit a copy of their FAA approved training program, along with proposed supplemental additions/changes.  The copy of the approved program submitted must include a course syllabus, including proposed additions/changes, in sufficient detail to determine compliance with the minimum hourly requirements of the solicitation. Training of FAA pilot/inspectors is not to be conducted between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m., including flight  pre and post briefings.  A maximum of four hours flight instruction per day or eight hours of ground school per day per inspector class is permitted. To maintain continuity between flight training sessions, the contractor is requested to minimize the switching of flight instructors between sessions. FAA personnel do not ordinarily operate the aircraft in which they are rated on a regular basis.  Therefore, it is necessary that they receive the most complete review possible when attending recurrent training.  If the contractor's approved program allows for a partial review of systems and procedures during successive recurrent training periods, it is required that the contractor supplement their approved program to achieve a complete review for FAA pilot/inspectors during each recurrent course.   FAA personnel are usually performing other job functions prior to assignment to training and normally do not have time to devote to pre-course study.  Additionally, due to circumstances beyond the control  of the FAA or the pilot/inspector, a pilot/inspector may be assigned to training with short notice.  If the contractor's approved program requires pre-course study prior to the trainee's arrival at the contractor's training facility, the contractor is required to supplement their approved course to allow for required pre-course study to be accomplished at the contractor's facility after the pilot/inspector's arrival.  Such ground instruction must either be classroom or computer based training in accordance with the General Training Requirements of the solicitation.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 The following two questions arrived after Amendment 0001 was issued.  These questions and FAA's responses comprise the entire Amendment 0002. Question 1:  Are we to assume that the key indiviuals will work out of the William J Hughes Technical Center or can they work out of the FAA Headquarters in Washington DC? Response:  It would be feasible for the Senior Engineer to be offsite for part of the time when doing documentation reviews, engineering studies etc, but may need to be onsite at times for testbed development / testing efforts / meetings etc.  The other key categories must be onsite full time to support the equipment in our labs and to conduct testing. The FAA does not plan to provide Headquarters' office space for the onsite work on this contract.  The FAA onsite location is the William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405. Question 2:  Considering the wide gap in a $4.5M size standard and 1500 employees and in order to obtain the widest possible participation, would you please consider expanding the possible NAICS codes be expanded to include 541990, All Other Professional Services - $6.5M or 541690, Other Scientific & Technical Consulting Services - $6.5M. This would provide more competition especially since the incumbent contract is held by a large company. Response:  The FAA is confident that the work required will ultimately fall into one of the two NAICs codes listed in the original announcement.                        End of Amendment 0002 ____________________________________________________________________________ Amendment 0001 is attached.   The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical center (WJHTC) has a potential requirement for Air-to-Ground and Telecommunications Support Services, as described in attached draft Statement of Work.  The work contemplated was previously procured using the General Services Administration's Information Technology schedule and was awarded to Titan Systems Corporation.  The intent of this announcement is to determine if there are interested and capable Small Businesses.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  The results of the survey will aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside the requirement for small businesses when the formal screening information request (SIR) for offers is prepared. The work contemplated includes key personnel in each of the following North American Industry Code Standard (NAICS):   NAICS 		Description			Size Standard 541330	Engineering Services			$4.5 million 517110	Wired Telecommunications Carriers 	1500 employees Small businesses with the requisite capabilities are welcomed to submit responses if they qualify under either NAICS size standard.   The FAA estimates that there will be a need for Air-to-Ground and Telecommunications Support Services for the next 5 years and anticipates awarding a single, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract on or about August 1, 2007.  Interested companies are required to provide: â€¢	Completed Business Declaration Form, Attached â€¢	Submit an original and three copies of the following: 1.  Staffing Plan - no more than 3 pages How will your firm be able to provide qualified personnel to fill the Senior Engineer, Systems Engineer, Telecommunications Networking Specialist I & II and the Project Management Support/Technical Writer positions by the proposed August 1, 2007 contract start date?  Will contractor personnel be supplied by your firm's currently-available employees or via sub-contractor arrangements?  If both, please describe the details of your approach to meeting the staffing requirements for the initial delivery order.   Describe how your firm plans to backfill positions with qualified personnel in the event that a position is vacated or when a new program is added and other positions, such as the Senior Software Specialist, Ground Communication Specialist I or II, Technician, Information Systems Security Specialist, Engineer I or Engineer II  are required?   One of the Key Personnel, the Systems Engineer, must have a top-secret clearance and the ability to obtain a special Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Access?

The experience should include the name of the Government agency or commercial entity for which the work was performed, start and end date of work, dollar value, point of contact and phone number for customer organization familiar with the technical performance of your work on the project. 3.  Contract transition/subcontractor management plan A one-page description of how your company will be able to accomplish the work and transition of existing contract in a seamless manner.  If you plan to work with a teaming partner or sub-contractor, also include a description of how you will manage their work.

<DESC>MODIFICATION - NOTIFICATION TO THE FOLLOWING CHANGE:   

The purpose of this modification is to correct an error.  The original special notice synopsis for this requirement should have stated that this effort was for a base year of 12 months plus 4 option periods of 12 months each.  The Government?s intent was to always include a base period and 4 options.  However, this information was inadvertently omitted from the previous synopsis.  The Government still has a valid need for the continuation of services currently being provided by the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) on a sole source basis.  Therefore, it is the Government?s intent to modify the existing contract (200-2006-19121) with AAPCC to add the four option periods.  

AAPCC is uniquely qualified to perform this work because they are the association of the 63 poison control centers in the United States.  It is the only organization that has access to data collected in a standardized manner by the poison control centers.  This data is uploaded to a centralized database located at AAPCC headquarters every 4-10 minutes.  No other organization has access to data about poisonings that occur in the United States, maintains the data in a single database, and has the ability to review specific variables as needed.    

Interested parties may submit a statement of qualifications and experience relevant to this requirement, which if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.  Inquires must be received by 21 May 2007 at 4:00PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Responses may be E-mailed to Vallerie Redd at gfj3@cdc.gov.  Questions regarding this proposed acquisition may be directed to Vallerie Redd at (770) 488-2845. 
or national aberration detection.  
7. Facilitate evaluation activity at local poison control centers to evaluate the quality of the data that is uploaded to the national poisoning data system by comparing the coded variables (available at a national level) to the more comprehensive text data that is entered and stored at the local level.  PCCs will pull records of past calls and use fellow and/or local staff to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the codes entered into the national data system to capture information recorded in the text fields.
8. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to test the ability of the system to detect a staged chemical event.  PCCs to conduct a “mock event” whereby poisoning data is planted in those PCC’s data and sent to AAPCC’s national poisoning data system.  The evaluation will determine the sensitivity of the national poisoning data system to detect the “event”.
9. Facilitate a survey of PCC and other public health officials about their understanding of the role and function of clinical toxicology in the public health setting.  
10. Provide one staff person at each poison control center access to training and/or training materials about the new national poisoning data system.

Reporting Schedule – At 4, 8 and 12 months after contract award, the Contractor shall provide progress report describing expenditures to date, number and nature of aberrations, number of outbreaks or real events detected, resolution of aberrations, and upgrades to the hardware and software.

The Statutory Authorities permitting other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.     Interested parties may submit a statement of qualifications and experience which, if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.     Inquires must be received by June 30, 2006, at 4:00PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Responses may be E-mailed to Charlene Allison at fkk1@cdc.gov.  Questions regarding this proposed acquisition may be directed to Charlene Allison, Contract Officer, 770-488-2841.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source contract with the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), 3201 New Mexico Avenue, Suite 330, Washington, DC 20016.  AAPCC is the association of the 63 poison control centers in the United States and as such receives data concerning 2.2 million poison exposures annually from U.S. poison control centers.  This poisoning data is updated every 4-10 minutes, 24 hours a day.  Toxicologists, epidemiologists, and statisticians at AAPCC and CDC (NCEH/EHHE/HSB) have developed and continually modify categories of information collected by the national poisonings data system to analyze for aberration detection.

The Contractor, as an independent agent and not as an agent of the government, shall provide CDC with data about poisonings from the Poison Control Centers (PCCs) (i.e., call volume, clinical effect data, and specific substance data) for use in CDC toxicosurveillance and notification of public health officials of aberrations.  The Contractor shall provide real-time toxicosurveillance data in a manner that meets or exceeds CDC security requirements established by the Public Health Information Network (PHIN).  The software and hardware used to collect national poisonings data will be flexible enough to eventually allow for the uploading of, or ensure the accuracy of coding for, text fields from the PCC record; is compatible with the four data entry platforms currently being used by the PCCs; and can be modified as CDC’s data needs grow and change.  The system and the data collected will be continually reviewed and evaluated collaboratively by the Contractor and CDC toxicology and surveillance experts so that data quality and utility is improved.  All work performed under this contract is done so under guidelines and limitations set forth in the executed licensing agreement(s).  So that progress can be monitored, the Contractor shall provide quarterly reports to CDC.  Reports will describe the progress of each activity, as well as the costs associated with that progress.

Technical Requirements  
The Contractor shall:
1. Complete initial rebuild of national poisoning data system, ensuring CDC access to data, compliance with CDC security and technology specifications, and system redundancies to protect the data.  
2. Continue to review 10-20 aberrations detected in the regularly monitored exposure data and provide subject matter expertise interpretation and resolution of the aberration as appropriate.  This activity is the daily operation and purpose of the national poisoning data system for CDC.
3. Expand the current capability of national poisoning data so it can be utilized by GIS software applications and will purchase the software to allow creation of visual display of national poisoning data.
4. Develop a database and track the details about alerts issued by the national poisoning data system, including origin, follow-up actions, contacts, and resolution.  
5. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to expand their surveillance capabilities and improve their ability to detect aberrations at the local level.  The proposed activity will replicate and expand the national aberrancy detection algorithms at 3 local PCCs; the evaluation will compare detection of anomalies at the local level versus the national level.
6. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to: a) develop a database to track the details (e.g., origin, follow-up actions, contacts, resolution) about aberrations that their local detection systems identify; and b) compare their anomalies with PCC surveillance to determine whether there is any added public health benefit in conducting surveillance on the local level in addition to national surveillance.   The PCC tracking databases will be compared for sensitivity and specificity to the databases developed by AAPCC f

<DESC>In addition to information that has been posted in Modification 1, 2, and 3 Modification 4 will accomplish these objectives:

1)	Change the Response Due Date to June 15, 2007 from April 30, 2007 and
2)	Present the pre-qualification criteria that is necessary to compete for the Automated Letter Movement System (ALMS)


Automated Letter Movement System - Prequalification

The United States Postal Service is seeking potential sources for an automated letter movement system.  This includes the mechanical transport, control electronics and software required to move letter mail between existing ?islands? of automation.  The USPS does not wish to limit potential suppliers on the approaches that they propose to implement an automated letter movement system.  Therefore, the USPS is intentionally providing minimal requirements for an automated letter movement system.

The USPS plans to automate the process of moving letter mail from the automation equipment that is used to enter letter mail into the USPS automation process to the automation equipment that is used to sort letter mail.  The new system will replace the current manual processes of removing mail from accept stackers on the ?input? automation; moving letter mail to ?output? automation; and feeding it into the ?output? automation.  

The USPS will work with the selected supplier(s) to define interface specification between the existing letter automation and the automated letter movement system.  The selected supplier(s) shall be responsible for development, installation, test support, and removal of all components of the automated letter movement system, with the exception of any changes to existing USPS equipment to comply with the jointly developed interface specification.  The USPS will be responsible for making the necessary changes to the existing automation to comply with that interface specification.  


Implementation Strategy

Equipment Requirements

The automated letter movement system shall consist of all components that are required to implement the solution proposed by the supplier.  The system is to be developed, manufactured, deployed and maintained using industry best practices in technology and supply management.  The proof of concept test automated letter movement system shall move mail from two prototype Advanced Facer Canceller System 200 (AFCS 200) machines to either one or two Delivery Bar Code Sorters (DBCS) machines.  The supplier shall specify the number of DBCS machines to fully demonstrate its concept for an automated letter movement system.

Deployment
The supplier shall be responsible for installation of the system to be tested, maintenance of the system during testing, and removal of the system after the test is complete.  The planned test site is the USPS processing facility in Santa Ana, CA.  Installation shall occur such that there is minimal disruption to normal postal plant operations.  The installation and removal of the test system shall not cause undue operational interference or loss of processing capability.  The supplier shall be responsible for developing an installation and removal plan that will be approved by the Postal Service.  


Evaluation Criteria

The following evaluation criteria will be used to assist evaluators in determining which suppliers best demonstrate the capability and resources to successfully fulfill the USPS requirements.  

The USPS intends to select only those suppliers that have the demonstrated capability and resources to supply both an engineering prototype automated letter movement system for test and potential future production systems; the associated services required; and in the time frame necessary.  This selection process will be performed in compliance with the guidelines contained in the USPS Supplying Principles and Practices Manual.

Suppliers will be evaluated in the following areas:

Category I.  Technical Capability
?	Factor A ? System Concept - The USPS will evaluate the Supplier?s concept for an automated letter movement system.  Some of the factors that will be included in the evaluation of the supplier?s concept are technical feasibility; system complexity; amount of exiting (proven) technology used; functional risk; and performance risk.  The USPS will be evaluating how the Supplier?s concept will perform both under normal operating conditions and exception conditions.  Exception conditions would include conditions such as when one of the pieces of equipment ?connected? to the automated letter movement system stops due to a jam or malfunction condition.
?	Factor B - Technical Capability ? The USPS will evaluate the Supplier?s ability to design, develop, and integrate the hardware and software technology solution proposed by the Supplier as to whether it is comprehensive enough to provide some assurance of success.    

Category II.  Ability to Meet Delivery Requirements
?	Factor A - Manufacturing and Production Capability ? The USPS will evaluate the supplier?s ability to meet the production schedules, adjust production facilities to satisfy tight lead times, and provide equipment that, when installed, operates effectively.   The USPS will also evaluate the supplier?s quality assurance methods, standards, and processes in place to ensure a quality end-product.

?	Factor B - Hardware and Software Maintenance and Support ? The USPS will evaluate the Supplier?s past performance on their ability to support and maintain relevant hardware and software packages, including all modifications made or proposed to be made to meet Postal Service requirements in software development, documentation, training, depot repair, and help desk services.  

?	Factor C ?Installation Capability ? The USPS will evaluate the supplier?s site survey, installation, and deployment capabilities to ensure that it can effectively install the proposed system in USPS locations to meet proposed requirements.  

?	Factor D - Management Capability ? The USPS will evaluate the ability of the Supplier to manage the project effectively throughout the contract term; the supplier?s financial capabilities to manage a project of this size and magnitude; and the overall corporate financial history and commitment for company growth and financial stability.
	
?	Factor E - Past Performance and Experience ? the USPS will evaluate the Supplier?s management experience on like contracts of significant size and magnitude.  The USPS will evaluate the suppliers? corporate history and commitment, including the proven ability to design, manufacture, and maintain automation equipment, as well as the ability to meet delivery schedules.  Strong preference will be given to suppliers performing contracts of similar scope and nature with demonstrably superior performance.  Knowledge of postal operations will be considered.

Weights for Evaluation Factors

Category I, Technical Capability has a greater weight than Category II, Ability to Meet Delivery Requirements. Moreover, in Category I Factor A ? System Concept is twice as important as Factor B - Technical Capability.
Category II, Ability to Meet Delivery Requirements has, sub-factors denoted by the capital letter (e.g. ?A?, ?B?, ?C?) within each criterion are listed in descending order of importance. A is more important than B and B is more important than C and so on.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 13: SALMEC-07-R-0030 is amended as follows: 

1) FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (DEC 1996) is added to Section I Contract Clauses of the solicitation by reference. 

2) If the offerors standard accounting practices require the burdening of allowable travel costs with G & A and any other type of fees, the offeror is required to take the following steps so that the Government may be able to evaluate the offerors cost proposal accurately and fairly.

a.	The offeror must list clearly in their price proposal (and highlight in Yellow) which travel costs they are proposing to burden with G & A and any other type of fees;
 
b.	The offeror must list clearly in their price proposal (and highlight in Yellow) the G & A rate they are proposing for each travel CLIN. 

    The offeror'a proposed G & A (for each reimbursable travel CLIN for the Base Year and each Option Year) rate will be used to burden the Government?s estimated costs for each travel CLIN for that offerors price proposal. The offeror(s) proposed price will be adjusted by the Government accordingly for evaluation of the price proposals for contract award.

For instance, if the Government has estimated $350,000.00 for travel for the Base Year (this is the figure that is in Section B of the proposal for the Base Year), and the interested offeror  says that he wants to charge 15% G & A on travel for the Base Year, the Government will adjust the listed estimated travel cost by 15% in that offerors proposal. Thus, the estimated travel CLIN in that offeror?s proposal would be adjusted to $402,500.00 (i.e. 15%) for the Base Year as opposed to the Governments estimated $350,000.00 which will be listed in the other offerors proposals who are rolling the G & A into each labor categorys hourly rate. This will be done for each reimbursable travel CLIN the offeror plans to charge G & A on. 

Offerors planning to do this SHALL NOT adjust the Governments estimated reimbursable amounts but instead clearly type the G & A percentage (they plan to charge the Government) in the right margin next to the reimbursable CLINS. Offerors shall also prepare a memorandum that will be placed on top of the first six (6) pages of the solicitation for each of the six proposals submitted explaining which reimbursable CLINS they will charge G & A (and any other fees) to and the percentage for the Base Year and each Option Year.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE REQUESTING INFORMATION ONLY.  This is not a solicitation.  The Government will not pay for any preparation costs or for information submitted.  This is strictly to compile a potential sources list and possibly result in a future request for proposal.  The Smithsonian Institution, Office of Contracting, seeks information on availability of capable sources for a construction project.   The requirement is to build a secondary fire exit stairs at the Control Building located at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), Submillimeter Array (SMA), located  13,400 ft above sea level at the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  1.  The Control building which houses equipment to control the antenna arrays, lacks a secondary exit from the upper floor level, as required by current codes.  2.  The Control Building is a two-story, steel modular building (approx. 3200 sq. ft.) with plywood floors.   3.  Construction Details:  3.1.    3/4 hr rated steel exit door with a 3/4 hr. fire-rated insulated double-glazing (half-glazed) or wire glass, to maintain optimal natural lighting for the lounge/kitchen area.  3.2.  Treads and landings ensure natural elimination of snow-buildup.  3.3.  Window, with fire glass or wired glass, with insulated double-glazing, sized within the existing structural framing -- minimum fire rating of glass: 3/4 hr.  3.4.  Steel stair with steel guardrails and handrails.  3.5.  Concrete landing at ground level to provide proper exit of personnel to area near building entrance.  3.6.  Ground that will be affected by construction of this structure shall be returned to natural volcanic rock appearance, similar to adjacent areas.  3.7.  The Control Building will be in use during construction activities for this project.  4.  Structural:  4.1.  Structure is independent of the steel structure of the existing Control Building.  This will minimize demolition of existing insulated wall panels at new door opening.  4.2.  Guardrails and handrails have been designed to meet OSHA minimum requirements.  4.3.  Reinforced concrete foundations, adjacent to but independent of the existing building foundations.  5.  Electrical  5.1.  Illuminated LED exit sign at interior of new exit door.   5.2.  Five (5) exterior emergency light fixtures to illuminate the stair.  Light fixtures are compact, with red lamps, and activated by motion sensors with a timed duration.  5.3.  Existing interior gypsum board wall is open above the existing suspended acoustic ceiling tiles to install J-boxes for exit sign and exterior lighting fixtures.  6.  Drawings, specifications, and other documents are not available.  7.  Only small business sources in Hawaii will be considered.  

Vendors should identify clear and convincing evidence of capabilities to perform the project.  Please submit the following:  1.  Cover Page identifying company information to include DUNS number, 2.  Past Performance:  Summary of three previous projects of similar size, scope, and complexity within the last two years and current Points of Contact with phone numbers.  Include whether the performance was as a prime or subcontractor,  3.  Resumes of three key personnel, 4.  Proof of insurance and bonding capabilities which can be a current certificate of insurance, and 5.  Brief summary of plan of accomplishment.    Please provide electronic responses to WattsL@si.edu and to BrownEm@si.edu by May 18, 2007, 11:00 am, EST.

<SOLNBR>FA8635-07-C-6000
<RESPDATE>061207
<ARCHDATE>07172007
<CONTACT>Linda Loftis, 937-904-5843
<DESC>Description The 642 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS) A-10 Aircraft Program is  conducting a market survey for the continuation of Operational Flight  Program (OFP) development and integration into the A-10 fleet in  conjunction with the on-going Precision Engagement (PE) modification,  currently with Lockheed-Martin Systems Integration (LMSI), Owego NY.  The  642 AESS anticipates a 4-year contract with multiple pricing arrangements. The A-10 is a single place, pressurized, low wing and tail aircraft  powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100A turbo-fan engines, capable of  worldwide deployment and operation from austere bases with minimal support  equipment.     Major aircraft modification programs, such as Integrated  Flight and Fire Control Computer (IFFCC) and PE are currently in progress.  The IFFCC began fielding in 2003 and the PE in 2006.  These programs will  provide the A/OA 10 with new combat capabilities to employ a variety of  smart weapons plus improved situational awareness, and enhanced target  identification and designation capability. The A-10 OFP contract will include requirements for software development  and integration, systems engineering, system/sub-system integration,  program integration, program management, configuration management and  configuration status accounting, development and preparation of source  data for technical orders / data / publications, support equipment,  procurement, and OFP installation and flight test support.  Development  and integration of OFP modifications into the A-10 fleet has already begun  under the existing OO-ALC and ASC contracts.  The A-10 OFP contract will  provide the follow-on effort to the on-going PE efforts with a Base  contract and two options. At a minimum, the A-10 OFP development and integration contractor will  need associate contractor agreements with the current prime contractor,  Lockheed Martin Systems Integration-Owego (LMSI), 1801 State Route 17C,  Owego, NY   13827-3998.  Some level of data rights and proprietary data  are owned by LMSI, and LMSI owns the majority of the System Integration  Laboratory (SIL) equipment and operates the SIL at the LMSI Owego  facility.  The A-10 OFP contractor will be required to use the LMSI SIL in  the performance of this contract.  The 642 AESS encourages interested  subcontractors to contact LMSI for subcontracting of work related to the  above described integration.  The LMSI point of contact is Ms. Rebecca  Shuey, 607-751-4280. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  It is a market research  tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a  large or small business in relation to North American Industrial  Classification System (NAICS) Code 336413, Other Aircraft Parts and  Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing.  All prospective contractors must be  registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be  awarded a DoD contract.  In addition, interested firms should submit  sufficient information that will permit evaluation of technical  capabilities.  Information should be pertinent and specific to A-10 OFP  development and integration and address the following:  (1) Experience:  An outline of previous or current contracts of the same type and scale as  defined in this synopsis; (2) Personnel:  Names, professional  qualifications and specific experience of personnel who may be assigned to  key positions for this contract; (3) Identification and discussion of  unique qualifications and ability to perform in the capacity of OFP  development and integration with the A/OA-10 weapon system, along with  discussion of the business relationships (and capability to establish  those relationships) envisioned in this role; (4) Any other specific and  pertinent information that would enhance our consideration and evaluation  of the information submitted.  All parties are asked to provide a contact  name, telephone number, an e-mail address and a facsimile number in their  response.  Information marked Proprietary will be protected and will not  be divulged unless mandated by existing laws.  This information should be  submitted in writing to 642 AESS/PK, 2725 C Street, Area B, Building 553,  Room 359.41, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, 45433-7424 not later  than thirty (30) days from the publication of this notice.  The points of  contacts are Linda Loftis at (937) 904-5843 and Mr. Billy Sandridge at  (937) 255-0728.  Any non-technical and/or contractual questions should be  referred to the above individuals.

<DESC>PUBLIC NOTICE:  The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality (NICHQ), 20 University Road, 7th Floor, Cambridge, MA 02138 to develop and implement a continuous quality improvement process across Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) programs that will enhance the services to children with special health care needs.

Because NICHQ has copyrighted the Medical Home SPREAD Planner tool, which is at the core of the requirement, NICHQ holds proprietary rights over specific processes and protocols developed for MCHB programs that have been piloted with the Universal Hearing Screening, Epilepsy and Medical Home Collaboratives.  The need to have these consistent processes for the nationwide promotion and evaluation of these efforts is what makes NICHQ the only responsible source without a duplication of development cost to the Government for a similar planning tool.  It would be unlikely that these costs would be recovered through competition.   Therefore, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1), NICHQ is determined to thebe the only responsible source.

A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is on file.  This announcement is for information only and is not a solicitation or request for a proposal. See note 22 of this website.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106(b) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to John Hopkins Cameroon Program (JHCP) located in Yaound?, Cameroon, in the amount of $70,311.00 to collect, process, and ship 2,500 blood samples from persons exposed to animals in Cameroon through enrollment in CDC protocol  P1200, Voluntary Study of Zoonotics Infections Among Persons Exposed to Wild Animals. CDC believes that JHCP is the only established laboratory in Central Africa that can perform this type of study because they have specific knowledge of the study and data and the location of the villages where person with novel human retroviruses were previously identified. SCOPE OF WORK: Fresh whole blood samples will be collected from persons bi-annually from participants in four rural villages. Consenting participants will have 32mls of blood drawn to test for antibodies to zoonotics inections. Blood samples will be centrifuged and separated into plasma and lymphocytes or sometimes buffy coats.

<SUBJECT>A -- Collaborations for development of lead paint test kit
<DESC>Collaborations for Development of Lead Paint Test Kit

Opportunity:
The EPA is interested in finding partners (cooperative research and development partners or licensees) to further develop, manufacture and market test kits or similar technologies for testing lead in paint as part of its proposed renovation, repair, and painting regulation.  It is anticipated that these kits would be used by renovators, repair persons, and painters to identify locations where lead-based paint is present, and reliably determine situations where appropriate preventive actions should be taken.  Because the availability of these test kits is an integral part of proposed regulation, EPA seeks to identify research and development partners or licensees as soon as possible, so that it would be commercially available by 2010.

To indicate interest:  Please reply to Kathleen Graham at graham.kathleen@epa.gov or 202-564-2678 by June 12, 2007 if you are interested in a CRADA or licensing agreement.  For more information on CRADAs please see the following website: http://www.epa.gov/osp/ftta.htm

Overview:
Under the proposed rule, published on January 10, 2006, EPA called for improved lead test kits that could be used by trained and certified home renovators to determine whether the components affected by the renovation are below the federally regulated level for lead in paint. The presence of lead above that level would require work practices aimed at reducing exposures to lead that could result from disturbed paint surfaces.  The proposed regulation requires the development of an improved test kit that can accurately and reliably identify those situations that are above the federally level for lead in paint. EPA expects that each year approximately 10-million renovations will require testing for lead levels in paint. 

The proposed renovation, repair, and painting regulation envisions that test kits will be commercially available two years after the date of publication of the final rule or, as currently anticipated, by 2010.   

Readers seeking additional information about the proposed rule should refer to the proposed regulation for renovation, repair, and painting activities published in the January 10, 2006 Federal Register, and available at http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-TOX/2006/January/Day-10/t071.pdf.

Specifications:
The EPA defines lead-based paint as any paint or other coating on a building component with either 1.0 milligrams or more of lead per square centimeter or 0.5% or more lead by weight. The term "regulated lead level" refers to either of these two threshold numbers. A manufacturer, inventor, or vendor of a test kit or similar technology may choose either one of these numbers as the regulated level for demonstration and evaluation purposes. For the final regulation on renovation, repair, and painting activities, EPA would like a test kit or similar technology that meets the following specifications to be commercially available. The specifications below are consistent with those in the proposed regulation published in the January 10, 2006 Federal Register, and provide additional detail.  Note that these specifications have been modified from earlier public notices from EPA to address a variety of comments.

Specifications: 
?	The test kit or similar technology must be able to detect lead in paint in pre-1978 housing units regardless of the type of material (wood, metal, plaster, drywall, brick, concrete, etc.) beneath the paint. 
?	Cost of approximately $2.00 per test. 
?	Test results to be available within an hour. 
?	Test kit should include quality control samples so users can make sure the test kit is working properly when the test is conducted. 
?	The test kit can be reliably used by a renovator, repair person, or painter who has completed training in the use of the test kit, and who has been certified by an EPA, state, territorial, or tribal lead program.  
?	The test kit would have negative responses below the federal threshold for lead-based paint (1.0 milligrams per square centimeter or 0.5 percent by weight) and positive responses above that threshold in most cases.  The false positive rate should be no more than 10% and the false negative rate should be no more than 5%.  Accuracy of these test kits would be evaluated by an independent third party. To maintain consistency with EPA?s recognition program for laboratory testing, lead levels between 80% and 120% of the threshold will not be used to determine false positive or false negative rates for test kits.

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Quantico, VA intends to award a Sole Source, Time and Materials contract with Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) options to L-3 Communications Corporation, 2 Federal Street, Camden, NJ 08102.  This source possesses unique knowledge and capabilities required to perform this service. The contract’s Period of Performance includes one base year and four option years extending to October 2012. The value of the contract is expected to be $20,000,000. The proposed contract action, for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302, is for services required to repair, upgrade and sustain the currently fielded Tactical Remote Sensor Systems (TRSS) System-of-Systems (SoS) providing unattended sensors, retransmission systems, and sensor monitoring systems.  TRSS is deployed and operated by Ground Sensor Platoons (GSPs) in support of the Commander’s intelligence collection effort.  Once deployed, the remote systems operate autonomously to provide continuous, unattended surveillance to distant areas of the battle space.  Remote sensors use multiple sensing modalities and radio communications methods to detect and report personnel and vehicle activity in designated areas of interest. The following are components of the SoS: 1.  TRSS Unattended Ground Sensor Set (UGSS), AN/GSQ/257 is a suite of hand emplaced sensors that operate unattended and detects activity through seismic, acoustic, infrared, and magnetic sensing technologies.  The UGSS primary sensor is the Encoder-Transmitter Unit Version II (ETU-II).  The ETU-II is a low-resolution, seismic-acoustic target classification sensor which reports targets as wheeled vehicles, tracked vehicles, or personnel.  Each UGSS includes 50 Infrared Intrusion Detector, Version II’s (IRID-II) and Magnetic Intrusion Detectors (MAGID) that can be attached to the ETU-II to provide additional target discrimination and counting capabilities.  The IRID is a temperature-sensitive transducer that reports changes in its observed field of view and reports the direction of the activity it is traveling.  The MAGID recognizes changes in its near-field magnetic environment and reports direction of movement. 2.  Day/Night Imager Version II, AN/PSQ-21 is an integrated system of cameras, radios, and image processing hardware that captures and transmits images from areas under surveillance to distant sensor monitoring systems.  Upon detection of sufficient pixel changes in the Field of View (FOV), the Imager captures an image.  The Imager then uses its radio systems to send the image to sensor monitoring sites either directly, satellite communications, or via one or more Radio Repeaters.  The Imager is remotely configurable to change operational modes, select camera controls, and change radio frequencies. 3.  Hand-Held Programmer-Monitor (HHPM), AN/PSQ-22 is a portable, programmable, dual-band, sensor emplacement tool for programming sensor equipment, monitoring sensor activity, recording sensor positions, and testing Radio Frequency (RF) communications paths between remote device sites.  Sensor imagery is displayed in the HHPM’s Tactical External Viewing Assembly (TEVA).  The TEVA may also be connected directly to the TRSS Imager when the user desires to see a camera’s field of view.  The HHPM menu provides a variety of user-selectable display preferences and test messages designed to enable Marines to perform sensor tests and direct (cabled) reconfiguration at sensor emplacement sites.  An earphone assembly and night vision filters are provided to enable operation when light and sound discipline is required.  4.  Radio Repeater Set, AN/GRQ-32 is a dual-band sensor retransmission system that enables communication between deployed sensors and monitoring sites when direct sensor-to-monitor radio line-of-site is precluded by terrain.  The Radio Repeater is remotely configurable to use various modes, filter messages, mask out problematic sensors, and change operating frequencies. The Government does not own design documentation (engineering drawings, schematics, parts lists, internal wiring diagrams, firmware (imbedded software), for these configuration items. Repair services are expected to include piece part repair of internal circuit card assemblies, firmware installation, system wiring, and external user interfaces.   The following electronic assemblies in the TRSS SoS are required to be repaired: (a)  Imager-II’s Remote Intelligent Communication Controller (RICC).  The RICC provides an integrated assembly that manages the system’s cameras, radios, and image processing subsystems.  (b) The Imager-II’s satellite communications modem is an L-band transceiver designed for use in a commercial low earth orbiting system. (c.) ETU-II Sensor Electronics Assembly (SEA).  The ETU-II SEA is a integrated radio and signature processor designed to interpret signals from seismic, acoustic, infrared, and magnetic detectors and communicate activity detected in the form of short data messages. (d) The IRID-II Detector Assembly is a dual-transducer, infrared detector designed to detect changes in its background environment and subsequently report the direction of movement that may pass in front of its field of view. (e) The EO/IR cameras are low power, ruggedized, 240 x 320 (EO) and 120 x 160 (IR) cameras d!  esigned for connection and control via the RICC. (f) The HHPM Receiver-Transmitter (RT) is an integrated radio, Global Positioning System (GPS), and display system. (g) The TEVA is a hand-held monocular used to view images at the RICC and HHPM RT. (f) The RR RT is a dual band transceiver used to retransmit sensor messages. Upgrades are anticipated to include the services necessary to evaluate recommended changes, make changes at the individual devices and SoS level, modify device firmware and hardware, perform integrated test and evaluation services, and re-baseline the SoS.  Typical upgrades include correction of system deficiencies, changes to target recognition performance, programming interfaces, communications requirements, and the implementation of changes to user interfaces. System sustainment will include production of replacement/ additional articles, and refurbishment of existing systems. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Respondents must provide level of effort and dollar estimates to acquire a full understanding of the design of the equipment. As part of the written response, a respondent must be able to prove to the Government how depot level and field problems can be identified and corrected without the aid of detailed design drawings. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A written response must include evidence of the respondent’s ability to support the described equipment. Interested parties with the capability of meeting the proposed requirements are requested to provide an E-mail to the MCSC point of contact, Ms. Vanessa Coleman, (vanessa.coleman.ctr@usmc.mil) not later than 1400 (2:00 p.m. EST) June 11, 2007 expressing interest and outlining their capabilities and qualifications to perform !  the effort. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Public Health Surveillance of Chemical and Toxin Exposures
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source contract with the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), 3201 New Mexico Avenue, Suite 330, Washington, DC 20016.  AAPCC is the association of the 63 poison control centers in the United States and as such receives data concerning 2.2 million poison exposures annually from U.S. poison control centers.  This poisoning data is updated every 4-10 minutes, 24 hours a day.  Toxicologists, epidemiologists, and statisticians at AAPCC and CDC (NCEH/EHHE/HSB) have developed and continually modify categories of information collected by the national poisonings data system to analyze for aberration detection.

The Contractor, as an independent agent and not as an agent of the government, shall provide CDC with data about poisonings from the Poison Control Centers (PCCs) (i.e., call volume, clinical effect data, and specific substance data) for use in CDC toxicosurveillance and notification of public health officials of aberrations.  The Contractor shall provide real-time toxicosurveillance data in a manner that meets or exceeds CDC security requirements established by the Public Health Information Network (PHIN).  The software and hardware used to collect national poisonings data will be flexible enough to eventually allow for the uploading of, or ensure the accuracy of coding for, text fields from the PCC record; is compatible with the four data entry platforms currently being used by the PCCs; and can be modified as CDC’s data needs grow and change.  The system and the data collected will be continually reviewed and evaluated collaboratively by the Contractor and CDC toxicology and surveillance experts so that data quality and utility is improved.  All work performed under this contract is done so under guidelines and limitations set forth in the executed licensing agreement(s).  So that progress can be monitored, the Contractor shall provide quarterly reports to CDC.  Reports will describe the progress of each activity, as well as the costs associated with that progress.

Technical Requirements – 
The Contractor shall:
1. Complete initial rebuild of national poisoning data system, ensuring CDC access to data, compliance with CDC security and technology specifications, and system redundancies to protect the data.  
2. Continue to review 10-20 aberrations detected in the regularly monitored exposure data and provide subject matter expertise interpretation and resolution of the aberration as appropriate.  This activity is the daily operation and purpose of the national poisoning data system for CDC.
3. Expand the current capability of national poisoning data so it can be utilized by GIS software applications and will purchase the software to allow creation of visual display of national poisoning data.
4. Develop a database and track the details about alerts issued by the national poisoning data system, including origin, follow-up actions, contacts, and resolution.  
5. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to expand their surveillance capabilities and improve their ability to detect aberrations at the local level.  The proposed activity will replicate and expand the national aberrancy detection algorithms at 3 local PCCs; the evaluation will compare detection of anomalies at the local level versus the national level.
6. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to: a) develop a database to track the details (e.g., origin, follow-up actions, contacts, resolution) about aberrations that their local detection systems identify; and b) compare their anomalies with PCC surveillance to determine whether there is any added public health benefit in conducting surveillance on the local level in addition to national surveillance.   The PCC tracking databases will be compared for sensitivity and specificity to the databases developed by AAPCC for national aberration detection.  
7. Facilitate evaluation activity at local poison control centers to evaluate the quality of the data that is uploaded to the national poisoning data system by comparing the coded variables (available at a national level) to the more comprehensive text data that is entered and stored at the local level.  PCCs will pull records of past calls and use fellow and/or local staff to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the codes entered into the national data system to capture information recorded in the text fields.
8. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to test the ability of the system to detect a staged chemical event.  PCCs to conduct a “mock event” whereby poisoning data is planted in those PCC’s data and sent to AAPCC’s national poisoning data system.  The evaluation will determine the sensitivity of the national poisoning data system to detect the “event”.
9. Facilitate a survey of PCC and other public health officials about their understanding of the role and function of clinical toxicology in the public health setting.  
10. Provide one staff person at each poison control center access to training and/or training materials about the new national poisoning data system.

Reporting Schedule – At 4, 8 and 12 months after contract award, the Contractor shall provide progress report describing expenditures to date, number and nature of aberrations, number of outbreaks or real events detected, resolution of aberrations, and upgrades to the hardware and software.

The Statutory Authorities permitting other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.     Interested parties may submit a statement of qualifications and experience which, if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.     Inquires must be received by July 14, 2006, at 4:00PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Responses may be E-mailed to Charlene Allison at fkk1@cdc.gov.  Questions regarding this proposed acquisition may be directed to Charlene Allison, Contract Officer, 770-488-2841.

<SUBJECT>D -- Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) 2008
<DESC>1. This announcement is for the Coalition Warrior  Interoperability Demonstration 2008 (CWID 2008) scheduled for 27 May through 20 Jun 08. Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services and Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DoD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States (U.S.) must submit Interoperability Trial (IT) proposals for CWID by 14 Sep 07. Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DoD to submit ITs. Complete details on CWID, to include references and submission instructions for ITs, are found at http://www.cwid.js.mil.
2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event enabling the COCOMs, U.S.  military services, U.S. national civil authorities and the multinational coalition community to discover and investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions which focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing Coalition, COCOM, Service, Agency (C/C/S/A) interoperability and information sharing while exploring new partnerships. U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), on behalf of the Chairman, is responsible for the oversight of the CWID program.  CWID focuses on net-centric solutions to identified C4ISR gaps that the traditional DoD acquisition process is not addressing.  Gaps are identified in the CWID objectives and reflect immediate and near term (less than 24 months) capability needs.  CWID analyzes the technical functionality, security features, and military utility of submitted IT proposals within the construct of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System.  C/S/As are highly encouraged to conduct further investigation into the tactics, techniques, and procedures using CWID as a vehicle. CWID is also an appropriate venue for spiral development, risk reduction, or validation of fielded/near-fielded commercial and/or DoD systems when appropriate to reduce fielding costs or transition timelines.
3. U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) is the host COCOM for CWID 2008 and develops the simulated operational scenario.  The scenario focuses on exercising military coalition task force (CTF) responsibilities in conjunction with U.S. Northern Command?s (USNORTHCOM) Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HS/HD) initiatives, and increasing/enhancing involvement, integration, and interoperability with allies in USEUCOM?s area of responsibility (AOR). Coalition participation remains the cornerstone of CWID and the anticipated international participants include: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO. In addition, COCOMs may invite nations, with prior Joint Staff approval, from within their respective AOR to participate as multinational task force members. USNORTHCOM will continue its CWID transformational efforts by investigating HS/HD applicable systems integration and interoperability solutions.  USNORTHCOM?s coalition partners include US and Canadian military, government and civil agencies (e.g., Department of Homeland Security, Canada Command, Public Safety Emergency Preparedness Canada).
4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for the validation of C4ISR solutions. Depending on the demonstrated capabilities and based on the criteria set forth in the CWID Additional Information document (published on the CWID website), each IT will be categorized into one of three tiers at IT selection and may receive one or more of the following assessments: Warfighter/Operator, Technical/Interoperability, and/or Information Assurance assessment.  ITs must have a sponsor and must address one or more of the objectives.  Tier I trials are ready-to-field, mature technology solutions or components of current Programs of Record (POR) or operational systems.  ITs related to current operational Command and Control (C2) systems may include test cases as defined in Interoperability Operational Test Requirements and Information Exchange Requirements.  Tier II trials are technology solutions that possess sufficient maturity to participate, but may require additional development before fielding.  Tier III trials are site demonstrations that support a CWID objective, but do not warrant a formal CWID assessment.  The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG) categorizes the ITs at selection and the CWID Joint Management Office (JMO) Assessment Working Group (AWG) and Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG) coordinate and conduct the assessments.  Results from the assessments are documented in the CWID Final Report. 
5. To be selected, each proposed IT must address one or more of the CWID objectives and sub-objectives listed in paragraph 7 and commit to provide all funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, and documentation necessary to participate at one or more execution locations.  The CWID SMG will select IT proposals on how well the IT?s proposal satisfies one or more of the objectives and sub-objectives and the need to share and exchange critical, time-sensitive information between military organizations, international coalitions and civilian agencies. The selection criteria are specified in the CWID Additional Information document.  ITs must be submitted with a DoD or government sponsor in the format outlined on the CWID web site.  
6. ITs are hosted on the Combined Federated Battle Lab Network (CFBLNET), a worldwide secure network, enabling classified, releasable data to be exchanged among the CFBLNET participants.  The CWID JMO coordinates, engineers, and supervises the network and the information domains for the worldwide venue.  The CWID hardware and software demonstrations support the overall Network Centric Warfare construct. During the CWID execution phase, IT activities will be conducted over the CFBLNET, which supports military and coalition operations while providing the infrastructure to facilitate the military?s role in providing Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). 
7. The 2008 Objectives, developed by USJFCOM, are supported by sub-objectives that reference clearly defined U.S. COCOM and coalition capability gaps and service inputs.  The objectives are linked to the USJFCOM and COCOM Integrated Priority Lists, the USJFCOM Transformation Roadmap, USJFCOM C2 Capability Portfolio Management (C2 CPM) initiative and other coalition and Joint Staff source documentation.  The objectives reflect the following recurring themes:
a.	Discovering and investigating emerging and relevant coalition information sharing      technologies,
b.	Focus on demonstrating solutions for COCOM theater capability gaps and challenges, and
c.	Enhance multi-service, multinational, and inter-agency cooperation and communication.

These process improvements facilitate post-CWID execution efforts to develop strategies aimed at responsibly bringing technology solutions to the DoD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) community for consideration.  
Scope: All multinational (to include DoD and non-DoD entities) information sharing solutions should be built on a foundation that is net-centric, secure, scalable, and bandwidth sensitive.


Objective 1
Improve Coalition and Joint C4ISR Architecture.  This objective will enhance leadership?s capability to command, control and coordinate across joint & coalition forces, government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and first responders.  Technologies will:
a.	Demonstrate cohesive C2 linkages between military, government agencies and coalition partners. 
b.	Demonstrate enhanced interoperability for NATO Response Force C2. 
c.	Demonstrate open & secure mobile C2 capabilities between communities of interest (COIs).
d.	Demonstrate communication tools that streamline decision-making and integrate with existing systems or that present entirely new solutions.
e.	Demonstrate communication tools that share Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Explosive (CBRNE) contingency information with first responders & emergency services.
f.	Demonstrate improved general Identification and Blue Force tracking capabilities,
g.	Demonstrate counter insurgency Indications and Warning tools.
h.	Demonstrate targeting tools for non-lethal weapons and corresponding Margin of Error,  
i.	Demonstrate systems to rapidly extend communications in support of Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations.
j.	Demonstrate tools to support neutralization of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
k.	Demonstrate expanded integration of open-source tools to open standards Service Oriented Architectures.
l.	Demonstrate tools to support the entire deployment process from requirements identification through force closure, including redeployment and rotational operations.
Explanation:  Improved C4ISR Architecture will aid coalition, military and civilian authorities to harness the power of their respective information environments to execute collaboratively operations even in a bandwidth-constrained environment.  Operations require an information environment that is not only scaleable, but one that spans multiple COIs and a variety of legacy C2 equipment.  These COIs may be populated and maintained by military or civil agencies or a combination of both and it is likely they will be bandwidth-constrained. The information exchange between these COIs must be accomplished in such a way that it inspires confidence at each activity that the information is being disseminated securely, and will only be available to the agreed upon and authorized participants.  Solutions to achieve this data dissemination, across and within COIs, should consider the use of existing, approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.    

Objective 2
Improve Information Sharing across the full Range of Civil and Military Operations. Provide the capability to share information across multiple networks of potentially different security classifications and caveats.  Emphasis should be on passing information to both U.S. controlled, coalition networks such as U.S. Central Command?s Combined enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and coalition/alliance controlled networks such as NATO?s Initial Data Transfer System, NATO Mission Wide Area Network, or releasable to Republic of Korea.  Data sharing encompasses the need for cross-domain solutions (CDS) and the assurance that information passed through CDS can be utilized by systems within all security enclaves.  The criteria used to determine whether data can be shared should also focus on existing doctrine and/or policy-based information management and implement robust information assurance capabilities to protect data.  Military and coalition operations require CDS devices to permit collaboration with first responders, NGOs, state and local governments as well as information sharing.  Technologies will:
a.	Demonstrate multi-level security & multi-domain applications that promote information sharing with planned and unanticipated mission partners.
b.	Demonstrate effective network defense applications to protect shared data.
c.	Demonstrate tools that improve utility, accuracy and timeliness of real time translation for collaboration in specific areas of responsibility. 
d.	Demonstrate complementary planning tools that support military, local law enforcement, first responders, governmental, non-governmental and coalition planning activities.
e.	Demonstrate tools to improve Request for Forces process.
f.	Demonstrate tools to improve deployment and visibility of coalition and/or interagency/Private Voluntary Organization (PVO)/NGO forces.
g.	Demonstrate use of free-ware and share-ware open standards capabilities to fully connect civilian and military planners.
Explanation: Coalition operations require an information environment that spans multiple COIs.  These COIs may be mobile, fixed or remotely located where the combination of military and/or civil agencies is likely to be affected by limited bandwidth.  Within any COI, mission success relates to the commander?s C2 ability to communicate directly with individual users or first responders who may be detached from fixed information domains.  Decision makers and/or first responders require interoperable, reliable, clear and/or secure wireless capabilities to receive and transmit critical voice, data, and video information to support the Network Centric warfare construct.  Solutions to achieve improved C2 between diverse COIs should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.  A major challenge to achieving a single integrated cross domain solution is the development of a method, strategy, and universal standard for electronically marking or labeling classification and release caveats of documents and information streams.  Since recent directives require DoD systems to use eXtensible Markup Language (XML) for data exchange, there is a need for XML-based technology that can provide a robust and secure method for marking classification and release caveats of documents and information streams.

Objective 3
Enhance Cross Domain and Multiple Security Level Information Exchange Tools.  Provide CDS and multi-lingual translation solutions that improve the commander's ability to share intelligence information products (documents, images, databases, etc.) with coalition partners, including joint and coalition forces, government agencies, NGOs and first responders. Technologies will:
a.	Demonstrate data fusion tools that support cross domain information sharing and consolidates multiple sources of information into a single reference source.
b.	Demonstrate situational awareness tools that disseminate and display time critical information for tactical forces and first responders to include defense against IEDs.
c.	Demonstrate visualization and integration tools that can simultaneously manage multiple Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance inputs.
d.	Demonstrate capabilities to enhance Maritime Domain Awareness between Federal, State and local agencies.
Explanation: Cross domain and multiple security level information exchange represent more than providing a common operational picture at the strategic or major echelon level of command.  Exchange tools must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare.  Trial proposals should be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data.  Solutions must support each nation?s disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context.  Possible information to exchange includes: directive commentary, visualization of the battlespace, friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, three dimensional imagery, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) map data, equipment status, scaleable intelligence estimates, personnel movements and other intelligence related products.   A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains.  Tools to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a necessity for successful operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.  

Objective 4
Enhance Integrated Logistics Planning and Coordination Tools.  Demonstrate the ability to access, consolidate and display logistical information to include movement, location and status of joint forces, military services, interagency, coalition, NGO, first responders as well as equipment and supplies in near real time across organizational boundaries.  Technologies will:
a.	Demonstrate secure abilities to assess & display information regarding the movement, location, & status of Coalition equipment & personnel.
b.	Demonstrate logistics data access, fusion, & integration among COIs.
c.	Demonstrate Logistic data sharing for medical and health protection services.   
d.	Demonstrate capability to exchange logistic data between government agencies, NGOs and military systems.
Explanation:  Within the information environment of coalition, military and non-military operations, the commander must have responsive and effective logistics.  Logistical data is contained within diverse logistics information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition.  Access to that data implies combining total asset visibility and information during the transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information COIs.  Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds as part of the commander?s general situation awareness.  Solutions to achieve CWID objectives should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are progressing toward operational security certification.

Objective 5
Enhance Government Agency Interoperability.   Provide solutions that improve the Combatant Commander?s ability to conduct collaborative planning with coalition partners, including joint and coalition forces, government agencies, NGOs and first responders.  Focus on enhanced collaboration and engendering a ?need to share? vice a ?need to know? culture.  Technologies will:
a.	Demonstrate data access, fusion & integration among joint forces, international, Federal and State Agencies & local law enforcement.
b.	Demonstrate the ability to distribute and track key policy and strategy documents (memorandum of agreement, memorandum of understanding, standard operating procedures, industry standard architecture) between government agencies. 
c.	Demonstrate tools to improve Information Assurance and posture between government agencies.
d.	Demonstrate a situational awareness tool that uses advanced visualization technologies capable of integrating existing systems into one common operational picture, 
e.	Demonstrate a Blue Force tracking capability for first responders.
f.	Demonstrate computer network defense capabilities to support non-military partners,
g.	Demonstrate computer network capabilities that support collaboration with the Department Homeland Security Emergency Management COI.
h.	Demonstrate multi-lingual interoperability between international agency systems and DoD, multinational systems to support Global Disaster Relief efforts.
Explanation:  Collaborative planning and dissemination of products in a bandwidth constrained environment horizontally across and vertically within COIs is an emerging issue for the warfighter, particularly as software and procedure tools become sufficiently robust to be extended from the operational to the tactical level of warfare.  The lack of robust planning and collaboration tools makes it difficult to provide the commander timely and complete information on which to develop decisions.  Communications in a CWID context is interpreted as ?coalition information sharing,? and is more than providing a radio communication or common operational picture at or between the strategic, operational, or tactical level of command.  It must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare.  Solutions must support each nation?s disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context.  Possible information exchanges include: directive commentary, friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, GIS map data, equipment status, personnel movements and other intelligence related products.   A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information-sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains.  Further, coalition operations are routinely conducted with multiple nations and organizations that are challenged with using a common language.  A tool to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.  Inherent in this requirement is the need to fuse dissimilar information and extract specific data sets while providing reliable language translations for communicating guidance to coalition partners.

<SUBJECT>R -- Solutions for Intelligence Analysis
<DESC>Solutions for Intelligence Analysis

Request for Industry
Information and Comment

1.	INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE:

	a.	In the wake of 9/11 and the evolving threat environment, defense leadership determined that a new intelligence analysis management construct was required ? one that focused on analytic effectiveness, as well as efficiency.  The Defense Intelligence Analysis Program (DIAP) was introduced in 2004 to address this need.  The goal of the DIAP is to ensure that our analysis addresses both current and emerging national security challenges as well as meeting customer needs.
	b.	The purpose of ?Solutions for Intelligence Analysis? (SIA) is to provide the DoD Intelligence Community (consisting of the DIA, Service Centers (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force) and the Combatant Commands) with a responsive, efficient and reliable means to satisfy requirements for contract intelligence analysis and related services.  ?SIA? is intended to streamline the procurement process for contract intelligence analysis services and will provide leadership with the capability to efficiently manage the use of analytic services across the DIAP.
	c.	Analysis is a highly specialized endeavor and its provision requires the capability to access a large pool of available talent with a diversity of experience, education and security clearances.  

2.	SCOPE/ASSUMPTIONS:

	a.	The DIAP program details are classified.  If you have access to the JWICs network, you can view detailed information on the DIAP at http://diateams.ne.dodiis.ic.gov/sites/DI/diap/default.aspx. The geographic scope of this effort is any DIA, Service Center, COCOM or deployed location where the delivery of intelligence analysis and related services is deemed necessary by the customer.
	b.	?SIA? is envisioned as a task-order-based, multiple-award contract with a mix of small- and big-business primes ? each with an extensive network of teaming partners and subcontractors to satisfy the community?s mission-based analytic requirements.  The Government shall reserve the right to designate selected task orders as set-asides for competition among the small business primes or to allow competition among all primes.
	c.	The total value of the ?SIA? contract vehicle is expected to be more than one-billion dollars.  Prime contractors (teams) shall be required to perform all services covered in the contract.

3.	REQUIREMENTS:

	a.	For purposes of contract scope and requirements, the DIAP shall be incorporated by reference into the ?SIA? vehicle. 
	b.	General Information About the DIAP

                                                              i.      DIAP Principles:

1.      Maintain global situational awareness while gaining depth of knowledge on a limited number of countries and enduring transnational issues that represent the greatest challenge to the U.S. national interests.

2.      Maximize resources by assigning clearly defined responsibilities to each Command, Service, and DIA.

3.      Assign analytical responsibilities based on capabilities, workforce characteristics, and Command, Service, or DIA?s mission requirements.

4.      Bring stability to the all-source analytic workforce through careful assignment of analytical responsibilities.

5.      Support the National Intelligence Priorities Framework and Strategic Planning guidance.

                                                            ii.      Organization: The DIAP consists of two Categories: Transnational Issues and Country-focused Defense Topics. The goal is to apply the appropriate level of effort against the full range of defense intelligence requirements.

1.      Transnational Issues, including but not limited to: 

a.      Global and Regional Terrorism

b.      WMD Programs & Proliferation

c.      Counterintelligence

2.      Country-Focused Defense Topics, including but not limited to:

a.      Strategy & Doctrine

b.      Joint Force Requirements & Capability

c.      Order-of-Battle

d.      Readiness & Deployment

e.      Infrastructure

	c.	POTENTIAL SERVICE CATEGORIES ? General service categories under consideration by the Government for the ?SIA? contract vehicle include, but are not limited to, the following:

                                                              i.      National-Level Intelligence Analysis

                                                            ii.      General Military Intelligence

                                                          iii.      Intelligence Planning, Management & Implementation

                                                           iv.      Support to Deployed Forces

                                                             v.      Rapid Response Crisis/War

                                                           vi.      Intelligence Analysis Training

	d.	INCIDENTALS ? The acquisition of goods/services related to intelligence analysis may be incidental to a basic service requirement.  Individual task orders may require the contractor to have specific infrastructure capabilities, such as secure compartmented information facility (SCIF) space or JWICS communications capability, essential for the performance of the task.
	e.	SECURITY ? At a minimum, all contractors shall be required to have Top Secret Facility Clearances when submitting proposals.  Specific task orders may have unique security requirements.  These requirements could include unrestricted access to the Defense Intelligence Analysis Center or other DIA approved SCIF, JWICs connectivity, and NSTS telephones.  Security requirements will be task order-specific.

3.	QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY ?

	a.	For the broad-based intelligence analysis requirements identified for this contract vehicle, what service categories would promote efficiency and responsiveness by industry?
	b.	What kind of pricing strategy, arrangement or schedule could most effectively support the provision of intelligence analysis services?
	c.	Are there any innovations with regard to security issues or clearance processing that should be considered to promote efficiency?
	d.	With regard to primes, what is the most significant criteria that would predict a company?s potential for success?
	e.	Does industry have any comment on how the ?SIA? program office should be organized or managed?
	f.	The Government proposes to apply performance-based contracting principles to this effort ? what criteria/metrics can be applied to accurately measure a contractor?s effectiveness and efficiency?

II.BACKGROUND: The Civil Rights Center (CRC) is the only entity within the Department of Labor that enforces various Federal statutes and regulations that prohibit discrimination in DOL financially assisted and conducted programs and activities. One of the CRCs primary goals is to make sure that its customers, the recipients of DOL financial assistance and DOL program agencies, have the essential information, materials, and training that will enable them to adequately comply with Federal equal opportunity and nondiscrimination laws and regulations. The CRC develops, administers, and enforces Departmental policies, practices, and procedures under Title VI and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Section 188 of WIA; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975; the Equal Pay Act; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Secretary's Order 4-2000 and related statutes and Executive Orders which prohibit discrimination in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance. III.OBJECTIVES: To make certain that the Civil Rights Center has the tools and knowledge to be able to continue to ensure nondiscrimination and equal opportunity in programs that receive Federal financial assistance from the DOL and DOL conducted programs at a time when that knowledge has been steadily depleted due to attrition, it is essential that the Center not only be able to continue to provide essential training and assistance to stakeholders in the short term, but also begin to equip current staff with the knowledge and tools that will ensure success long-term. IV.SCOPE: The nature of the work includes the following, which shall be specifically geared towards the CRCs program of ensuring nondiscrimination and equal opportunity within programs that receive financial assistance from DOL and DOL conducted programs: content development and planning for the CRCs professional development forum; complaint investigative training curriculum development and execution for the CRCs recipient community; and development and documentation of CRC procedures for complaint investigations and compliance reviews of DOL financial assistance recipients.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.
_____DESCRIPTION:
I.	GENERAL
SCOPE
This effort is to provide acquisition support services to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  Contractor personnel shall not perform inherently Governmental activities.  The Government contemplates a single award for one (1) full-time position for a four and one-half (4.5) month base period and a one (1) option, not to exceed one (1)year, for either one (1) full-time position or one (1) part-time position.
The Contracts and Procurement Section desires to procure the services of a Senior Contract Specialist for acquisition support.  The Contract Specialist shall perform support services for contract execution and administration of various types of contractual vehicles, ranging in complexity from simplified acquisition to formal source selection and contract close-outs.
OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this statement of work is to provide acquisition support services to the NLRB?s Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC.  Specifically, the Contractor shall provide experienced and qualified expertise, on a level that is equivalent to DAWIA level II or III, to provide the acquisition support and assistance identified in the statement of work.  The Contractor shall perform support services for contract execution and administration of various types of contractual vehicles, ranging in complexity from simplified acquisition to formal source selection and contract close-outs.  Work assignments shall be made with the expectation that the Contract Specialist will be able to complete assignments independently.
BACKGROUND
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.  
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION
Work for this contract will be performed at the NLRB?s 1099 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC office.  The Government expects the benefit of Government Site Rates for personnel working on a Government site, where the Government provides office space and normal business facilities for use by Contractor personnel.
Contractor personnel are expected to conform to the Government client?s normal hours of operation.  Normal hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with the core hours from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  During the base period, the Contractor is expected to work eight (8) hours a day, Monday through Friday, during the core hours.  A contractor is expected to be on-site every day, for the full eight (8) hours.  In the event the on-site contractor is unable to report, a backup contractor shall report.  In the event the on-site contractor is unable to provide a full eight (8) hours of service, in any given day, the hours must be made up prior to the end of the monthly invoice cycle.
During the option period, the Contractor is expected to work a minimum of three (3) days a week.  Hours per week will be determined at exercise of option.  Additional hours may be required during surge periods.  
The NLRB will be closed on the following Federal Holidays:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, President?s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541310 with a small business size standard of $4.5M of average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal years. 

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Physical Capital Asset Management Division (PGE), is requesting services to create Building Preservation Plan User-Guide Handbook for Center for Historic Buildings.  

BACKGROUND:  

The Building Preservation Plan (BPP) database provides comprehensive information on individual GSA historic buildings to guide appropriate maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and reinvestment. Each BPP includes a statement of significance, documentation on building alterations over time, images of current conditions, inventories of original materials, and schematic floor plans zoned to delineate the hierarchy of exterior and interior spaces as a guide to appropriate preservation and treatment. 

The original 1989 software was upgraded in 2003-2007 to operate in a web-based platform. As part of this upgrade, BPP fields not commonly used were omitted and additional fields added to provide more detailed documentation and analysis on existing conditions and treatment alternatives.  Requirements for photography were also upgraded to ensure that digital images are legible and usable. 

A major goal of the 2005 upgrade was to make the database more user friendly by eliminating alphanumeric codes, abbreviations, and terminology not commonly used by the profession, which necessitated the use of a key to enter data and read a BPP.  Another goal was to improve the screen layout and menus.  A user guide created for the original database focused on code and field definitions.  Having eliminated those user barriers, this new guide will encourage consistent terminology and aid users in making the most of this resource.

OBJECTIVES

A.  To create a user-guide handbook designed for quick reference and providing details for data entry, data retrieval, and database administration. 

B.  To develop the graphic design layout and all pre-press services, including color corrected artwork, for the printing of the user guide.

C.  Principal goals of the user guide are:

1.  Simplify data entry and ensure content consistency.

2.  Enable users to understand and fully utilize the database content as efficiently as possible.

2. Submit two (2) design samples for review.

III. Past Performance

Past performance will be evaluated based on the following:

This criterion measures the relevancy of the offeror's past experience to the requirements of this project.  Offerors shall provide a list of seven relevant projects that have like or similar requirements over the past five years. In addition, this criterion measures the quality of the offeror's past performance for similar projects as defined herein.  Quality is judged with respect to work quality, administration, cost control, cooperation, and adherence to schedule and will be evaluated through reference checks made by the Government on relevant projects, completed or in progress.  

In assessing past performance, the Government will use past and present performance data to evaluate an offeror's ability to perform the contract requirements.  The recentness and relevancy of the past performance will be critical in determining the Past Performance rating. Offerors lacking relevant and recent past performance history shall receive a neutral evaluation for this factor. 

Minimum requirements for past performance include:

1. Offeror references confirm responsiveness, quality of work, timeliness

2. Offeror work samples demonstrating relevant experience, such as development of technical guidance for historic building maintenance, repair or alteration,, or online or published instructional material and building preservation plans or preservation reports that included guidance.

IV. Price

The total evaluated price will not be rated or scored but will be evaluated for reasonableness.  In no case will a contract be awarded at an unreasonable price.  Reasonableness for the type and quality of services being provided will be determined based upon prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, the independent previous prices for the same/similar services, and the Government estimate.  Any individual item, which is unreasonable, may cause the entire proposal to be determined unreasonable and result in elimination from award consideration.

Consistent with the best value concept, technical merit and pricing will be considered together to determine how advantageous the offers are to the Government.  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price, but no specific numerical weight will be assigned to price for evaluation purposes.  A proposed award to a higher-priced, higher-scored offeror must be supported by specific supporting rationale that the technical superiority of the higher priced offer, relative to other offers in the competitive range, warrants the additional expense.

Whether or not a given point spread between two competing proposals indicates significant superiority of one proposal over another will depend on the facts and circumstances of each proposal. The determinative element is not the difference in point scores itself, but the content of the relative strengths and weaknesses synthesized to form the basis of selection.  The final evaluation report must reasonably support the conclusion that the award recommendation is rationally founded and consistent with the evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation.

Price proposals shall demonstrate:

1. Economical and efficient approach 

2. Competitive offer

SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS:  Proposals must be submitted (hard copies) to 1800 F Street, NW, Room 4338, Washington, DC  20405 or by email to Ms. Collette Scott at: collette.scott@gsa.gov.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-190 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334519 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to procure the Tecnai G2 F20 Twin microscope from FEI, 5350 NE Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, OR 97124.  This microscope would allow the lab to solve the structure of numerous proteins using helical, single particle and tomography image processing methods.  The lab would be able to solve the structure of proteins to a resolution of <10 &#506; and to examine organelles, such as the mitochondria, by cryo-tomography.  The 200 kV instrument allows thicker specimens to be examined for cryo-tomography and provides less noise in the images, increasing resolution.  Automation is necessary for acquiring tilt series in cryo-tomography and will maximize the use of the scope by recording images without personnel present (i.e., recording overnight).  The 4k x 4k CCD camera is also necessary for cryo-tomography and will eliminate the need for film.  The tecnai interface and CCD camera both are well tailored to network with numerous images processing packages.  The technical requirements: 1) 200 kV and FEG (Field Emission Gun) transmission Electron Microscope; 2) Scope to be used for low-dose cryo-tomography with Gatan side entry holder; 3) Advanced level of integrated computer control to allow automated data collection of complete tomographic tilt series of specimens.  Specifically the microscope system must be capable of automatically collecting complete tilt series of specified angular increment and angular range with minimum electron dose (?beam shift?) methodology and automatic correction of focus and specimen centering using existing protocols; 4) Specimens must be maintained stably at liquid-nitrogen temperature as well as at room temperature; 5) The microscope must be equipped with a high sensitivity CCD camera of 4k x 4k pixel format and allow direct acquisition of digital data; 6) Allow addition of 3rd party hardware (i.e. extra memory and hardware) and software (i.e. Leginon, see 8 below, Serial EM); 7) 80 degree tilt for stage; FEI Technai specific: 8) The program for the automation of the scope is compatible only to the Tecnai FEI series.  The program is called Leginon and is available from the Scripps Research Institute, National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy; 9) The specimen stage must accept Gatan Model 626 and 914 cryo holders designed for FEI/Phillips transmission microscopes or must provide equivalent functionality.   
The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation ? Commercial Items.

Description

	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a fixed price contract - commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 12.6 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the test program for commercial items found at FAR 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested. No other solicitation will be issued. This solicitation identified as RFQ 1028546 includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-16 (March 2007). The North American Industry Classification Code is 541611. It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. BACKGROUND: At the request of the FDA, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) investigated, researched, and published a report identifying the need for creating a ?Culture of Safety? within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).  One of the major recommendations proposed is to create and implement a process for leading a cultural change initiative that includes an approach for open and transparent organizational communication, a strategy to lead and impact complex decision making, and fostering an environment that is collaborative.  The Office of Translational Sciences (OTS) has taken a lead in responding to the IOM recommendations and is committed to creating a culture that reflects the ideas addressed in the IOM report.  OTS?s commitment to stimulating culture change is the underpinning of this project.  There is tremendous pressure on all organizations to create a culture that is responsive to the changes required to be successful in the 21st century.  It is clear that creating a culture of sustained change necessitates involvement of leaders, managers, and employees who perform the work of the organization.  Researchers and thought-leaders of organizational change management have witnessed and documented the common traps that prevent successful organization transformation.  Among the difficulties identified are the following: Allowing complacency, not identifying a guiding leadership coalition, underestimating the power of a unified and compelling vision, under-communicating the vision, letting obstacles get in the way, ignoring short-term wins, declaring victory prematurely, and not anchoring the changes into the organization?s culture.  Once the organization is committed to transforming the culture, and has identified individuals who can lead the change, it must then set its focus on naming the desired leadership behaviors that are necessary to sustain the culture.  Asking, ?What is our desired state?? and ?What will it look like and feel like to be there?? are compelling questions to ask.  More important, the answers will shape the culture the organization is striving to create.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One base year and two option years. QUESTION DEADLINE: All questions must be submitted via email to keith.austin@fda.hhs.gov by close of business May 21, 2007. QUTOTATIONS ARE DUE: 1:00pm EST, May 31, 2007. AWARD DATE: The anticipated award date is on or about June 18, 2007; however, all dates in this announcement are subject to change. PLEASE NOTE: In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov. You will need your Dun and Bradstreet number and banking information. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this acquisition. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/. OFFERORS: Offers must be submitted on a SF-1449 with a completed 52.213-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items-with DUNS Number Addendum, signed by an authorized representative of the offeror.

The technical quotation will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the offerors for this acquisition.  In the event that the technical evaluation reveals that two or more offerors are approximately equal in the technical ability, then cost may become a significant factor in determining award.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  Developing high impact leaders who collaborate effectively across organizational boundaries.

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1	 BACKGROUND

At the request of the FDA, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) investigated, researched, and published a report identifying the need for creating a ?Culture of Safety? within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).  One of the major recommendations proposed is to create and implement a process for leading a cultural change initiative that includes an approach for open and transparent organizational communication, a strategy to lead and impact complex decision making, and fostering an environment that is collaborative.

The Office of Translational Sciences (OTS) has taken a lead in responding to the IOM recommendations and is committed to creating a culture that reflects the ideas addressed in the IOM report.  OTS?s commitment to stimulating culture change is the underpinning of this project.

There is tremendous pressure on all organizations to create a culture that is responsive to the changes required to be successful in the 21st century.  It is clear that creating a culture of sustained change necessitates involvement of leaders, managers, and employees who perform the work of the organization.

Researchers and thought-leaders of organizational change management have witnessed and documented the common traps that prevent successful organization transformation.  Among the difficulties identified are the following: Allowing complacency, not identifying a guiding leadership coalition, underestimating the power of a unified and compelling vision, under-communicating the vision, letting obstacles get in the way, ignoring short-term wins, declaring victory prematurely, and not anchoring the changes into the organization?s culture.

Once the organization is committed to transforming the culture, and has identified individuals who can lead the change, it must then set its focus on naming the desired leadership behaviors that are necessary to sustain the culture.  Asking, ?What is our desired state?? and ?What will it look like and feel like to be there?? are compelling questions to ask.  More important, the answers will shape the culture the organization is striving to create.

1.2  OBJECTIVES

The OTS has identified several overarching behaviors and characteristics that will create and sustain a ?Culture of Safety?.  Two behaviors have been defined as mission critical.

1.	Leaders who can ?Lead with Impact?, across the organizational boundaries where they may not be the primary decision makers.
2.	Leaders who can collaborate effectively with peers, supervisors, stakeholders, and customers.

This need is focused on creating and sustaining a ?Culture of Safety?, and developing leaders who can lead with impact and lead collaboratively.

The collimator shall project a horizontal field of view of 8 degrees (11.3 degrees along the diagonal).  
C.	Exit Pupil Diameter 
The collimator shall have an exit pupil diameter (defined as the pupil at the location of the test item, in collimated space) of 6 inches. 
D.	Standoff Distance 
The standoff distance from the collimator to the exit pupil shall be a maximum of 12 inches.
E.	Back Working Distance 
The distance from the back of the collimator to its objective plane should be within a range of 3.5 to 5.5 inches. The collimator must be brought to a focus on this plane, for a physical emitter infrared scene generator will project an image at this plane.
F.	System Optical Blur Size
The overall system blur spot of the collimator design shall be less ant 0.5 milliradians (approximately 75% encircles energy) over 7.0 ? 12.0 micron band.
G.	Vignetting 
The collimator shall not have vignetting within the exit pupil diameter.
H.	Transmission 
All optical surfaces shall be AR coated for maximum throughput in the 7.0-12.0 micron band. As a goal, the minimum transmission of the collimator at any wavelength in the 7.0-12.0 micron band shall be no less than 85%. The predicted spectral transmission of the collimator shall be provided with the quotation. 
I.	Choice of Optical Elements 
The collimator will be fully refractive. 
J.	Ghost Images and Narcissus 
The collimator shall be analyzed for ghost image formation and narcissus. 
K.	Lens Cover 
The collimator shall have a reusable cover for the end facing the sensor under test, so the 
optical surface may be protected when the collimator is not in use. 
L.	Environmental Conditions 
The collimator will be used in a laboratory environment, with an operating temperature 
range of 65F to 75F, and an operating relative humidity range of 20% to 60%.
II.	Deliverables
The following items shall be delivered under this procurement. 

1. Collimator meeting the Specifications. 
2. Preliminary engineering and performance data. 
3. Lens prescription for the collimator, preferably in the form of a Zemax file if Zemax is the lens design package used. Any restrictions on use or dissemination of this design must be disclosed in the quotation. 
4. Dimensioned drawings for the collimator housing, showing all of the external dimensions. Drawings may be delivered in .DXF, .DWG, .PDF, or other electronic file formats. Any restrictions on use or dissemination of this design must be disclosed in the quotation and marked on the drawings.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Design and Fabricate A Vacuum Chamber, (Modification 1) which was posted on May 01, 2007. You are notified that the following changes are made: This modification is to provide answers to the following technical questions.   1.    Questions:    The requirements state that it can be out of aluminum or stainless steel.	We checked with two of the top suppliers of conflat flanges.  We have come to the conclusion that they do not make the conflat flange in aluminum.  This alone made us look at designing it out of stainless steel. Answer: There are several companies that manufacture bi-metal conflat flanges, with a weldable aluminum stub and a stainless steel sealing surface.  2. Question:  Can you provide more information on what the handholds are? Are they for lifting? Or just help guide it while it's moving? Answer:   The handholds are to be used for guiding the vacuum chamber while it is being moved and to serve as personnel handholds during 0-g testing. 3.   Question: Are the two flanges for mounting the chamber onto a skid shown in the sketch? If so please identify them to us. Answer: The flanges are to attach the chamber to a skid. The location of holes to facilitate the mounting will be provided after contract award. 4.  Questions:	Who is the positioning system manufacturer? Answer: The name of the positioning system manufacturer will be made available to the successful bidder. 5. Question: Are there drawings of the positioning system? Answer: Drawings of the positioning system will be made available to the successful bidder. 6.  Question:	Are there drawings of or examples of other similar units? Answer:  The sketch included with the solicitation is similar to a previously purchased vacuum chamber that met the requirements of this solicitation. 7. Question:  What is the bake out temperature? Answer: Once the other components of the system are installed, the chamber will not be baked out. 8.  Question:  Are there any restrictions on external reinforcing ribs. Answer:  Within reason, there are no restrictions on external stiffening ribs. I would not expect to see a significant increase in overall dimensions due to stiffening ribs. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR FABRICATION OF SINGLE CHANNEL FLOW TEST ARTICLE.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to Answer questions asked before the due date. 1. Question:  Note 7 on the drawing reference a hydrotest in accordance with ASME SectionVIII of the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code and then specifies a hydrotest pressure 3.51 times the working pressure. ASME only requires 1.3 for Hydrotest. Which is correct? 1  Answer:  Since the hydroproof test can only be performed at an ambient temperature, the new amplifier is arrived at, with MSFC Stress Group concurrence, by multiplying the code value and a ratio of the elevated (operation) temperature material strength and the ambient (hydrotest) temperature in order to simulate a proof test at operating conditions.   2. Question:  There are two working pressures specified on the drawing. Which applies to which part?  Answer:  One pressure is for the helium environment and the other pressure is for the NaK environment.  The helium plenum can be found on sheet 3.  In essence, everything above find 7 is helium pressure, and below find 7 is NaK pressure. 3.  Question:  Is there a specification or statement of work associated with this procurement? Answer:  The specifications are posted on the same website with  the drawings. 4. Questions:  There are several notes on the drawings that reference ASME Code and compliance thereto.      a. Does the supplier have to be an ASME Code shop to respond?    Answer 4a:  No, but the welds would have to be performed by a code certified welder having appropriate documentation and a weld process witness (quality verification).  Question 4b. There are additional notes within the drawing package stating "seal weld" which is not in compliance with that Code. Is that an exemption and how does one determine which  welds can be seal welds and which must conform to ASME Section VIII ? Answer 4b:  Seal welds are only to prevent fluid leaks and not to contain pressure.  All seal welds are identified as such. Question 4c: Several weld symbols show square edged butt joints that are not in accordance with ASME Code requirements.  Answer: 4c. A square butt weld is an acceptable code weld and is not excluded by the code.  The wall thickness is less than practical to bevel thus allowing a square butt weld.  Question 4d. Lithium and NaK are listed as the flowing fluids in this apparatus. Are either considered "Lethal" fluids so as to require the special precautions set forth in the Code? Answer 4d:  You do not need to consider NaK or Lithium as a lethal fluid.     4e. How much of this design is the responsibility of the supplier or is it strictly a "build to print"?

Additional Answers to Questions from potential sources: 
(5.) As it relates to the Receiver, is there an encryption / de-encryption system that is going to be employed as part (integrated into) of the receiver - transmitter link?

Answer: The system needs to use COFDM encoding and decoding in order to communicate with the systems currently in place.  It does not need to use traditional encryption, i.e. DES, AES, or Type 1.

Answer: As stated above, the system will use COFDM and will not need traditional encryption.
