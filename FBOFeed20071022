<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR FLIGHT PLANNING SERVICES.  This is a market survey for Flight Planning Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing Flight Planning Services.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 488190, with a size standard of $6.5.   Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.  In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:  1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: • Type of services provided by your firm, • Size and type of services provided by   previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance), • Number of years in business.  2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services.  3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.  Attached is a draft of the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Respondents are encouraged to review the PWS and provide comments. All responses to this market survey must be received by 3:00 p.m. central time, November 2nd, 2007. All submittals should be submitted to:  Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Multi-Purpose Bldg., Rm. 313, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK. 73169.

PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The Elwha Surface Water Intake (ESWI) project will include the demolition of the existing intake structure and rock weir, and construction of the new facilities including: sheet pile control weir, intake structure, diversion pump structure, fish screen structure; tunnel repair; piping; electrical; mechanical; utilities and site work.  The site is located adjacent to the Elwha River, with a significant amount of work being done within the river channel.  Construction of temporary diversion dams and de-watering will be part of the work.  The work within the river channel and floodplain will be seasonal because of seasonally high river flows. The Elwha Water Treatment Plant (EWTP) is located immediately downstream from ESWI.  It is designed to treat water from the ESWI for use in industrial and fisheries applications by removing suspended sediments.  The proposed treatment plant will be located adjacent to the existing Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) fish rearing channel on the Elwha River west of Port Angeles in Clallam County, Washington.     The Crown 'Z' Water Road (CZR) and EWTP Area Flood Protection (AFP) will include the completion of federal levee work within the construction area incorporating Clallam County road improvements and the EWTP.  The existing county road cannot support the heavy construction traffic required to construct both ESWI and EWTP; consequently, the improvements will bring the road up to current county road safety standards for both construction and future operations use.  During construction, the Crown 'Z' Road will be used primarily for hauling route egress (the Milwaukee Railroad Grade will be used for heavy equipment access routing) for construction heavy equipment.   The EWTP Area Flood Protection was designed by the Army Corps of Engineers and is integrated into the Crown Z Water Road Improvements.  The levee construction will extend north along the Crown Z Water Road.  The levee's construction is required for protection of Crown Z Road, EWTP, Rearing Channel, and WDFW offices against the 100-year flood; in addition, there are numerous existing private facilities in the area that also require protection, including the City of Port Angeles' Ranney Well, industrial supply channel, and a future Tribal hatchery pipeline.   Due to the importance and complexity of this construction project and the ability to work with the level of Contractor expected to be selected, the NPS has stringent requirements for the Construction Management Team.  Both the Elwha Surface Water Intake and Elwha Water Treatment Plant will serve as water sources for the City of Port Angeles Water Treatment Plant, the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Hatchery, Washington State's Department of Fish and Wildlife, Nippon Paper mill, and the local community.  Washington State's Department of Health is requiring certification from a registered professional for the future Port Angeles Water Treatment Plant; thus, the NPS will also require similar registration requirements for the EWF project.  In addition, the staff's registration ensures and provides experience and knowledge for construction knowledge required. CONTRACT PERIOD: All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract.  The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods.  Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation will be $5,000,000 for the life of the contract.  The $5,000,000 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread over the life of the contract including all option years.  The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a sole source procurement to the U.S. Bancorp DBA U. S. Bank located in Minneapolis, MN to perform ancillary lockbox services associated with the lockbox collection of directly billed premiums for Medicare. This award is in conjunction with the basic lockbox collection services provided to CMS by U. S. Bank through a Treasury Financial Agent Agreement designated by Department of the Treasury authority. 

Department of the Treasury is required by law to be provided and paid for basic lockbox collection services to Federal agencies through a designated Treasury agent. The Department of the Treasury goes through a lengthy strategic acquisition and evaluation process to ensure that all designated Treasury agents meet stringent requirements necessary to provide banking services to federal agencies. The U.S. Bank has been designated by Treasury as the agent to provide basic lockbox services to CMS for which the Department of the Treasury assumes the financial responsibility for the cost of the basic collection services.  The ancillary services required in the CMS contract to be awarded under this procurement are CMS specific and, although necessary for CMS, falls outside of the basic services that are required to be provided and paid by Treasury. The ancillary services required under this procurement are an integral part of the basic lockbox collection process and should not be separated from the primary collection functions provided by the Treasury agent. To remove the ancillary services from the basic function lockbox services and place them with another company would be unnecessarily redundant, procedurally devastating, interfere with appropriate audit and reconciliation, risk the possible loss of personal beneficiary information, potentially delay collection of funds, and result in additional cost.

The U.S. Bank is uniquely qualified to perform the tasks in this procurement most economically and efficiently because, as mentioned above, has been designated by Treasury as the CMS? lockbox provider for which the Department of the Treasury assumes the financial responsibility for the cost of the basic collection services. A cost plus fixed-fee contract will be awarded with a base period of one year and four (4) one year options.  CMS also reserves the right to continue this contract effort under the JOFOC to be in place covering two (2) two-year extensions that currently exist in the Treasury Financial Agent Agreement for basic lockbox collection services, resulting in a possible 9 year contract duration.  

This is a notice of intent and not a request for quotations.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will consider all responses received NLT 3:00 PM EDT, 16 Aug 2007.  Responses shall be submitted to Monica N. Carter.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Nose Wheel Steering Linear Actuator Time Delay Relay for KC-135R/T F-108 equipped aircraft

PURPOSE
The 827 ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters to install a 3-second time delay relay to eliminate inadvertent extension of the Linear Actuator.

DESCRIPTION
The KC-135R/T F-108 equipped aircraft Nose Wheel Steering Linear Actuator (NWSLA) gradually extends following firm/bouncing landings and each time power is applied to the aircraft on the ground.  This extension results in eventual loss of rudder pedal input for Nose Wheel Steering.  A 3-second time delay relay was tested and found to successfully eliminate the extension actuation.

RESPONSE
Responses shall address:
1.	Performance parameters, to include design and installation
2.	Program Estimated Cost information (rough order of magnitude)
3.	Delivery schedule/product availability
4.	Any alternatives/suggestions that satisfy airworthiness requirements, to include cost and schedule

1010 Required Elements of Physical Examination:

1.	Pre-Placement, Mandatory Periodic, and Termination (Exit) Examinations: (See Appendix D)

The SF78, 93, and OSHA Form 22 must be completed and signed by the employee and examining physician (Appendices G-2, G-3, and G-9).

Clinical tests to be included:

a)	Vision Screening ? far, near, depth, color, fields, peripheral, lateral/vertical phoria, monocular, and binocular with and without glasses or contacts, tonometry;

b)	Vital Signs ? blood pressure, temperature, body height and weight, pulse, skin;

c)	Laboratory tests to be included:  complete blood count (hematology), urinalysis, glucose, cholesterol, chemistry (see FOH work orders 4423, 4513, 4437, or 4455 (Appendix E);

d)	EKG tracing and interpretation;

e)	Chest x-ray, report with interpretation of the x-ray, and B-read (Appendices G-6 and G-7);

f)	Pulmonary function test (Spirometry) with interpretation (3 curves); and 

g)	Audiometry (Frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000): 14-hour noise free period prior to testing.  If there is a Standard Threshold Shift (STS), a repeat test must be given within 14 days.

There is to be a doctor-patient discussion of significant findings on the examination.  The doctor is to send a copy of the physical examination and tests to the patient and to the MRO.

2.	Mine Rescue Team Examination:

Note:  While many of the clinical and laboratory tests are the same as in pre-placement, mandatory periodic, and termination examinations, the standards are more stringent.  The physical examination is done annually and the chest x-ray is done with the physical every third year (See Appendix H ? Mine Rescue Guidelines).

The examining physician must conduct an in-depth medical history according to 30 CFR 49.7 
Clinical tests to be included:
		
a)	Vision Screening: far, near, depth, color, fields, peripheral, lateral/vertical phoria, monocular, and binocular with and without glasses or contacts, tonometry;

b)	Vital Signs: blood pressure, temperature, body height and weight, pulse, skin;

f)	Pulmonary Function Test (Spirometry) with interpretation (3 curves); and

g)	Audiometry (Frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000): 14-hour noise free period prior to testing.  If there is a Standard Threshold Shift (STS), a repeat test must be given within 14 days.

The exam must include a doctor-patient discussion of positive findings on examination.  The doctor is to send a copy of the physical examination and tests to the patient and to the MRO.

MSHA Checklist for Periodic/Exit Exams

The examining physician must discuss the medical history form (SF 93) and any pre-existing conditions with patient.  The examining physician must then address and document any positive medical history, physical findings, and significant abnormal lab values before exam is sent for QA.  Ensure that all requested forms and test results are attached!  Incomplete forms and missing test results ultimately delay the review which can restrict employees from regular duties.

<SUBJECT>A -- Effective Recovery and Napping Strategies
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

INVESTIGATION OF EFFECTIVE RECOVERY AND NAPPING STRATEGIES
FOR COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE DRIVERS PHASES 1 AND 2
(September 2007)


1.	INTRODUCTION

Transport Canada (TC) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) are the sponsors of this research under a collaborative research project agreement signed between them. Under terms of the agreement, Transport Canada?s Transportation Development Centre (TDC) is responsible for the overall management, design and conduct of the research, all in accordance with its own normal practices and procedures.

The essence of the entire research to be undertaken under the above noted agreement is described from an overall perspective in APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??, Project Implementation Plan: Investigation of Effective Recovery and Napping Strategies for Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers (revision date of September, 2007).

This Work Statement is for undertaking only a part (Phases 1 and 2) of the overall four phases of research described therein.

2.	OBJECTIVES

Undertake Phases 1 and 2 of an overall research project described in general terms in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??:

Phase 1 (Napping research): Develop napping research protocols, undertake empirical research, and recommend potentially effective napping strategies for CMV drivers.

Phase 2: (Recovery research): Develop recovery research protocols, undertake empirical research, and recommend potentially effective recovery strategies for CMV drivers:


3.	SCOPE

The scope of the study shall include:

Phase 1 (Napping Research) will involve the development and recommendation of napping research protocols, and subsequent implementation through simulator and/or field studies. Research protocols shall examine proactive naps aimed at preventing fatigue (napping prior to a work period) and reactive naps aimed at reducing and managing fatigue during the work day (napping in response to perception of fatigue). This phase of research will conclude with the recommendation of potentially effective napping strategies appropriate to the motor carrier industry.

Phase 2 (Recovery Research) will involve the development and recommendation of recovery research protocols, and subsequent implementation through simulator and/or field studies. This research will investigate the recovery effects associated with consolidated and split sleep during daily duty cycles, and immediately after completion of a ?day driving week? and a ?night driving week?. This phase of research will conclude with the recommendation of potentially effective recovery strategies appropriate to the motor carrier industry.

The research protocols should include an equal number of motor carriers and drivers from both Canada and the U.S.

The results of Phases 1 and 2 will be presented in two technical reports, respectively, including work performed, results, conclusions and recommendations. However, the research and reports of each of the two phases must address the relationships between napping and principal sleep periods such that their relative and combined effects on driver fatigue can be better understood; and such that the results will be useful for purposes of schedule planning and dealing with schedule perturbations.


4.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK

The PIP of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A?? describes the four phases of the overall project including objectives, deliverables, background considerations, method of implementation, and estimated schedule and budget. The PIP reflects the vision of the principal stakeholders, and is to be used as a general guideline. Bidders are expected to use their creativity and expertise to develop comprehensive bids that will address the objectives of the work to be undertaken under each of Phases 1 and 2, within the context of achieving the objectives of the overall research. 

Bids should consider addressing napping and recovery strategies that would be the most beneficial to drivers and could be applied by the industry to better manage fatigue.

Phases 1 and 2 are to be performed concurrently to the greatest extent possible. Bidders must provide bids for performance of the work included in both of Phases 1 and 2. Each phase must be addressed separately, However, the research and reports of each of the two phases must address the relationships between napping and principal sleep periods such that their relative and combined effects on driver fatigue can be better understood; and such that the results will be useful for purposes of schedule planning and dealing with schedule perturbations.

In addition to the tasks required to execute the work described in the PIP of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??, the contractor is required to perform the following additional tasks for each of the two phases.


4.1.	Work Plan

Produce a detailed overall work plan, activity schedule, cash flow projection, project management control, and documentation procedures within three weeks of effective contract commencement date. These are to be submitted to TDC for review and approval. The work plan is to include the dates for submission and review of milestone and final reports, as well as dates of steering committee review meetings described in Section 5.6.


4.2.	 Milestone Reports

Upon completion of each major activity or milestone of the project, each of which are to be presented in the bid and later refined in the work plan of Section 4.1, prepare and submit a milestone report prepared in accordance with Section 5.7.

4.3.	Final Report

	Upon completion of the work, prepare a final report describing the objectives, scope and methodology, all work performed, data gathered and its analysis, results, conclusions and recommendations. The final report shall be prepared and submitted to TDC for review and acceptance in accordance with section 7 ?Final Report and Delivery?.
	
	
5.	PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

5.1.	TDC Project Authority

TDC Project Authority will manage the project on behalf of TDC and other sponsors. The TDC Project Authority will also be responsible for the management and conduct of steering committee meetings to be held during the course of the project.   (See Contract, clause entitled ??Project Authority??)

5.2	PWGSC Contracting Authority

Contract administration will be provided by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), which will appoint a Science Procurement Officer. (See Contract, clause entitled ??Contracting Authority).

5.3	Contractor Project Control

The contractor shall control the project by a CPM, PERT, SPEC, PC-based Microsoft Project or equivalent responsibility assignment and scheduling method. Budgets for each project element should be prepared at the start of the project and monitored regularly to ensure resources available are compatible with estimates to complete the work. Any difficulties or problems must be brought to the attention of the TDC Project Authority and PWGSC Science Procurement Officer as soon as possible to ensure that remedial measures can be expeditiously developed and applied.

5.4	Progress Reports

Progress reports shall be submitted electronically on a monthly basis, and no later than the 14th day of each month, to the TDC Project Officer with a copy to the PWGSC Science Procurement Officer. These reports shall be prepared using the MS Word template entitled TDC Progress Report (form TDC/CDT 2004-001, hard copy is provided in Attachment 2), and the electronic file saved as a *.doc file named according to the following convention: contract number, year-month-day.doc (e.g., T8200-123456-789-ABC, 2004-10-27.doc). Progress reports are to be prepared in the English language.


5.5	Coordination of Project Activities

Coordination of activities between the contractor and participating organizations, including at the field level, will be the responsibility of the designated representatives of the contractor and those of the participating organizations to the greatest extent possible.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health Department of Medical Record intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with 3M Company 122515 Plum Orchard Drive, Silver Springs, and MD 20904 this company has Sole Proprietorship of ChartScript Product. The Government has intent to sole source this requirement under Simplified Acquisition procedures under FAR 6.302 and FAR Part 12 under Commercial Services. 
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ97478 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-20.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519. 
The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center, Medical Record Department, NIH, CC, MRD, has traditionally coded patients? diagnoses and procedures utilizing the ICD coding methodology in a very limited fashion focusing predominantly on the need to retrieve historical reference data for research purposes.  These codes are currently determined and assigned based primarily on information included in discharge summary and operation reports dictated by the medical staff rather than additional information/details/specificity that may be available or abstracted from information documented in the medical record.  The MRD currently has a need to raise the CC coding and abstracting practices to industry standard.  Such improvements involve expanding the current processes beyond the review and coding of ambulatory surgery, inpatient admissions, and initial outpatient encounters to encompass a broader range of services including the incorporation of updated ICD-9-CM and CPT coding assignments. The Medical Record Department currently utilizes nearly the full suite of SoftMed?s (3M?s) health information management products and seamless integration with those products is critical.  In addition, these products also send and receive information through well-established interfaces to and from the hospital information system, the Clinical Center?s Clinical Research Information System, CRIS, to support patient care and research activities.  Interfaces between these applications/systems have been established for nearly ten years and allow patient demographics, Admission/Discharge/Transfer Information, medical orders, and medical reports to flow between the SoftMed Systems applications and the CRIS to support the specific functions of incomplete medical record management, medical record tracking, transcription of medical reports, and clinician editing and finalizing of medical reports. In addition, the CC/MRD has the responsibility for maintaining a permanent medical record for each Clinical Center patient for patient care, biomedical research and medico-legal purposes.  These medical records have traditionally been microfilmed for preservation in perpetuity after a five year period of inactivity or patient expiration.  Additionally, active medical records with multiple volumes may have been filmed to conserve storage requirements for hardcopy records.  These microfilmed and inactive medical records have been converted to digital image with storage of these images residing in Softmed?s ChartView application. The purpose of this order is to provide the NIH, CC, MRD with applications and services necessary to support the improvement of coding and abstracting processes with Chart Script Product, ChartScript/MD Product,Chart Management, Interface and /or Batch Applications Product, and Document Acquisition   Additional outcomes from this initiative include the following benefits/enhancements beyond the current MRD processes:

?X	Code diagnoses, comorbidities and procedures to a much higher degree of specificity.
?X	Provide the ability to understand and abstract coexisting conditions (complications or comorbidities) that affect the patient?s treatment during a particular visit.
?X	Provide a valuable research data set by capturing a complete list of diagnoses, procedures and comorbidities that could be also be pulled into a problem list within CRIS.
?X	Identify and code a primary diagnosis (protocol related diagnosis), admitting diagnosis, and other pertinent diagnoses.
?X	Capture the protocol relative to the patient?s visit/inpatient admission and audit/compare this information to protocols/health issues identified in CRIS.
?X	Provide the capability to understand/analyze coexisting conditions including complications or comorbidities that affect the patient?s treatment for each visit.
?X	Provide a valuable (more complete and accurate reflection of patients? primary diagnoses/comorbidities and procedures relative to protocol assignment) research data set for historical retrieval and resource allocation/projections.
?X	Enhancement of the current installed ChartView, ESA, and ChartScript applications in the CC/MRD health information management systems to provide web accessibility.


The vendor shall provide the NIH, CC, MRD with the following to meet the objectives identified in Section B., above.

?X	required system software
?X	encoder reference software
?X	software implementation services including project management, onsite training, and technical services
?X	reporting modules
?X	user licenses
?X	24 hours/day, 365 days/year enhancement and support services with access to a support hotline, remote diagnostic support, and all enhancements to installed systems
?X	HP rack-mountable test server as necessary

<DESC>The purposes of this Amendment are to:
1.	Publish questions and answers relative to this Solicitation; and
2.	Extend the deadline for offers to 5:00 p.m., EDT, on October 29, 2007.

NO MORE QUESTIONS ARE ALLOWED BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AMENDMENT AND THE DEADLINE FOR OFFERS.

Specifically, this Solicitation is amended as follows:

1.  The questions and the MCC?s responses are provided below.

Question 1:  Section entitled "Description".  In the third paragraph, you state "A medical emergency is defined as physical, mental, and/or natal." We would like to suggest that you augment this statement with language that will define when an evacuate needs to occur. A suggestion would be to follow this with "a physical, mental, and/or natal condition in which either the person is currently hospitalized in an in-patient capacity, or has a condition which requires in-patient hospitalization." This definition would establish a finite criterion for evacuation and avoid the issue of having a mandated evacuation for a person who just needs limited out-patient treatment (sutures, blood tests, etc.) where an evacuation would not be medically appropriate.  
Answer 1:  The third paragraph will remain unchanged.  

Question 2:  In the following paragraph, you reference the term "eligible family members". Can we have a description of who the MCC considers to be eligible? Is this just the spouse or dependant children of an MCC employee, or does it extend to the employee's siblings, parents, and other relatives that might be visiting them in their host country? 
Answer 2:  An eligible family member refers to the individual's dependent children and spouse.  

Question 3:  Towards the end of that paragraph, it is specified that the "final decision on medical evacuations for MCC employees and eligible family members are to be made in joint consultation between the contractor, the U.S. Embassy medical staff, and if possible the injured party or his/her guardian." There is no language in the current RFP specifying that the final choice destination hospital be made by the patient (or the patient's emergency contact person if the patient is incapacitated). We suggest that the decision making be in the hands of the patient, with the assistance of the U.S. Embassy medical staff, eligible family members, and the patient's current attending physician and their own home primary care physician as it relates to choice of destination hospital. The contractor should also be responsible for providing expert-level medical advisory services from a top-50 U.S. Hospital to assist the patient in making this decision. This will ensure that the patient has the right to determine and be transported to wherever the best medical care for their condition can be obtained. There is also no specific language calling for evacuation back to the United States. Without language such as this, the contractor can elect to transport the patient to the least expensive destination, perhaps not even back to their home country. The notion of "closest appropriate hospital", as defined by a contractor, could be one that just provides "adequate" care which could result in the patient receiving a lower quality of care than they deserve. The nightmare of a sick MCC employee stationed in Mongolia, for example, would only get magnified by their evacuation to "the closest appropriate hospital" in Kazakhstan, as could be currently allowed by the RFP as written.  
Answer 3:  The evacuation does not need to be back to the United States but to the closest appropriate hospital.  The U.S. Embassy will determine the "closest appropriate hospital."  

Question 4:  Is there a limit to the number of possible evacuations per employee or family member per year? Similarly, is there a cap limit to how much the contractor would be expected to spend per evacuation? Most standard agreements specify no more than two evacuations per person per year and a cap of $500,000 per evacuation. (The most expensive evacuations do not cost over $250,000, so this amount should be more than adequate.)  
Answer 4:  A single person could, in theory, have multiple evacuations.  This is, however, unlikely since anyone living abroad must receive a medical clearance before going back overseas.  A person traveling on TDY should not be limited to the number of evacuations.

Question 5:  In the section identified as a service that is "Highly Desirable", can you specify where the pregnant person and her dependant children need to be evacuated to? Once again, we suggest that language is included that indicates the destination be the patient's choice. Of course, a woman in her third trimester of pregnancy does not necessarily require in-patient hospitalization. We would like to suggest that the evacuation destination be the closest appropriate commercial airport to the employee?s permanent home address. We would also like to suggest that the father-to-be also be evacuated back to their home airport (if it is possible for him based on his workload) a few days prior to the expected due date to be available during the birth of his child. We also would like to ask if the MCC is expecting the contractor to pay the cost of the return transportation for the mother, dependants, and father/employee back to the host country after the six-week post-birth period has elapsed.  
Answer 5:  The pregnant employee or pregnant spouse has the option of going to a MCC designated site or to return to the United States.  Preferred would be for the contractor to cover medevac costs to/from point of birth for pregnant employee or spouse and dependent children.  

Question 6:  Under the Deliverables heading, item B. states the contractor will coordinate for a family member to join a traveler who is left alone or hospitalized for more than 7 days. Does this mean the contractor is expected to pay the costs of transporting this family member? Is the contractor responsible for hotel arrangements and costs and per diem expense costs for this family member? Is the contractor responsible for the costs of returning this family member back to their point-of-departure when they are ready to be returned or after the traveler is discharged?  
Answer 6:  The vendor should include what they are prepared to offer.

Question 7:  Under the Deliverables heading, item C. states the contractor will coordinate for the return home any minor children left unattended due to a medical emergency and provide a qualified escort if necessary. Again, does the term "coordinate" mean the contractor is expected to pay for these transportation costs or simply arrange them and pass the invoice on to MCC or the family? Is the contractor responsible for the costs of returning the minor children back to the host country if the medical issue resolves and the parents wish for their children's return? Can you define "qualified escort"? Should this escort be an actual deployable employee of the contractor with advanced medical and/or military training who can safeguard the minor children until they are reunited with their family?  
Answer 7:  The vendor should include what they are prepared to offer.

Question 8:  Under the Deliverables heading, item D. states that a traveler's mortal remains should be returned to their permanent residence. We would suggest this statement be amended to state "permanent residence or other place designated by their estate." (This would allow remains to be transported only once in the event that a family would like their deceased buried in a location other than their current permanent residence.)
Answer 8:  The vendor should include what they are prepared to offer.

Question 9:  Under the Deliverables heading, item E. states the contractor will facilitate the transfer of medication, vaccines, and blood products as necessary. Again, can you state whether or not the contractor is expected to pay for either the products themselves or their shipping, or just arrange for their purchase and transportation.  
Answer 9:  The requirement is to facilitate the transfer.

Question 10:  Under the Deliverables heading, item F. refers to several service tasks the contractor is expected to perform, including making reservations for airlines, hotels, and other travel services; assist in replacing passports, tickets, and other important documents; providing immediate translation services; and arranging for the replacement of corrective lenses or medical devices. Once again, is contractor expected to pay for the above items, including tickets, hotel rooms, or new eyeglasses without any reimbursement from the MCC or traveler themselves?  
Answer 10:  The RFP states that these are services that the contractor should provide, with no expectation of the company covering the actual costs of the items.

Question 11:  Also under item F., it states that the contractor will provide medical referrals for worldwide medical and dental care. Is the selection of physicians and dentists, and the payment of the medical and dental bill, the obligation of the contractor or the patient?  
Answer 11:  The requirement is to provide the services of referring physicians and dentists and assisting with any payment problems.  The actual payment is the responsibility of the individual. 

Question 12:  Will the MCC provide a list of employees and eligible family members to the contractor prior to beginning the term of the agreement? Will the list include pertinent information related to emergency contacts, medical history, permanent and temporary residences, primary care physicians, and other medical information? Is there any upper age limit to the population covered?  
Answer 12:  No.

Question 13:  Is the contractor under any specific obligation to deploy their own personnel if at all possible to accompany the sick or injured traveler during their evacuation from their point of origin all the way back to their destination hospital? Frequently, international medical evacuations may require multiple carriers and transfers of the patient from service to service as they are brought across the globe back to their home hospital of choice. With these transfers of care, it is frequently advantageous and medically appropriate to have a "medical escort" who can accompany the patient from start to finish making sure they are getting the finest level of care. Is this something that the MCC would require of their contractor?  
Answer 13:  No.

Question 14:  This RFP seems to specify that you are just looking for a contractor who can provide a "hospital-to-hospital" evacuation. Is there any specific requirement for search and rescue capability? What would happen if one of your travelers was in a remote region and became ill or injured? Would you like the contractor to have the ability to provide their own search and rescue personnel to perform an actual field evacuation of the traveler, or would you just leave it to the injured party to try and perform their own self-rescue to get to a hospital for eventual evacuation? If possible, should these search and rescue personnel have any specific background experience, such as military special-forces, and should they be actual direct employees of the contractor, or would you accept whatever local provider a contractor can pull out of a phonebook? 
Answer 14:  Search and rescue are not a requirement under the Statement of Work.  However, the contractor should have the ability to provide whatever needs of transport is required - with appropriate medical support - to move the injured party from a remote location to an appropriate medical venue.
