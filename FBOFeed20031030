<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-16. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-03-RP-74731 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  The Government intends to obtain an analysis to verify or improve the accuracy of the current loss adjustment standards handbook (LASH) procedures and factors for projecting damage due to stand reduction and the seed count appraisal methods for the canola/rapeseed, crambe, and mustard crops.   BACKGROUND:  When insured acreage of canola/rapeseed, crambe, or mustard suffers crop damage, an appraisal is made to determine the amount and extent of crop damage.  Canola/rapeseed, crambe, or mustard appraisals are performed whenever insurable acreage will not be harvested or production to count cannot be determined using actual records of harvested production (such as, if the insured wishes to put the crop to another use, or if the crop is damaged to the extent that it is not economically feasible for the insured to carry the crop to harvest).  Appraisals may also be required for pre-harvest inspections, or to establish the insurability of acreage that is reported after the acreage reporting date.  The current canola/rapeseed, crambe, or mustard loss adjustment procedure has three appraisal methods: (1) The stand reduction method is used for planted acreage plants have not emerged from the seed, and to appraise plants in the vegetative stage.  (2) The plant damage method is used to appraise plants that are in the flowering stage.  (3) The seed count method is used to appraise plants that are in the podding-ripening stage.  The Contractor shall research and evaluate the current LASH procedures and factors for estimating Percent of Damage From Stand Reduction (refer to TABLE B in the Canola and Mustard LASH, and TABLE C in the Crambe LASH), and the seed count appraisal methods for Canola/Rapeseed, Crambe, and Mustard, and then report to the Government its findings, determinations and recommendations.  Any proposed revisions to current factors and/or procedures must improve the accuracy of the current stand reduction appraisal methods or seed count methods being evaluated. If the contractor can prove that there are insufficient data to make a statistically sound analysis for a specific crop, the Government may accept recommendations derived from data obtained from one of the other crops if research supports this action. Additionally, the Contractor shall provide assistance to independent researchers or RMA personnel who may wish to reproduce the Contractor's modeling or analysis for product testing and validation.  The Government anticipates that this will be a firm fixed price award, and reserves the right to award without discussions.  The Government cost estimate for this project is based on an anticipated 1376 professional labor hours of effort.  FOR AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF THE COMPLETE SOW FOR THIS RFP, PLEASE GO TO http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp AND LOOK UP THIS RFP NUMBER: 1435-04-03-RP-74731.  Period of Performance:  See specific SOW documents for details.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, (A) A CAPABILITIES STATEMENT detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the effort, including subcontractors) with their qualifications and specific experience;  (2) specific organizational experience for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization have performed within the last two years; and (3) overall past performance including specific references (include contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number).  References will be checked. Capabilities Statements will be evaluated based on; (i) key personnel skills, abilities and experience; (ii) your organization's experience and (iii) past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects), adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products.  (B) A TECHNICAL PROPOSAL in accordance with the proposal instructions in the SOW.   (C) A COST PROPOSAL, which shall be a separate volume from the written portion of the Technical Proposal.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-16. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-04-RP-32007 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  The Government intends to obtain an analysis to verify or improve the accuracy of the current rules and factors for the Hail and Fire Exclusion to the crop insurance program.   BACKGROUND: The Crop Insurance Act of 1980 contained language that provided for an option that would allow an insured to exclude Hail and Fire as causes of loss from the federal policy.  The premise of this exclusion was to reduce the federal crop premium by an amount equal to the cost of purchasing private Hail and Fire coverage.  Under this Act, producers had to purchase an equal amount of coverage under a private Hail policy.  The credit was 40% of the prevailing county Hail and Fire premium from the private companies.  The credit could not be less than 15% or more than 30% of the MPCI premium.  Lastly, the credit would be applied to the premium after subsidy.  In 1994, the Hail and Fire Exclusion was changed.  The credit was significantly reduced in most counties.  The industry, along with RMA, has expressed concerns regarding the levels of the credit and how the credit is calculated.  With the significant increase in federal subsidies since 1994, along with the reduction of the credit to exclude Hail and Fire as causes of loss, the industry feels that producers don't have the same incentive to elect the exclusion as they did before the changes in 1994.  Indeed, very few producers are choosing to exclude Hail and Fire from their MPCI policies and purchase Hail coverage from private insurers.  With these issues in mind, RMA is contracting to analyze and review the current rules and factors for the Hail and Fire Exclusion.  In addition, it will be necessary to determine if the recommendations by the Contractor will be appropriate under RMA's current methodology or if changes in methodology are needed.  The Government anticipates that this will be a firm fixed price award, and reserves the right to award without discussions.  The Government cost estimate for this project is based on an anticipated 581 professional labor hours of effort.  FOR AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF THE COMPLETE SOW FOR THIS RFP, PLEASE GO TO http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp AND LOOK UP THIS RFP NUMBER: 1435-04-04-RP-32007.

These Forest Highways are not included in the scope of this PWS.  There are approximately 45 miles of paved and 247 miles of aggregate and natural soil system roads. In addition there are approximately 50 miles of cemetery and 22 miles of interior facility roads. Of LBLs 357 miles of trails, approximately 100 miles receive intermittent maintenance; the other 257 miles receive infrequent maintenance.  The roads and trails are a combination of bituminous paved, gravel, and native material.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412th Test Wing, Electronic Warfare Directorate, intends to award a one-year contract extension with a one-year option to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company to support Simulation Development, Operations and Maintenance for the Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator (AFEWES).  Authority for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) per FAR 6.302-1(a).  AFEWES is a hardware-in-the-loop test facility located at Air Force Plant 4, Ft. Worth, Texas that develops, validates and operates high fidelity threat simulators for testing electronic warfare (EW) effectiveness.  The AFEWES facility provides secure, technical evaluations of EW systems and techniques against radar and infrared (IR) guided terminal threat systems, surface-to-air missiles (SAM), and IR air-to-air missiles.  The AFEWES facility incorporates both hardware and software to simulate threat systems and interact with U.S. and allied EW systems. AFEWES supports testing throughout all phases of the electronic warfare threat countermeasure evaluation cycle for DoD, EW programs, and allied foreign military customers.  Real world events requires a continuity of services from the existing contractor who currently possesses the requisite knowledge, capabilities, and demonstrated performance to operate and maintain existing AFEWES threat system simulators and provide the development/modification and integration of AFEWES unique threat simulation capabilities.  The Government must ensure that near-term U.S. and allied mission essential requirements continue to be met at the existing level of support without mission degradation.  It is the intent of the Government to issue this contract extension to the incumbent, with a period of performance of one year with an option for a second year, using other than full and open competition under FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii)(B).  This period will allow adequate time for the Government to complete actions necessary to assess current requirements necessary to enable a potential competition of a future acquisition as well as explore the possibility of consolidating AFEWES capabilities to reduce future operating costs. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this proposed extension. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Direct all communications concerning this notice by e-mail to Alan Wall at alan.wall@edwards.af.mil.  E-mails shall contain full text and shall not include attachments.  Notes 8,22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, and materials to support the commercial flooring requirements, exclusive of residential flooring, for Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho facilities.  The materials and services to be provided by the contractor shall be of the best available quality as outlined in the solicitation and statement of work.  Materials and labor to be provided include, but are not limited to, carpet, tile, sheet vinyl, cove base, wood base, installation and removal of listed materials, floor repair, and trimming of provided doors.  This solicitation shall result in a firm-fixed priced requirements type contract that shall consist of a base year and four one-year options.  The government anticipates recurring requirements but cannot predetermine the precise quantities that designated government activities will need during a definite period.  The government intends to fill all actual purchase requirements for supplies and/or services by placing orders with the contractor within the scope of the contract.  Because the government may encounter unforeseen conditions under old flooring, additional supplies and/or services may be added to the contract.  Such additions shall be added by bilateral modifications.  If potential contractors submitted proposals for solicitation F10603-03-R-0003 which was cancelled, new and complete proposals must be submitted for this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 442210.  The government intends to set-aside this requirement for small business and is waiting for a ruling from the Small Business Association.  A modification to this synopsis shall be posted at a later date stating the set-aside status.  Solicitation documents will be made available on or about 15 September 2003.

<DESC>DESC: The Air Force Research Laboratory, Contracting Directorate, on behalf of the Space Vehicles Directorate, Integrated Experiments and Evaluation Division, Kirtland AFB, NM, intends to award a sole source contract to MicroSat Systems, Inc. (MSI) for the following described effort based on technology developed and demonstrated by MSI under previously awarded open competition.


BACKGROUND: 

The history of RSP is embedded in the TechSat 21 effort.  TechSat 21 is an Other Transaction for Prototype (OTA) issued under VS-00-01 BAA, Technical Area Number 10, Microsatellite Formation Flying, synopsized on 17 Dec 1999.   Due to funding issues and change in program direction, the OT is being converted to a FAR Cost Plus Fixed Fee, completeion type contract.

The objective of Techsat 21 was to show demonstration of formations of microsatellites flying in close proximity to perform missions otherwise performed by larger, monolithic satellites.

The objective of RSP is to rapidly design, build, test, and field an operationally relevant microsatellite system; reduce timelines for development, test, launch, and checkout; and provide a responsive capability to the user.

 
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this proposed contract is to: 

Build, and deliver a microsatellite bus, using available excess hardware, within nine months; and, leverage previous government investment on the development of small, low cost satellite components and systems.  There will be options for two additional microsatellite buses.  This contract is meant to build upon the effort developed under the VS-00-01 BAA, Technical Area Number 10, Microsatellite Formation Flying, for Other Transaction for Prototype, awarded Jul 00 to MSI.     

The period of performance for the above effort is 20 months, to also include integration, testing, launch and six months of on-orbit operations, with an anticipated start date of Nov 2003. The option periods will not be more than 18 months each.  A contract will be awarded to MSI, provided other sources cannot furnish the services at equivalent terms. Respondents are required to provide sufficient information concerning their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance in order for the project office to determine the requirements can be met. A cost and technical proposal is required, to include a draft program plan, list of government furnished information or property required, statement of work including work breakdown structure (WBS), program schedule, management plan, risk and technology management, as well as resumes of key personnel.  The technical proposal is limited to a total of 25 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. The cost proposal should include an estimate to include hours and rates, and summary by WBS for a cost plus fixed fee type contract.  Submit responses of intent to Shari Barnett, Det 8 PKVI, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773 no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement by 4:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Firms responding should indicate if they are a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a Woman-Owned Business and/or a HUBZone Certified Small Business Concern. To be considered a Small Business the following applies: SIC 541710, size standard 1,000 employees. Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp for further information on certification and the approval process.  The offeror is required to submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with its proposal.  It is anticipated that a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, with a classification level of Top Secret/SCI is required during the performance of this effort.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  in an effort to meet  its mandated time schedules operates the Resource Management Transportation Office. This office is charged with the responsibility of merging 22 previously disparate domestic agencies into one Department. This transformation is time sensitive due to the security aspects of  the  mission of DHS. The GSA has identified a ready to occupy built out facility located at 1120 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington D.C. The facility contains all of the necessary infrastructure components necessary to occupy the facility including modular office furniture which was configured into the space to meet the requirements of the previous tenant. This office furniture is available to the DHS for immediate use.  Based on market research and an independent government estimate, to purchase the current as is furniture from the lessor would result in a great savings to the Government. In addition, it would provide the Government with a ready to occupy facility saving up to a years time which would be needed to build out the space and configuring the furniture into the floor space. Based on this, the DHS has determined that the 1120 Vermont Avenue Associates is the only responsible source who can meet the time requirements of the DHS.  Therefore, DHS intends to negotiate a noncompetitive contract for the purchase of the as is furniture.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  All interested parties must respond by November 12, 2003. All parties who believe that they can provide modular furniture consisting of Ethospace and Resolve lines of furniture may submit a capability statement to the Contracting Officer.  All responses shall be written.  The responses must provide clear and concise documentation indicating your firms capability to provide the furniture described above. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to HSSCHQ-04-Q-00061. If after November 12, 2003, no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, DHS shall negotiate solely with the 1120 Vermont Avenue Associates.  All responses will be evaluated to determine if they can meet the time and cost requirements.***** See note 22

In addition to the submarine wire coils, the resulting contract is anticipated to provide for the purchase of an Inspection System Program Plan. The Government currently anticipates that the evaluation criteria used in this competition will focus strongly on technical ability, past performance and price. The anticipated competition will be based on a build-to-print hardware specification. In total, this contract is anticipated to provide the Navy with a contract vehicle to efficiently and cost-effectively acquire submarine wire coils in order to support fleet readiness needs. For planning purposes and to promote competition, one page E-mail expressions of interest denoting PRIME CONTRACTOR CONSIDERATION  are requested from all potential offerors.  1) all pertinent company information (name, address, state of incorporation, etc.) and 2) appropriate business unit, subcontractor and small business  points of contact, should be included and submitted to this office to the care of Mrs. Renee Brooks at brooksrc@navsea.navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), intends to enter into a sole source contract with Children's Hospital of Oakland, BACPAC Resources, 474 52nd Street, Oakland, CA. 94609 and Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason Research CTR, 1201 Ninth Avneue, Seattle, WA. 98101.  The Genetics Branch goal is to sequence relevant chromosomal breakpoints through the use of long-range PCR with reference to the completed sequence of the human genome.  The Genectics Branch supports extramural and private initiatives for structural characterization of cancers and derived cancer cell lines by "conventional" as well as novel sequencing technologies.  The Genetics Branch intentions are to: 1) build a foundation of data sets representing the elucidation of the genome anatomy for selected tumors, cell lines, and cell lineages, 2) integrate these data sets with data on gene expression, morphology, virulence, and other phenotypic parameters, and 3) use the foundation of the initial work for the formulation of testable hypotheses concerning required steps in the development and progression of cancer, lineage specific mechanisms of instability, genotype-phenotype relationships, and the basis of evolutionary selection or programmatic choice.  In brief, the Genetics Branch screening process for sequences of interest is to develop four categories of clones: 1) those whose ends are consistent with the known contiguity of the human genome sequence; 2) those whose two ends appear to be discontinuous compared to the human genome sequence and for which there exists more than one independent example where the two novel genomic regions are juxtaposed; 3) those where there is one example of a novel juxtaposition but additional molecular cytogenetic data supports this novel juxtaposition; and 4) those for which there is only one example of a novel juxatposition.  The Genetics Branch, CCR requires the services of the Children's Hospital of Oakland and its staff and Benaroya Research Institute and its staff for the preparation of BAC libraries that are the prerequisite for this project.  The Children's Hospital of Oakland and Benaroya Research Institute are the only sources known to the NCI with the specific vectors, the track record of production of appropriately high tittered and arrayed libraries, and the staffing required for the preparation of this project.  However, if any interested party believes that it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail with the necessary documentation to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EST, on November 14, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to cb106x @nih.gov., attention Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This requirement is being procured based on FAR 13 the use of simplified acquisition procedures.  No collet calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 622110.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The US Army CECOM, Project Manager Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition, Fort Belvoir, VA, is issuing a sources sought for Driver's Vision Enhancers (DVE) B-Kits. The Department of Defense has placed an increasing priority on e xpanding the service's ability to operate vehicles more effectively during night and obscured battlefield conditions. The DVE family of devices improves the vehicle driver's performance envelope, respectively, over currently fielded systems. The DVE is an infrared-imaging driver's device for combat vehicles (CV) and tactical-wheeled vehicles (TWV) that is designed to enhance vehicle maneuverability during daylight, darkness, adverse weather, and dirty battlefield conditions. The DVE is comprised of an A-Kit  (vehicle unique: brackets, wiring, etc.) and a B-Kit (sensor and display package). The purpose of this program is to procure DVE B-Kits. The DVE B-Kit consists of an uncooled, long-wave, thermal-imaging sensor and flat-panel display package. The thermal-i maging sensor can be one of two configurations: a TWV configuration and a CV configuration. The flat-panel display package contains the electronic operational controls for the DVE system. The DVE A-kits will be furnished by the Government and integrated by  the B-Kit contractors for system-level qualification testing. The DVE B-Kits must meet all the requirements set forth in the statement of work, the interface control document, and the applicable performance specification (MIL-PRF-49256B(CR)). The Governme nt's intent is to make two awards for this competitive acquisition on a 60/40 split basis. Award(s) will be firm-fixed-price, three (3) year, multi-year contracts, each with a one (1) year option for a total period of four (4) years (performing from FY04 t o FY07). The 60-percent award will be made to the best overall proposal that is determined to be most beneficial to the government. The 40-percent award will be made to the second best overall proposal. The Government reserves the right to award a single c ontract for the total requirements of the solicitation in the event that only one conforming offer is received. Anticipated total quantities for this contractual effort are as follows: TWV base: 1934, options 11,425; CV base: 600, options 5229. The option quantities are spread through the contract years. Some options are provided for the purposes of foreign military sales (FMS) requirements. The Government's intent is to procure the DVE A-Kits through a separate contract action. Information pertaining to th e A-Kit acquisition is available through separate entry on the Business Opportunity Page (refer to solicitation W15P7T-04-R-J201). See also numbered note 26.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR X-Ray Mirror Metrology Station.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to post and respond to questions from industry.  The questions and answers to the questions are as follows: A.  Question: There is repeated reference to a measurement accuracy (or, equivalently, a "fine radial motion" accuracy") of 0.01 micron (10 nm) rms.  We understand that this clearly applies within each separate axial scan measurement of the test piece.	Our question is whether there are separate requirements from scan to scan.  Specifically, we ask whether there are separate requirements for the measurement of	 1. the average end-to-end slope among the axial scans	  (or "delta-radius");	   2. the variation of end-to-end slope among the axial scans    (or "delta-delta-radius"); and     3. the variation of average radius among the axial scans (or "roundness"). Response: 1. As a point of information -- if the two ends of the scan are off by 10 nm, in opposite directions (worst direction, 1 sigma statistics), over the full 200 mm scan, the corresponding angle error is 20 nm / 200 mm = 0.1 microradian ~ 0.02 arcsecond.  2. The questions above can be answered by reference to our Constellation-X angular resolution error budget; the corresponding error allocations for errors #'s 1-3 above are documented. If (conservatively) we budget 1/16th of this error for a metrology contribution, and taking into account that we root-sum-square to combine terms in the error budget [for example, if terms a and b are equal, their sum is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(2) * a, NOT 2* a], the following error allocations for the terms listed above result: 2.1. The average end to end slope error would also be called the 'cone angle error' and is allocated 2.5 arcsecond rms; this could be calculated from the derivative of the axial scans with respect to axial position (slope). 2.2. The variation of end-to-end slope among the axial scans would be called delta-delta-radius and is allocated 0.125 arcsecond rms; this also would be calculated from the derivative of the axial scan with respect to axial position. 2.3 The variation of average radius would also be called roundness and is allocated 0.75 microns (750 nm). Averaging of successive axial scans in the azimuthal direction, if there are sufficient of them, is permissible if it helps reduce noise and if the resulting average can still have 2 degree (~ 1/30th of the azimuthal width) resolution on the part under measurement with the time frame in the statement of work. B.  Question: We have identified yet some technical points that could impact the cost of the measuring system and we need the following additional information : -confirm that the object (mirror) to be measured shall not move during measurement and that it is as close as possible maintained vertically to avoid deformations  -confirm that, as consequence of the previous item, it is the axis of the cone that is tilted with respect to the vertical direction (i.e. Z' is the theoretical axis of the cone) Response: - we strongly prefer that the part not move during measurement; otherwise offerers must design in a very low vibration system and take responsibility for movement of the very thin part at the specified precision level. We expect this amounts to a requirement that the test object be stationary. - The preferred gravity orientation of the part is "near" vertical, i.e. with the gravity vector parallel to the axis of the cone. Thus Z' is a motion parallel to the cone surface, and Z (vertical) should be antiparallel to gravity. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 11/12/03. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 11/12/03. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, (the Company), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), for management and operation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is requesting proposals from prospective suppliers to provide support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications. This Request For Proposal (RFP) is being offered on behalf of the Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies. To achieve the goal of increasing vehicle fuel economy while maintaining cost targets, future power electronics must meet the following requirements: reductions in size, weight, and manufacturing costs. Additionally, reliable operation and improvements in efficiency under increased temperatures and rugged environmental conditions must be achieved. New technological advances must be initiated to realize these objectives. Innovative designs and manufacturing methods must be pioneered to take power electronics to the "next level" while maintaining cost goals. The Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies is offering this RFP to foster technologies to reduce a growing dependency on oil and continually elevating pollution levels. It is being issued in close coordination with the domestic automotive industry with the goal of developing and demonstrating significant technological advancements at low production costs. It is broken into two subtopics for consideration. A. SUBTOPIC I The ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a System on a Chip (SoC) motor controller for use in a broad range of applications such as hybrid and fuel cell-based vehicles. Today's motor controller technology revolves around commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs). These chips are able to perform the complicated high-speed mathematical functions necessary for motor control. In some cases, DSP manufacturers have included additional circuitry within the chip, specifically for use in control applications. However, external circuitry is still required to accomplish all the functions necessary for efficient motor control. This specification outlines the functional and performance requirements for a traction motor controller SoC. The proposed architecture is intended to achieve cost reduction through the integration of functions and inclusion of necessary external circuitry within a single semiconductor device. Additionally, cost reduction will be realized by the development of a flexible modular control system suitable for use with drive systems of varying power levels. Through the reduction in parts count and manufacturing efforts, it is hoped a cost reduction of 40 to 60% of a conventional controller board can be realized in high volume production. It is anticipated that this project will be separated into two phases. Phase I will involve a detailed cost study and analysis of potential processes and packaging methods to meet the specific requirements of a Statement of Work. Technological innovations will be highly encouraged. A detailed development plan, power budget, and cost analysis for production quantities of 100,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000 must be presented. A viable path to commercialization along with a schedule must be included. A comprehensive report on all activities and accomplishments made during Phase I will be delivered to ORNL. A proposed schedule of the development effort will be established along with major milestones. The second phase of the project will involve the design, simulation, and synthesis of the chip. It is anticipated that these awards may support efforts for a project period of up to two years. B) SUBTOPIC II This ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a high voltage to isolated, DC-to-DC converter for use in hybrid and fuel cell based vehicles. It is a requirement that the converter be designed and fabricated with a baseline 14V output capable of supplying 5kW. An additional 42V output is a highly desirable option, and its inclusion in the proposal is at the discretion of the Seller(s). For the dual output converter (42V/14V) the 14V power requirement shall be 3kW and the 42V output shall be capable of supplying 5kW. The Statement of Work (SOW) will detail the requirements for both 14V and 42V converter outputs. The Seller will design and fabricate an isolated DC-to-DC converter per the specifications. A detailed cost analysis will be performed by the Seller discussing design trade offs with cost considerations. The cost study will identify any critical or key costing issues. The study shall include projections of costs for annual production volumes of 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 units. A viable path to production must be demonstrated. A cost objective of $75/kW has been targeted with volume and weight goals of 5 liters and 6 kg, respectively. Technical barriers will be discussed with potential solutions. Any issues concerning the use of the proposed technology relevant to a vehicle application will be identified. The design will take into account an expected lifetime of 15 years or 150,000 miles. A minimum of four (4) packaged converters will be delivered at the conclusion of the project to ORNL for evaluation. The testing of the deliverable hardware will be undertaken to validate the design and verify readiness for use in a vehicle. It is anticipated that this project will last up to three years. A detailed RFP has been issued for the scope to be subcontracted, including specific qualification requirements. An Offeror may elect to bid on one or both subtopics as further described in the RFP. Please direct your requests for receipt of the RFP to Christine M. Sullivan by e-mail (sullivancm@ornl.gov) or fax (865)241 -2426.                                                          BID CLOSING DATE OCTOBER 7, 2003 - SUPTOPIC-I (SYSTEM ON A CHIP)                                                         SUBTOPIC II-(DC/DC CONVERTER)  BID CLOSING DATE NOVEMBER 14, 2003 DUE TO CHANGE IN THE QUALIFICATION CRITERIA.   THE REQUIREMENT FOR ISO CERTIFICATION HAS BEEN DELETED FROM THE QUALIFICATION CRITERIA.  Original Point of Contact : Christine M.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to (1) provide a revised DHS SPIRIT acquisition milestone schedule, (2) provide a revision to the anticipated labor category strategy for SPIRIT contracts and an updated list of the anticipated core labor categories for each functional area, and (3) provide an update on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Due to the complexities and size of this project, preparation of the Request for Proposal (RFP) and associated procurement documents has taken longer than originally planned.  In addition, the issues with the 8(a) strategy have not yet been resolved with SBA.  DHS SPIRIT acquisition milestones have been revised as follows:  The RFP is anticipated to be released no earlier than January 5, 2004 with proposals being due February 23, 2004.  Contracts are anticipated to be awarded in June 2004.  Contractors will be required to propose on government identified core labor categories for each functional area in which they are competing.  The list of core labor categories for each functional area has been expanded.  Contractors will no longer need to propose additional labor categories as part of their proposal for SPIRIT contracts.  However, should additional labor categories be required to propose on individual task orders subsequent to SPIRIT contract awards, the SPIRIT Contracting Officer will conduct the necessary negotiations with SPIRIT contract holders. We have been advised that the problems some contractors have been experiencing with the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) have been corrected.  However, if you continue to experience difficulties with ORCA, please let us know immediately.  The information on ORCA as provided in a previous SPIRIT FedBizOpps update is repeated here for your reference.  ORCA will be used to retrieve offerors annual Representations and Certifications (Section K of the RFP) for this acquisition.  An abridged Section K will be included in the solicitation for contract-specific and/or agency-specific Representations and Certifications, if applicable.  ORCA can be accessed using the Business Partner Network (BPN) web site:  www.bpn.gov.  There is a direct link to ORCA on the left of the BPN home page.  Select either Vendor or Public, and then select Help to access the ORCA Handbook, Frequently Asked Questions, and the ORCA Background.  All further SPIRIT project information, including the RFP, will be posted on this site as it becomes available.  We will also post a notice ten days before the actual release of the RFP.   Thank you for your continued interest and your patience.  CONTRACTORS NOTE:  DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT, NO QUESTIONS OR ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS REGARDING THE DHS SPIRIT PROJECT ARE BEING ACCEPTED.  E-MAILS OR TELEPHONIC INQUIRIES RECEIVED WILL NOT BE ADDESSED.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, and materials to support the commercial flooring requirements, exclusive of residential flooring, for Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho facilities.  The materials and services to be provided by the contractor shall be of the best available quality as outlined in the solicitation and statement of work.  Materials and labor to be provided include, but are not limited to, carpet, tile, sheet vinyl, cove base, wood base, installation and removal of listed materials, floor repair, and trimming of provided doors.  This solicitation shall result in a firm-fixed priced requirements type contract that shall consist of a base year and four one-year options.  The government anticipates recurring requirements but cannot predetermine the precise quantities that designated government activities will need during a definite period.  The government intends to fill all actual purchase requirements for supplies and/or services by placing orders with the contractor within the scope of the contract.  Because the government may encounter unforeseen conditions under old flooring, additional supplies and/or services may be added to the contract.  Such additions shall be added by bilateral modifications.  If potential contractors submitted proposals for solicitation F10603-03-R-0003 which was cancelled, new and complete proposals must be submitted for this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 314110.  This NAICS code is waivered under the nonmanufacturing rule and offerors are not required to purchase materials supplied under this contract from a small business as required by the nonmanufacturing rule.  Therefore, this acquisition is set-aside 100% for small business.  Solicitation documents will be made available on or about 15 September 2003. The fax number listed in this notice is incorrect and should be 208-828-2658.

<DESC>Amendment 0001: This amendmment is being issued to provide additional information. Description of group of students attending the courses: All highly skilled Masters or PHD level researchers with experience in Fortran, mostly C, and 5-10 years programming experience.  Some of the students are totally new to MATLAB and want the basics, while others are experienced users who want more depth.  The focus of the training is to be both on a) the basic and intermediate features of Matlab, and b) how to go about using Matlab to solve specific scientific/engineering problems.  The classrooms will be set up for each course with a computer loaded with the Matlab application for every one or two students.  There is no need for coverage of Simulink.  The courses are expected to be taught consecutively with 2 days spent on each, for a total of 4 days.  Training is to be heavily hands-on (at least 50%).  Desired MATLAB training topics and questions from those wanting training: 1.  A good explanation of the very basics of Matlab, 2. Functions that allow linking to external libraries if not covered  by "MEX", 3. Graphics and mapping data with geography background or mapping data on world coordinates with different map projections, 4. SSA (singular spectrum analysis), 5. How to transform an existing data series file to an application of the Matlab (In many cases of using a commercial software for statistical analysis there is a need to estimate how much time is needed to spend on the data input for a task before making a decision of whether to use a commercial software or write an alternative or modify an existing one in the UNIX environment.), 6. Signal Analysis Toolbox, Methods of time series analysis (bivariate): a) How to compute 'gain' from  input and output signals  b) How to compute cross amplitude c) interpretation of power spectral density plots, 7. Wavelet toolbox: a) basic intro to the mechanics of wavelet analysis b) interpretation of scalograms c) interpretation of wavelet scale d) confidence intervals and wavelets. How to evaluate the strength of the wavelet coefficients in a scalogram? (since they represent a 'goodness of fit' between  the signal and the wavelet), 8. Strings and Cells. (Closes Amendment 0001). This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with FAR parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number WC4-00004 is issued as a request for quotation.

<DESC>NA The FAAs Oceanic and Offshore Integrated Product Team is in need of a provider for Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) Waypoint Reporting (WPR) Services in the New York Oceanic Flight Information Region (KZWY). This service is currently provided at a fixed price by ARINC Inc., in a contractual arrangement that will expire in February 2004.  The ADS WPR service shall provide the New York Oceanic Center with automated aircraft position report data derived from ADS Waypoint reports by aircraft equipped with the Future Air Navigation System (FANS) 1/A package. These ADS position reports are received via an ADS contract established between the service provider and participating FANS 1/A aircraft. The service provider must then convert the ADS waypoint position reports into ICAO 4444 position report format, and transmit the converted position report to KZWY via the AFTN network. Minimum technical and performance requirements include:  	A datalink system capable of FANS1/A AFN logon, AFN address forwarding and ADS Waypoint contract capability with equipped aircraft.  	The ability to convert received ADS Waypoint position reports to ICAO 4444 position report format and transmit the converted position reports to up to 3 FAA selected AFTN addresses simultaneously.  	The service must provide the ability to configure service areas geographically to encompass the KZWY datalink service area. This area covers the New York FIR excluding the WATRS area. A detailed map of the data link service area is available via email or fax upon request. 	The service must be capable of at least 150 simultaneous ADS contracts, and must be able to transmit receive, convert and transmit up to 200 ADS waypoint reports per hour.  	The ADS WPR service must be available 99.9% of the time. 	 The service must support end-to-end testing with the New York Center and the W.J. Hughes Technical Center prior to commencement of live operations. 	The service must provide an offline testing capability for test activities after the commencement of live operations. 	Technical support and troubleshooting services must be available 24/7.  	The service provider must submit system usage information at least monthly, or by FAA request detailing message traffic, aircraft logon statistics and system outage information.  	Service providers must have demonstrable experience in the management of FANS1/A datalink services. As a critical condition, the service must be available for end-to-end operational testing with the FAA no later than January 1, 2004. The service must be available to commence live operations in the New York Flight Information Region not later than February 1, 2004.  The period of service for this effort will begin with the commencement of live operations on February 1, 2004 for no less than 6 months with options for extension beyond the initial service period on a month-to-month basis. With the implementation of the FAAs Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) system at New York, the service will be discontinued, as ADS WPR services will no longer be an FAA requirement. This announcement is for the express purpose of identifying qualified vendors. Qualified vendors are requested to provide documentation detailing how they will meet the FAAs minimum technical and performance requirements cited in this announcement. Only those vendors determined by the FAA to be qualified will be given the opportunity to compete for this award. Technical, business management, past experience and cost proposals will be required as part of the next phase of the down-select process. Responses must be submitted not later than 2.00pm, November 17, 2003.

<DESC>NASA/HQ is hereby issuing this sources sought synopsis for meeting NASA's upcoming requirement for establishment of the International Space Station (ISS) Research Institute (ISSRI)with a non-government organization (NGO).	The purpose of the ISSRI is to provide research, leadership and advocacy for utilization of the ISS by the U.S. Science, Technology and Commercial (S/T/C) communities.  The ISSRI contractor is expected to foster and extend S/T/C research community interest and support for ISS utilization.  The ISSRI will develop the constituencies for use of U.S. ISS research facilities in alignment with NASA strategic objectives.   The website at	 http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov/research_projects/ngo.html       provides information about the plans for an ISS NGO.       The NAIS Code for this requirement is 541710. NASA intends to award to an educational institution (or consortium of institutions), or other nonprofit organization (an organization that meets the definition of "institution of higher education" under 20 U.S.C. 1001 or is exempt from income taxes under 26 U.S.C. 501). NASA anticipates that for-profit organizations will participate as subcontractors, but not as the prime contractor. NASA is seeking interested companies with specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements.  Additionally, NASA seeks capabilities of small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.   Interested offerers are requested to provide name, phone and address of firm, detailed information demonstrating their understanding of the work requirements identified above as well as their qualifications, capabilities, experience and past performance history for such work. All submissions are limited to 25 pages or less.    No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This requirement is not to be considered a commercial or commercial-type product as defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   All responses shall be submitted to Ms. Doris Wood at Doris.S.Wood@nasa.gov no later than 15 days after the posted date of this synopsis and should reference MRKT-RES-RFP10-07206-215. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (DESPR/NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations having the ability to establish a longitudinal cohort study in an attempt to determine whether reproductive hormone fluctuationmediated oxidative stress alterations, which are observed across the menstrual cycle, play a role in reproductive health and disease.  Recent animal and human studies suggest that oxidative stress might be implicated in the risk of female infertility through associations with follicular growth, the development of endometriosis, and regulation of angiogenesis in the endometrium, but the mechanisms are not completely understood.  Although it is known that micronutrient antioxidants, hormones, and enzymatic antioxidants are able to neutralize oxygen free radicals and inhibit oxidation, the use of these therapies to reduce the risk of infertility has been limited by a lack of basic understanding.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE: (i) to study the intra-cycle variation of oxidative stress during menstruation; (ii) to determine the relationship between sex-hormones and oxidative stress during the menstrual cycle in pre-menopausal women; (iii) to examine the influence of external factors such as over-the-counter medications, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise on oxidative stress and hormone levels; and (iv) to evaluate the validity and reliability of biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status in blood and urine.  To meet these objectives, a prospective longitudinal cohort study is being designed.  An estimated total of approximately 260 pre-menopausal, healthy (chlamydia-free) women will be required to participate in this study.   To receive consideration for a contract award, a small business must be able to: 1) Demonstrate a clear understanding of menstrual function and its relation to oxidative stress, including the potential role of environmental factors, biological variability and laboratory measurements; 2) Provide evidence of a solid understanding regarding the utility and feasibility of a longitudinal design for empirically assessing the relation between biomarkers of oxidative stress, lifestyle factors and human reproduction and development; and, 3) Provide evidence of an ability to: a) identify, recruit and retain participants; b) collect longitudinal data and biologic specimens using quality assurance procedures (include information on what quality assurance procedures have been/will be used); and c) comply with an established study protocol in collaboration with the NICHD.  

AT THIS TIME, ONLY CAPABILITY STATEMENTS ARE BEING REQUESTED FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The required service is defined as code 541990 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  For the purposes of this announcement, a small business is defined as one that has revenues of <$5 MILLION.  Small businesses that believe that they have the ability to satisfy all of the above stated capabilities, and who meet the stated size standards, are encouraged to submit a capability statement to the address indicated above within 45 days of the publication of this announcement.

<DESC>NA NA DESC: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. There is no solicitation available at this time. Technical Data Package Listing (TDPL), Part Number 9348199 will be provided with the solicitation. Strict conformance to the requirements of the TDP is expecte d due to the U.S. Armys requirement for a reliable and accurate weapon system, that is standard, and interchangeable with the existing inventory.  The barrel is required to be rifled using a rotorary forge or rototary swagged.  The receiver is a weld ment with complex geometry.  In our experience robotic welding is essential to produce production quantities of receivers.  Several of the critical parts are made of steel specified on drawing, 11825998.  TACOM-ROCK ISLAND, in support of the Project Manage r for Soldier Weapons, is seeking to identify POTENTIAL SOURCES who have the capability to manufacture the M249 AUTOMATIC RIFLE (AR) WITH EQUIPMENT; NSN: 1005-01-127-7510, P/N: 9348199. A description of the M249 AR is as follows: The M249 AR is a gas opera ted, air-cooled, linked belt fed weapon that fires 5.56mm NATO standard ammunition from an open bolt position. It features a folding bipod, quick change barrel assembly with integral carrying handle and gas system, a feed cover (which allows closing of the  cover regardless of bolt position), bolt assembly, plastic buttstock, and an integral optical sight rail on the cover. Quantities are not known at this time, but it is anticipated that 900 - 1420 each, M249 ARs will be procured in FY04 under an Inde finite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The expected monthly production rate is 125 to 250 weapons. Interested sources shall inform the Government of the time frame that is required for them to produce First Article Production Weapons once th e contract is awarded. The US Government may require a quarterly reliability test. Sources Sought must have an adequate production capability and must also have a safe and secure storage area to store at least three (3) months of production guns at the qua ntities specified above. For security purposes, the M249 AR is considered Category II and the 5.56mm ammunition is Category IV. Any contract for these items will require security protective measures in accordance with DOD Regulation 5100.76-M, dated 12 Aug  2002, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives (AA&E), MIL-H-2918113, dated 10 May 1994, Military Specifications and the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) Regulation 3 1-1-M, Dated August 1991, Arms, Ammunition, and E xplosives (AA&E) Operating Manual. Bidders will have to provide proof that they meet all Federal Regulations for producing a fully automatic machine gun before they will be considered for any contracts for producing this weapon system. If and when a solici tation is issued for the purpose of price evaluation, the cost to Government for qualifying a new producer will be added to their proposal. The approximate cost to be added is $800,000. It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on or about Febru ary 2004. Interested sources should respond to Cathy Mendoza, email:  mendozac@ria.army.mil by 14 Nov 03, 3:45 p.m. central time.

The desired character istics for such a system (not in priority order) are as follows: (1) functions on current and future static line parachute systems including the current T-10C and MC1-1C main parachutes with the Modified Improved Reserve Parachute System (MIRPS), as well a s the Advanced Tactical Parachute System (ATPS) currently under development, (2) operates onboard high performance fixed wing, rotary wing, and non standard aircraft at speeds from 70 to 150 KIAS, (3) uses relative proximity of the aircraft in order to det ermine exit and separation from the aircraft prior to executing the reserve deployment criteria of evaluating descent rates, (4) must operate from exit altitudes of 600 ft above ground level or higher (threshold) and 375 ft above ground level or higher (ob jective), (5) must not interfere or influence any existing equipment with the exception of the reserve canopy and container and the jump platform, (6) System Reliability .995 reliability  at 95% confidence for total malfunctions where the canopy offers no lift (threshold), and with .99 reliability at 90% confidence for partial malfunctions (goal) while providing .995 reliability at 90% confidence that the system will not inadvertently activate (e.g., onboard the aircraft, during a towed jumper event, or und er a full-open main canopy), (7) system must allow for the ability to manually deploy reserve canopy with out changing current procedures, (8) cost of system from $300 (goal) to $500 (threshold). The science and technology effort in the area of applied research and experimental development being considered is on the order of  $500K - $700K per year for two years. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government.  All intere sted firms, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information. It should be noted that this is a market survey and not a pre-solicitation notice.  A pre-solicitation notice will be published if a formal solicitation is generated.

<DESC>NA The United States Military Academy seeks an experienced firm to design/build and install a primary scoreboard in Michie Stadium, an NCAA Division I football stadium consisting of the following segments: 1) traditional fixed scoreboard elements, 2) 14 mm Re d, Green, Blue (RGB) light emitting diode (LED) matrix board approximately 24 feet high by 42 feet wide, 3) advertising panels to be specified in combination or solely as tri vision panel, back lit or LED format, 4) covered video/television platform with e lectricity and conduit path to television compound in Holleder Center parking lot, 5) auxiliary scoreboards (score, time, down, distance, field position, quarter) on the north face of the new Randall Hall or another location such as the area underneath upp er deck, 6) equipment for operating video board to include layout, equipment, and power in Operations Booth of Hoffman Press Box, 7) removal of existing scoreboard.  All elements are to be installed in the North end zone of  Michie Stadium (seating capacit y of approximately 39,000).  All elements are to be operational by 1 August 2004 for the start of the 2004 football season.  The 2004 football season will begin approximately 1 September 2004. The scoreboard must have the capabilities of supporting graphic s, video, ads/logos, text, and traditional scoreboard elements such as changeable team names, score, time, time outs left, down, distance, ball on, yards to go, and quarter.  The boards will support intercollegiate football, lacrosse and selected academy e vents to include Plebe Reception Day (R Day), recruiting visits, graduation, and concert events.  The board will replace the existing scoreboard at north end zone.  Required features include:  High brightness; Enhanced video processor capability; Wide view ing angles; Rapid Screen Refresh; High resolution (picture clarity); Interchangeable Modular Assemblies; Accurate color rendering; Low maintenance with primary service from the front of the unit; RGB LED using a minimum 14 mm center-to-center spacing.  The  new existing scoreboard located at the south end of the stadium will remain in operation.  Contractor shall demonstrate the capability to operate the new scoreboard seamlessly with the existing south scoreboard and that all traditional scoreboard elements  (time, down, distance, etc) shall read identical to the new scoreboard.  A sound system will not be part of this project since a distributed system is currently under study and design.  The structure of the new scoreboard and video board may be required t o support the weight of attached  speakers.  The new scoreboard shall be located just above the stands in the north end zone.  It can be mounted on the existing steel structure if adequate, or if required, on a new steel structure to be built by the contra ctor.   The new scoreboard shall be connected to existing on site power supply and data connections to the new press box.  The board shall be operational NLT 1 August 2004 and will remain operational for all required intercollegiate/academy events from tha t date forward. The electrical supply is located adjacent to the current north scoreboard.  The power for the scoreboard and video board will be supplied from this electrical location.  Board design shall be appropriate to the setting in Michie Stadium, a historic structure located with the United States Military Academy, which is designated as a National Historic District.  The back side of the scoreboard faces a main thoroughfare on the Academy and therefore shall have a finished appearance on both sides that is sensitive to its military and historical setting.  Any design must compliment and blend into Michie Stadium area and the supporting stadium architecture as opposed to dominating it.  Interested offerors are invited to view the existing facilities d uring a game day environment of Michie Stadium on 15 November 2003 for the Army-Houston game, which starts at 1300 hours at the United States Military Academy a t West Point. Guests shall only be given two game tickets/credentials and one parking pass.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the solicitation.  The NAICS code is 541330 and the size standard for this requirement is $4M.  Solicitation 4MC4A301is issued as a Request for Quotation H94003-04-T-4001 and is sole source to EagleST, 3778 Eagle St, San Diego, CA, 92103.  This requirement is for UTSi Radiation Hardness and SiGe Assessment in accordance with Statement of Work DMEA04-4A7 dated 27 October 2003.  The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), located in Sacramento, CA, is under the authority, direction and control of the Deputy under Secretary of Defense for Logistics.  In addition to supporting numerous defense organizations, DMEA also supports other federal agencies, state governments, U.S. industries and foreign establishments.  The DMEA provides technologically correct and economically viable solutions to microelectronics obsolescence.  DMEAs engineering specialists, supported by complex design, analysis, test and prototyping equipment, produce solutions that are technically correct, logistically supportable, schedule responsive and fiscally affordable.
The Department of Defense (DOD) increasingly relies on the use of smart weapon systems.  The components that make up these systems are the complex microelectronics devices that form their brains.  Microelectronics technologies are extremely dynamic and, on the average, become obsolete every 18 months.  However, DOD weapon systems using such technologies have increased life cycles that commonly last for 40 or 50 years.  The disparity between the long life cycles for weapons systems and the short life of microelectronics technology sources is the main factor driving DoD system obsolescence and mission degradation.  DMEA has the responsibility of addressing these issues by using advanced technologies to extend the life of these systems.  DMEA provides form, fit, and/or function replacements of microelectronics and transitions new technology into systems through its Logistics Retrofit Engineering (LRE) program.  Development, production and test of radiation-hardened microelectronics using processes licensed to DMEA is a necessary component of this support.  As such, implementing these processes in ways which ensure specified levels of radiation-hardness or tolerance is of great importance.  This project is one part of a major research and development program at DMEA which incorporates many interrelated and interdependent projects.
The purpose of this task is to perform research, analysis, and testing efforts necessary for improving and assuring the radiation tolerance/hardness of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) processes currently being installed and to be installed in the DMEA flexible foundry.  Specific activities to be accomplished include: researching the impacts of implementing licensed processes into the flexible foundry on radiation tolerance and performance in the military environment; and developing the means by which these processes might be controlled, tested and hardened for better performance in strategic space radiation environments.
The contractor shall perform all tasks required to ensure that the program meets performance, cost and schedule requirements.  These shall include: scheduling of activities and deliverables; describing status; outlining contractor activity and progress toward accomplishing objectives; planning, program planning; describing the overall results of the effort; and documenting new technology breakthroughs; and any other management techniques deemed appropriate.  The contractor shall also report technical accomplishments, potential problem areas, results of conferences, and authorized directives from the contracting officer. The contractor shall designate a task manager who shall be directly responsible for all aspects described in this SOW. The task manager shall be the point of contact for the government. The Contractor shall maintain a status of their effort towards achieving the SOW objectives, including all technical activities and efforts, problems/deficiencies, impacts, recommended solutions, etc.  The contractor shall participate in Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) or technical reviews as required.  All such meetings shall be held at DMEA.  Certification by the Government of satisfactory services provided is contingent upon the contractors performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the referenced contract, the SOW, the approved proposal, and all amendments.
DMEA will provide the contractor with access to the DMEA Science and Engineering Gamma Irradiation Test (SEGIT) facilitys two Cobalt-60 irradiators and environmental test chambers on a non-interference basis as needed to complete the tasks specified herein.  Travel may be required during the conduct of this task.  Travel shall be approved upon task award.  Additional travel is authorized only upon written approval by the government.The contractor shall provide a quarterly status report of their effort towards achieving the task objectives, including all technical activities and efforts, conclusions made, expenditure of program funds, schedule, problems/deficiencies, impacts, and recommended solutions.  The contractor shall also participate in quarterly meetings with the government to review status.  (DI-MGMT-80368)  The contractor shall research and analyze the DMEA Flexible Foundry COTS UTSi process and develop improvements to ensure that parts produced using the process are capable of operating in strategic space radiation environments.  The contractor shall analyze current technology deficiencies and develop and evaluate new test procedures, process enhancements, and process control modules. The contractor shall research the radiation hardness of the DMEA Si-Ge process. The contractor shall also support the ongoing COTS BX/SN03 process hardening and hardness assurance activities. (DI-A-3027A)  Process Hardening and Hardness Assurance Research and Development.  The contractor shall research and recommend any additional process hardening techniques for the UTSi process that are necessary to make this process meet strategic space radiation hardness levels. The contractor shall research and identify which design, layout, and process parameters of these processes must be controlled and how tightly these need to be controlled (quantitatively) to provide strategic space hardness assurance on these processes with a minimum amount of radiation testing.  If necessary, the contractor shall develop a new process control module(s) for the UTSi process for radiation testing.  The contractor shall recommend specific design, layout, and process hardness assurance procedures to be implemented by a Technology Review Board to maintain hardness levels.  The contractor shall also provide a preliminary assessment of the radiation hardness potential of the DMEA PCB40 and SiGe processs and make preliminary recommendations on possible hardening and hardness assurance methods. (DI-MISC-80508)  The contractor shall provide updated technical guidance and support of developmental radiation testing activities.  Special materials shall be provided by the contractor when they are essential to the task performance and specifically approved by the PCO, not to exceed the ceiling price identified in the delivery order.  Contractor provides office equipment and expenses necessary to perform contractual services including printing, photocopying, communications, postage, express mail, paper and copying supplies, local and long distance telephone charges, and other equipment and supplies required in support of the contract.
