<DESC>NAICS CODE: 541712<br /><br />FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514<br /><br />TITLE: Multi-Source Analysis (MSA)<br /><br />ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement<br /><br />FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-13-04<br /><br />CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800<br /><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies, analytical tools, algorithm developments, projects, and experiments focused on developing Multi-Source, Activity-Based Analysis capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to better conduct Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). <br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The Processing and Exploitation Core Technical Competencies (CTC) mission is to lead the discovery, development, and application of technology to enable the processing and exploitation of multi-source ISR data for commanders, decision makers, and intelligence analysts. The volume of sensor data produced is enormous and still growing rapidly; however the ability to process and exploit this data has not been able to keep pace with the sheer volume of data produced. The Multi-Source Analysis (MSA) sub-CTC, which is the intended target of this Funding Opportunity, focuses on the creation of force multipliers for the ISR operators/analysts by developing automated processes to identify, extract, analyze, correlate, and sort multi-source data in order to classify and identify activities, entities and entity-relation networks in the battlespace. It also supports analysts in developing/maintaining more comprehensive situational awareness on an area of responsibility, as well as expertise on a topic in which they specialize. Multi-source exploitation and analysis capabilities are needed to turn data into information for the analyst. The key aspect is to provide automated capabilities to help the analyst more efficiently develop target sets, answer time-sensitive requests for information and produce intelligence analysis reports.<br /><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) has an established test-bed facility that provides evaluation, assessment and demonstration of intelligence tools. The Automated Processing and Exploitation (APEX) Center provides a facility for algorithm development and evaluation, analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises and demonstration of fusion technologies with real and simulated multiple source intelligence (multi-INT) data. Capabilities include scenario generation, and platform and sensor modeling. Simulators have been developed for various intelligence data types such as Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) information, electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). Highly developed multi-INT data fusion systems are available for application to the problem of ground target tracking against a variety of operational scenarios. Analytical tools that quantify established measures of performance (MOPs) are available for target tracking and other applications. In total the APEX Center helps to facilitate a broad range of intelligence capabilities, and fusion technology development.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE:<br /><br />The Information Directorate, Activity Based Analysis Branch, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for unique and innovative technologies to explore and develop network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capabilities that allows the fusion of multi-INT and data sources to enable accurate, shared, real-time intelligence products that locate and characterize entities, and tracks events, activities, and adversary networks. The key aspect is to provide automation capabilities for the analyst in the development of target sets and intelligence analysis reports. The three focus areas within MSA include: (1) Integrated Tracking, Analysis and Discovery (ITAD), (2) Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis, and (3) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Enterprise to the Edge (CETE). AFRL/RI intends to utilize the APEX Center capabilities to assist analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises, and the processing of real-world, multi-INT data. The availability or use of Government Furnished Property/Government Furnished Equipment (GFP/GFE) will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis, but no GFP/GFE is anticipated at this time. Any GFP/GFE required by the offerors must be clearly identified in the submitted white paper.<br /><br />Descriptions of Key Focus Areas:<br /><br />1. ITAD intends to enable the analyst's ability to collect, characterize and locate activities and transactions. This includes identifying and locating actors conducting the activities and transactions, the networks of these actors, the relationships between networks, and the development of patterns of life (spatial and temporal motion statistics). ITAD seeks to develop automated processing and exploitation capabilities for activity based detection, normalcy and wide-area motion statistics. There are two major areas under ITAD: Motion Exploitation (ME) and Activity-Based Intelligence (ABI). ME includes automatic tracking and activity detection. ABI includes patterns of life, motion-augmented link and network discovery, and activity characterization. The specific technology areas of interest under these areas include but are not limited to:<br /><br />Automatic Tracking is developing technology to perform continuous tracking of objects through the use of multi-intelligence feature and contextual data from similar and dissimilar domains. Performance must be optimized across sensor variations, target densities, real time/forensic operations, automatic/operator in the loop control, and operational scenarios. <br /><br />Activity Detection is developing automated techniques and tools to discover activity within the motion data (events, sequences, changes) to provide clues to analysts and for automated analysis. This spans individual activities (e.g. check point avoidance) through aggregate Area of Interest (AOI) -wide motion activities (e.g. traffic volume or full retreat). <br /><br />Wide Area Motion Statistics, characterizes and develops patterns of life in researching automated tools to exploit motion data including anomaly detection to characterize normalcy, finds origins and destinations, and relates statistical features to events.<br /><br />The Motion-Augmented Link and Network Discovery area develops algorithms to define and exploit multi-source networks representing adversary organizational structure and behavior. <br /><br />Activity Characterization is researching techniques to dynamically update the assessment of insurgent activity with the probable intent, phase of operation, location, timing and participants associated with observed or detected activities and events. This will characterize and assess detected activity by combining kinematic analysis with behavior analysis and social network analysis for enhanced and timely situational awareness (SA). <br /><br />AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the specific technology areas listed above. Advancements are required to optimize performance, algorithm development, researching techniques and develop automatic techniques and tools.<br /><br />2. Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis capabilities allow for the efficient and effective exploitation of information that is contained within large volumes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured textual data. These data sets are very challenging to exploit as they can include material from many different sources, languages, genres and domains of interest and can be so vast that the application of automated analysis and visualization tools is necessary to have a chance at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the content. Employing Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis capabilities greatly reduces the time it takes analysts to exploit these ever increasing volumes of textual data to produce reliable decision-making information. Addressing this textual data overload is a foundational component of the Secretary of Defense's "Data to Decisions" science and technology priority. The major areas within Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis include: (1) Entity, Event &amp; Relationship (EER) Extraction; (2) Association &amp; Resolution (A&amp;R); and (3) Analysis &amp; Visualization (A&amp;V). EER addresses the extraction of entities, events and relationships from open source text, messages, reports, social media and structured databases such as transactions, communications, social relationships, sightings, and organizational structures. A&amp;R deals with multi-source/document data association and resolution as well as consolidation and association of data across disparate information sources using techniques such as standardization, normalization and probabilistic reasoning techniques. A&amp;V is developing algorithms for analysis and visualization of entities, events and relationships as they change over time. Parallelizable batch and real time graph analytic algorithms and heuristics to derive and maintain graph measures, graph matching and graph bundling to identify semantic and structural equivalences, and graph mining to discover new patterns of interest. The specific technology areas of interest under these areas include but are not limited to:<br /><br />EER Extraction: Data preparation (e.g. document zoning), smart filtering (e.g. document and corpus summarization), extraction of explicit and non-explicit entities, events, relationships and their attributes, within document entity and event co-reference, exploitation of idiosyncratic text types (e.g. micro text), sentiment analysis, domain customization and native foreign language exploitation.<br /><br />A&amp;R: Cross source entity and event resolution, data source alignment, hard/soft fusion, and deception detection.<br /><br />A&amp;V: Social network analysis, network analytics, pattern discovery, scalable algorithms, and novelty detection.<br /><br />AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the technology areas listed above, and their effective application to meet operator/analyst needs. Advancements are required to increase the speed, scalability and accuracy of textual analysis; to provide a greater depth of understanding of textual content, effectively map and link multiple concepts and relationships to increase comprehension and coordinate the derived knowledge across multiple intelligence media.<br /><br />3. The C4ISR Enterprise to the Edge (CETE) program seeks innovative revolutionary solutions for processing closer to the sensors to minimize the latency of exploitation products associated with very high density and high throughput airborne sensors offsetting severe communication constraints by significant onboard computing capabilities. A strategic approach should take advantage of mission context and location specific exploitation, semi-automated and assistive methods to multiply analyst effectiveness and/or autonomous and dynamically steerable decision making algorithms. Fast and efficient summarization, indexing, storage, management, and delivery methods based on high performance computing are critical to this vision. Distributed computing models applicable to concurrent coordinated sensing, summarization of dynamic events, through multiple independently moving sensor platforms is critical to develop the next generation of persistent surveillance across large hostile areas. Evasive presence and opportunistic reach-back communication, and associated onboard processing are among the options. Future platforms will combine multiple independently moving passive and coordinated risk-managed active sensing including: video, hyperspectral, passive-radar, and quasi-passive multistatic synthetic aperture imaging, and must robustly address operations within a denied environment (Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)) through stand-off surveillance and autonomous operations, taking advantage of dynamic awareness derived from other sources (SIGINT). A combined advantage of sensor-persistence, on-board storage, on-board computing, and intelligent exploitation algorithms will offer a wide range of solutions to effectively meet the mission requirements. Major areas under CETE include Context-Based Exploitation Architecture Designs (CBEAD), Information Management (IM), adaptive methods of latency minimization, Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), Mapping of Key Algorithms on versatile architecture (MoKA) to deliver "code-once and run anywhere" capabilities. <br /><br />The CBEAD area will focus on context specific exploitation algorithms including intelligent ways of estimating resource requirements impacting onboard realization of such exploitation algorithms. <br /><br />MoKA area will focus on developing approaches to map algorithms to on board processors of varied computational resources. The objective is to ensure that the algorithms can be effectively implemented on-board a platform within size, weight, and power (SWaP) restrictions. Furthermore, the developed solutions are required to meet the data storage requirements, and utilize computing methods to exploit both long-duration persistent data, and short-duration tactical data, while smartly adapting the computational effort to the required throughput. <br /><br />The IM area is to ensure that the algorithms utilize big data solutions (e.g. Multidimensional Integrated Ontology (MDIO) and Managed Information Object (MIO)) that balance expressiveness with resource limitations. The IM effort will insure that the information produced by CETE can be effectively distributed across multisensory and multimodal assets, intelligently leverage database solutions and quickly disseminate products to a broad user community.<br /><br />The CBIR area is focused on developing exploitation algorithms that can detect, track, and identify targets of interest, monitor regions of interest, measure patterns of life, etc. from standoff-sensors. The intent is for the algorithm to be agnostic to the platform and sensor specifics and to produce low-bandwidth products that can be efficiently disseminated in real time to a broad user community. Method designs should push processing closer to the sensor to eliminate communication latency constraints, improve salient content, and enable robust mission solutions.<br /><br />AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the specific technology areas listed above and will span various maturity levels. Advancements are required to increase the speed of image-based analysis, provide a greater depth of understanding of image-based content, effectively map and link multiple concepts and relationships to increase comprehension and coordinate the derived knowledge across multiple intelligence media.<br /><br />Solutions proposed for the above three areas will undergo testing, evaluation, integration, and verification in the APEX Center. The facility may be used to perform analysis for all efforts proposed under this BAA. The overall mission is to understand, measure, and advance the state of technology in the fusion of information. Offerors should consider any potential advancements that may be required for the APEX Center to support this BAA's 3 focus areas. If specialized modeling and simulation, scenarios for testing, analytical tools, algorithm developments, or new evolving metrics and evaluation standards are required in order for the Government to perform tasks within the APEX Center, include that information within the white paper. <br /><br />II.

Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: (a) Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; (b) Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and (c) Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. <br /><br />3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>

<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive. Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award. Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.<br />21.

It is the intention of the Government that the procurement shall be restricted to Savit Corporation, Rockaway, NJ and Design West Technologies, Tustin, CA, as they are the only two companies that have the capability to produce and deliver the M819 GAM within the time required. The award shall be for the purchase of 14,560 ea M819 GAM's with deliveries beginning in April 2014.  Offerors must be able to produce and deliver 5,000 GAM's in April 2014, 5,000 GAM's in May 2014 and 4,560 GAM's in June 2014.  The Invitation for Sealed Bids is intended to be issued under restricted competition using 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), Only One Responsible Source or a Limited Number of Responsible Sources. The USG intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price contract.  <br>  <br> The GAM consists of a plastic circular housing filled with two packets of a chemical adsorbent.  The plastic housing is made of high impact polystyrene and has an approximate height of 1.85 inches, approximate outer diameter (OD) of 3.1 inches, and approximate inner diameter (ID) of 2.3 inches.    The plastic housing is divided into two interlocking pieces.  Each piece consists of an upper and lower housing.  Two halves are then combined to make the entire housing.  The halves are held together with a piece of identifying tape with a warning printed on it.  The housing holds two Tyvek bags containing the commercially available phosphine adsorbent.  Each bag is held inside the housing with two packet retainers.  The retainers are made of Melt Processable Rubber (MPR) and are approximately 1.68 inches tall, with a cross-section of .265 inches by .335 inches.  Additionally they contain a C notch to retain the edge of the bag. <br>  <br>  <br> This notice does not constitute issuance of an Invitation for Sealed Bids, nor is the Government obligated to issue one.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice:  The US Army Contracting Command, Rock Island IL (ACC-RI) has a requirement for a cross flow membrane filtration cleaner recycling system for use on the aqueous degreaser at Crane Army Ammunition Activity.  The system will continuously filter the process solution and return the cleaned solution to the wash tank and collect the contaminated solution for disposal.  The system will bring about the separation of emulsified oils and, where present, high molecular weight, colloidal or suspended solids from water-based cleaning solutions. The mechanism that enables separation is a semi-permeable TIO2 membrane on a 316L SS substructure. When recycling aqueous wash solution, contaminated cleaner is pumped at relatively low pressure (typically less than 120 PSI) across the surface of the membrane. Materials larger than the size of the membrane pore, oils and suspended solids are retained and concentrated within the washer's process tank, while water and low molecular weight constituents, like the cleaner's surfactant/detergent components, can pass through the membrane to return to the wash bath. Installation and operating instructions shall be included.  The contractor will provide start up assistance and instruction for operators.  This assistance will occur at initial start-up, and is expected to require a period of one day.  FOB is Destination.   Salient characteristics and minimum requirements will be stated in the solicitation.  Solicitation W52P1J-14-T-3002 will be issued approximately 15 Nov 2013, with proposals due approximately 30 days from issue.  The solicitation and amendments will be posted via the Internet at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ and http://www.bfo.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to check these sites daily for posted amendments or other changes.  The solicitation will be a 100 percent small business set aside, and will result in award of a firm fixed price contract.  Contractors providing supplies or services to the Department of Defense shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ or contact Service Desk URL:  http://www.FSD.gov 866-606-8220 (8AM-8PMN Eastern Time).  This solicitation requires online certifications and representations (ORCA) found at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  Failure to complete the ORCA registration may make an offeror ineligible for award.

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), has a requirement to support a Phase I Clinical Trial Unit for Therapeutics Against Infectious Diseases in order to move promising therapeutic candidates into the clinical pipeline; such studies are often on the critical path for product development. <br /><br /><strong>Description </strong><br />Research supported and conducted by the NIAID, NIH, DHHS, strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The DMID supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics that is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.<br />The evaluation of new and improved vaccine and therapeutic candidates in clinical trials and clinical studies is an essential element of the efforts of DMID. Through an extensive network of grant and contract research programs, DMID supports a broad range of clinical research, including single-site and multi-center Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and Phase IV clinical trials of bacterial, viral and parasitic vaccines, therapeutics, and other biologics and drugs as preventive and therapeutic measures against infectious diseases in people of all ages and risk categories.  Support is also provided for a variety of other studies, including: targeted surveillance for pathogens of interest; reevaluation of current vaccine formulations, schedules and modes of delivery; and evaluations of novel investigational product delivery systems.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DMID also supports substantial preclinical research efforts to develop new therapeutics or find additional uses for already approved therapies.  These efforts, as well as efforts by many other organizations, produce promising therapeutic candidates that are appropriate for testing in humans in Phase I clinical trials.  First-in-human Phase I clinical trial data of new therapeutic agents provides important safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) information needed to determine how best to proceed with product development.  Other Phase I clinical trials provide important data on drug-drug interactions and food effects.  In addition, pharmacokinetic analysis of already licensed therapeutics in new populations, or in combination with other compounds, can help better define treatment guidelines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Phase I studies are often on the critical path for product development, the ability to prepare protocols and execute trials in a timely manner is important.  To help meet these goals and move promising candidates into the clinical pipeline in a timely manner, NIAID awarded contracts for the Phase I Clinical Trial Unit for Therapeutics Against Infectious Diseases (Phase I Unit) in 2008 under contracts HHSN272200800024C and HHSN272200800026C.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NIAID is conducting an acquisition to recompete the Phase I Unit research program requirements to continue to provide DMID with the infrastructure necessary for the design and conduct of Phase I clinical trials for therapeutics.  The scope of activities to be performed by the Contractor shall encompass all aspects of the design, development, implementation, and conduct of Phase I clinical trials to assess safety, pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics, of licensed and investigational therapeutic products, including immunomodulatory agents and monoclonal antibodies, against infectious diseases, including viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal pathogens and toxins.  The types of trials conducted, or planned, include first-in-human small molecule and monoclonal antibody trials, corrected QT interval (QTc) trials, and drug-drug interaction trials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DMID anticipates awarding Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with an ordering period of seven (7) years.  The anticipated start date is on/or about December 1, 2014. It is anticipated that Task Orders for specific tasks within each of the following Task Areas will be issued after award of the IDIQ contracts:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Task Area A:</strong> Administrative and Overall Clinical Operations Support and Concept Development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Task Area B:</strong> Protocol Development, Implementation, Conduct, Data Analysis, Completion, and Laboratory Analysis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />This information is furnished to potential offerors for information purposes only and is not to be considered restrictive for proposal purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by NIAID in response to the posting of an Request for Proposals (RFP).   The RFP will be available electronically on/about November 15th 2013, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Directions for proposal submission will be included in the RFP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This notice does not commit the Government to actually posting an RFP nor to the award of a contract.  Contact with Government personnel, other than the following points of contact, by a potential offeror or its employees' regarding this acquisition is strictly prohibited.

<SUBJECT>Fatigue Improvement of the Nose Landing Gear Downlock Attachment Area
<SOLNBR>N00019-11-G-0001-101X
<RESPDATE>103113
<CONTACT>Vicki W Dean, Phone (301) 757-1263, Fax (301) 757-2296, Email vicki.dean@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Sole Source Delivery Order with The Boeing Company, 6200 JS McDonnell Blvd., St. Louis, MO, for an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), to provide for the fatigue improvement of the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) Downlock Attachment area of the NLG abutment structure, develop a Technical Directive for the incorporation of the designed improvement, and all modification drawings and drawing changes necessary to support the ECP implementation.
<p><br />Boeing ECP 331 has been established to replace the Frame 11 on the AV-8B aircraft and the Frame 11 with abutment fitting for the TAV-8B aircraft. The next critical area of the NLG Abutment Structure has been determined to be the NLG Downlock Attachment to the drag beams. A fatigue life tracking algorithm was developed for the Downlock. Boeing previously designed / analyzed a fatigue improvement to this critical area. A question arose about being able to install the proposed solution while the assembly is installed. Using a scrapped fuselage to review the accessibility determined that the proposed improvement could not be installed on the NLG Abutment Structure while installed in the fuselage. However, since ECP-331 will remove the NLG Abutment structure from all affected aircraft, the area can be modified while on the alignment fixture. This ECP will be installed concurrent with ECP-331.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of Title 10, U.S.C. Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." A determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>This effort entails the design, development, testing and production of modification kit components for a fleet of over 125 Vertical/Short Take-off and Landing fighter-attack aircraft. The U.S. Government does not own the rights to, or possess the level three drawing package required to effect the development of this Engineering Change Proposal for the installation of this modification. The Harrier was originally developed by Hawker-Siddeley of the United Kingdom (now BAES) which has declined to sell/release legacy proprietary design data to the US Government. The AV-8B is a further joint development of the Harrier accomplished in partnership with McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing), which is built upon significant elements of the original Hawker-Siddeley design. Therefore, the Government is unable to obtain or provide a sufficient data package to enable third party accomplishment of this effort.</p>
<p>Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort described above.

<CONTACT>William A. Woodring, Contracting Specialist, Phone 2156979644, Fax 2156979569, Email william.woodring@navy.mil
<DESC>The Philadelphia Office of the U.S. Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk Contracting Department intends to purchase voluntary education programs for U.S. Armed Forces in the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) and the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) Areas of Responsibility (AORs) in support of the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES), under the Department of the Navy, Naval Education and Training Command. Required educational support includes operating Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) CENTCOM &amp; AFRICOM on-site National Test Centers (NTCs) while providing a range of undergraduate liberal arts degree programs and graduate degree programs in computer/information science/cyber security, counseling/personnel services, homeland security/criminal justice, and public administration. A minimum of 50% of courses under these academic programs must be taught on-site/face-to-face (100% of program core courses) at OCONUS CENTCOM &amp; AFRICOM Army Education Centers, Air Force Education Centers, and Navy College Offices throughout CENTCOM &amp; AFRICOM. Foreign countries under CENTCOM/AFRICOM include Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt(Sinai), Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, &amp; The United Arab Emirates. Supported locations are subject to change and are not necessarily the only locations that will require support throughout the period of performance of a subsequent contract; contract performance in a contingency area such as Afghanistan requires contractor Theater Business Clearance (TBC). All programs/courses must be taught by a post-secondary academic institution regionally accredited for face-to-face undergraduate &amp; graduate courses and regionally or nationally accredited for distance learning courses. The academic institution must be recognized by the U.S. Department of Education; must be a member of Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges (SOC) and participate in SOC Army Degrees (SOCAD), SOC Navy Degrees (SOCNAV), SOC Marine Corps Degrees (SOCMAR), &amp; SOC Coast Guard Degrees (SOCCOAST); must be a Letter of Intent (LOI) school with the Army's GoArmyEd program; and must agree to the new Department of Defense (DoD) Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) &amp; have a signed copy of same on-file with DoD before Service members can receive tuition assistance for enrolling in programs/courses required for delivery under a subsequent contract. The academic institution must maintain a management/administrative headquarters within thirty (30) miles of the DANTES European Advisor Office in Germany that is staffed by institutional management &amp; administrative personnel with educational and experiential backgrounds comparable to those required for similar positions of responsibility at the institution's home campus in the United States. Additionally, the academic institution must station an administrative level employee at the DANTES European Advisor Office to act as a liaison between the academic institution and the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) of a subsequent contract. Assimilation of the academic institution under Article 71 of the Supplementary Agreement to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) is a pre-requisite to the issuance of necessary DoD identification cards to personnel assigned to the management/administrative headquarters of the academic institution in Germany. This acquisition is being processed pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." University of Maryland University College, the incumbent provider of the requirement, is considered the only source with the necessary institutional knowledge, academic/technical expertise, physical infrastructure, and personnel resources to provide the required breadth of postsecondary education programs and education support services at OCONUS locations in the CENTCOM/AFRICOM AOR, including contingency areas. All other responsible sources may submit concise documentation for consideration regarding their ability to provide the required educational support, as well as financial and technical information. However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Furthermore, no award will be made on the basis of information received in response to this notice and the Navy will not pay for any information provided. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not competitive procurement is a possibility. Such information, if submitted, should be forwarded to NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083, to the attention of W. A. Woodring, Code 290.2B, and reference acquisition control number 2014-0055. If no affirmative written responses advantageous to the Navy are received within fifteen (15) calendar days after publication of this notice, University of Maryland University College will be solicited to provide the required educational support. The placement of a requirements contract is contemplated with a period of performance of 1 February 2014 through twelve (12) months thereafter, with two (2) option years. The applicable Product Service Code (PSC) and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code are U009 &amp; 611310, respectively. If this procurement were competed, no additional synopsis would be published and a request for quotation would only be forwarded to the intended vendor and firms that responded to this synopsis of intent.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT
<p>General Services Administration (GSA) seeks to lease the following space:<br /> <br />State:	Virginia<br />County:	Fairfax and Prince William<br />City:	Lorton<br />Delineated Area:	<br />North - Lorton exit on I-95<br />South - Southern border of the Prince William County line<br />East - within two (2) miles of I-95<br />West - within two (2) miles of I-95<br />Sq. Ft. (ABOA) Minimum:	37,028<br />Sq. Ft. (ABOA) Maximum:	37,398<br />Sq. Ft. (RSF):	37,398<br />Space Type:	Warehouse, with an office component.<br />Parking :	36 on site spaces<br />Full Term:	10 years<br />Firm Term:	5 years<br />Option Term:	5 years<br />Additional Requirements:	Subleases are not acceptable.</p>
<p>Of the 37,398 RSF required, approximately 7,090 RSF is office space.</p>
<p>Warehouse/Office ratio: Approximately 80/20.</p>
<p>Parking: Of the required 36 parking spaces, four (4) spaces will be used for large CDL trucks and two (2) will be designated for Official Government vehicles.</p>
<p>The entire warehouse and office space shall be heated; the office space only requires air conditioning.</p>
<p>Warehouse ceiling clear height shall be at least 20 feet.</p>
<p>A minimum of eight (8) loading docks; two (2) of the docks must have a dock leveler and two (2) must have a ramp which will allow a 24 foot long commercial truck entry.  The loading dock roll-up doors, and site circulation access, shall accommodate the height, width, length and turning radius of a tractor with a 55'-0" trailer; roll-up doors shall measure, at a minimum, 14 feet tall and 12 feet wide.<br /> <br />The Government intends to use this information from prospective sources to issue a Request For Proposal.</p>
<p>The Government currently occupies leased warehouse and related space that will be expiring on July 31, 2013.</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must have the ability to meet all current Federal/GSA/PBS, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, handicapped accessibility, OSHA, and sustainability standards by the required occupancy date per the terms of the Lease.  The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest must be received in writing no later than December 7, 2012 at 5:00 PM EST and should include the following information at a minimum:</p>
<p>&bull;	Building name and address;<br />&bull;	Location of space in the building and date of availability;<br />&bull;	Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rate per RSF;<br />&bull;	ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet and rental rate per ABOA, full service inclusive of a Tenant Improvement allowance of $6.70 / ABOA SF, meeting GSA's standard building shell requirements;<br />&bull;	Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space;<br />&bull;	Evidence of ability to meet the required occupancy date of no later than November 30, 2013;<br />&bull;	Site plan showing parking area(s) and loading area(s);<br />&bull;	Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers, or agents may offer space for consideration. Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>Projected Dates:</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest Due:	December 7, 2012<br />Market Survey (Estimated):	December 20, 2012<br />Offers Due (Estimated): 	January 31, 2013 <br />Occupancy (Estimated):	November 30, 2013</p>
<p>Authorized Contacts:</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.&nbsp; THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.&nbsp; THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES.&nbsp; THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. <br /><br />Request for Information<br />T-38A/C Forward Canopy Panel Redesign with Through-The-Canopy Ejection Capability,&nbsp; PN 2-13201-49, NSN 1560-00-886-1399<br /><br />This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI).&nbsp; This not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.<br /><br />1. Purpose:&nbsp;The purpose of this RFI is to gather comments and identify potential sources, materials, timeframe, and approximate costs to redesign, test, and produce 550 ea. T-38 forward canopy transparencies to increase bird strike capability while maintaining the existing Through-The-Canopy (TTC) ejection capability.<br /><br />2. Background: The T-38 System Program Office (SPO) requires an industry response regarding innovative or diverse technology that meet, what can only be described as, &lsquo;conflicting' canopy performance needs i.e. maintain TTC capability and increase bird impact resistant capabilities. The current 0.23 inch thick stretched acrylic transparency can resist a 4-pound bird impact at 165 knots which does not offer a capability to resist significant bird impacts, and has resulted in the loss of six (6) aircraft and two pilot fatalities. Numerous attempts since 1970 were made to evaluate existing materials and redesign a transparency that could withstand a bird impact of 4 pounds at 400 knots. However, the increased transparency thickness proposal to increase bird strike survivability would have required modification of canopy operating mechanisms and addition of a transparency fracturing system, which significantly increased the cost of the modification. Although it would increase the level of bird impact protection, the proposal was cancelled due to the high cost of the modification.<br /><br />3. Scope of Task: <br />&bull;Develop a new state of the art technology that will optimize the transparency design to maximize bird strike resistance while maintaining a total transparency weight of less than 68 pounds. Maintaining the weight below 68 pounds will negate the need to modify canopy operating mechanisms and significantly reduce costs. The contractor's response to the RFI should include an estimate of final bird strike resistance. <br />&bull;Redesigned transparency must retain the TTC ejection capability. <br />&bull;Materials must be manufactured in accordance with aviation industry standards, design specifications, requirements, and tolerances.<br />&bull;Incorporate existing transparency to canopy frame, fuselage attachment fitting, and canopy support.<br />&bull;Redesigned transparency should be able to maintain or improve current aircraft optical requirement (Optical requirements must meet approval of qualified FCF pilot), or current industry standards. <br /><br />4. Information/Format: Potential offerors willing to become qualified source must be able to submit a Source Approval Request (SAR). Potential offerors shall provide information on relevant performance history and/or evidence of capability to satisfy this type of requirement, to include the NSN or PN (if existent). Potential offerors will demonstrate the offeror's infrastructure and integration capability to provide all aspects of this task to include but not limited to the following:<br />&bull;Manufacturing aircraft components, specifically canopy panels<br />&bull;Previous Government projects/qualification/approval/contract by similarity<br />&bull;Other pertinent data concerning your qualification to manufacture the required item.<br /><br />Please submit electronically your response in an executive summary format not to exceed 5 pages. If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information. <br /><br />Final vendor RFI responses are due by close of business 27 November 2013.<br /><br />The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.<br /><br />For questions, comments or RFI response, please contact:<br /><br />Attn: Kimberlene Butler <br />Contracting Officer<br />DSN 775-3801 <br />6072 Fir Ave, Bldg 1233<br />HAFB UT 84056-5820<br /><a href="mailto:Kimberlene.Butler@hill.af.mil">Kimberlene.Butler@hill.af.mil</a>

<DESC>Solicitation Number:   W15P7T-13-D-GTAC-S039 <br>  <br> Notice Type: Request for Information/Sources Sought Announcement for Retrofit of the AN/TPQ-53 Initial Production Radar Systems  <br>  <br> 1.  Synopsis.  <br>  <br> This Request for Information/Sources Sought Announcement (RFI/SSA) is being issued to accomplish market research for the retrofit of up to 32 AN/TPQ-53 Initial Production (IP) Radar Systems, program management support, and the production acceptance testing (PAT) of each retrofitted system. <br>  <br> This RFI/SSA is being issued to obtain information from interested sources regarding their ability to satisfy the requirements of the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar System Retrofit Modification dated 17 October 2013, which is provided as an attachment to this announcement.  <br>  <br> The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI/SSA, or to otherwise pay for the information requested. This RFI/SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal. It shall not be used as the basis for a proposal.  <br>  <br> 2. Program Overview.  <br>  <br> The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Radar Systems. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System shall satisfy known, current, and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System is a highly mobile radar that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM). It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions. The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth. It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.    <br>  <br> Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection. Current indirect fire detection systems lack the mobility and agility to meet the requirements of the supported force and are too large and slow to support units in all types of military operations. Brigade combat teams and Fires Brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counterfire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations.  <br>  <br> 3.  Procurement History.  <br>  <br> In 2006, the Government awarded a development contract (W15P7T-06-C-T004) to Lockheed Martin following full and open competition.  This contract provided for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System and the purchase of four radars.  Twelve additional radars were purchased under the same contract in response to a directed procurement in July 2008.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the acquisition of up to 20 radars.  Seventeen of the 20 systems were purchased via letter contract in April 2010.  Three additional assets were procured in August 2011.  On 29 February 2012, the Government competitively awarded a FFP contract (W15P7T-12-C-C015) for procurement of up to 54 low rate initial production (LRIP) systems.  The following table provides contract information relevant to these procurement actions. <br>  <br> Contract Number <br> Award Date	Contractor	Extent Competed/Authority <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	26 Sep 06	Lockheed Martin	Competed <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	25 Jul 08	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	12 Apr 10	Lockheed Martin	Letter Contract; award of 17 systems as part of an undefinitized contract action (UCA)  (FAR 16.302-1) <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	11 Aug 11	Lockheed Martin	UCA Definitization; award of 3 systems (FAR 16.302-1) <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Competed <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	26 Jun 13	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br>  <br> 4. Description of Contract Action.  <br>  <br> The Government anticipates retrofit will be accomplished under a firm fixed price (FFP) delivery order (DO) issued under the Global Tactical Advanced Communications System (GTACS) contract W15P7T-11-R-C001. A draft PWS is attached to this announcement.  The AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901) is available upon request.  This effort will require the retrofit of up to 32 AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar Systems, program management support, and PAT of each retrofitted system. The retrofitted systems must be identical to the AN/TPQ-53 LRIP configuration and meet all requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System Performance Specification (77A582901).  The period of performance is up to 36 months, comprised of 3 ordering periods. <br>  <br> The first IP system to be retrofitted will be made available to the contractor within 30 days of contract award.  The Government will provide the remaining AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar Systems as Government furnished equipment (GFE) to the contractor, at a rate specified by the contractor, to accomplish retrofit actions necessary to fulfill the terms of the DO.  Systems will be furnished to the contractor without ancillary equipment, Components of End Item (COEI), Basic Issue Items (BII), or 60 kilowatt (kw) prime power generators. The contractor is not responsible for the re-integration of ancillary equipment, COEI, BII, or generators prior to acceptance testing and delivery. <br>  <br> The IP system will be prepared by the Government at a Government facility for turn-over to the contractor for retrofit.  Prime movers of IP systems provided for retrofit will be inspected, maintained, and repaired prior to delivery to the contractor to ensure prime mover mechanical or electrical issues do not impact contractor production activities. Prime power generators will be separated from the IP system during this process. <br>  <br> The following items will be provided as Government furnished information (GFI).  On completion of acceptance testing of the retrofitted system, the contractor shall deliver the completed AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems with the following overpacked in each delivered VPC-95 Communications Subsystem Shelter: <br>  <br> a.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request. This Request For Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and/or materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION:  The United States Army, Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)  Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) is planning to design, develop, integrate, and demonstrate a Multi-Function Imager for Rotary Wing (MFI4RW) applications, distributed aperture system (DAS), with spherical coverage provided by a synergistic imager/imaging system in the degraded visual environment (DVE) pilotage, and threat warning to support Army Aviation Aircraft.  The MFI4RW must be interoperable with state of the art army aviation display technology, helmet mounted display (HMD) and/or multi-function display (MFD).  The MFI4RW will strive for the best possible balance between performance and SWaP-C.  <br>  <br> The MFI4RW effort will follow the procedure described in the paragraph below.  Design trade studies, field of regard sensor coverage simulations, selecting the design(s)/concept(s) that will or have potential to meet performance, and SWaP-C goals.  Develop, design, and build prototype subassemblies and continue evolutionary development while integrating onto a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Army Aircraft.  The MFI4RW integrated onto a GFE Army Aircraft will also be integrated with a Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) display.  The integrated MFI4RW with CFE display(s) will be submitted for flight qualification and performance testing.  Following successful qualification and testing, aircraft integration will start.  Additional testing may include ground testing/simulation, flight testing/demonstrations.  After successful flight testing a performance specification will be developed and transitioned to the Army Aviation Acquisition Community.  Projected timeline for the program is FY14-19.   <br>  <br> REQUIREMENTS:  NVESD is looking for a MFI4RW system that can meet the needs of the Army Aviation community.  The system will be an open architecture system enabling compatibility with Future Airborne Capability Environment consortium products intended ultimately for the Joint Multi Role, Future Vertical Lift aircraft of 2030.   The system must demonstrate the following minimum capability metrics: <br>  <br> Pilotage Capability:  Pilotage is defined as the process of flying the aircraft from point A to point B, heads up eyes out and visually coupled, and can encompass all phases of flight (enroute, initial approach, hover, landing, takeoff) in all flight conditions including the Degraded Visual Environment (rain, snow, fog, dust, smog/haze, zero illumination night).  Specifications - Field of Regard: 180o Az, 90o El (front); Visual acuity:  greater than  20/55; IR Resolution:  greater than 0.4cyc/mrad @ 0.1o C; Image Intensification Resolution:   greater than 0.2 cyc/mrad @ 3x10-6 fL and  greater than 0.6 cyc/mrad @ 3x10-3 fL; Frame Rate:  greater than 60Hz. <br>  <br> Situational Awareness (SA) Capability:  Rear Hemispherical; Visual acuity:   greater than 20/80; Dwell Time:   less than 8msec. <br>  <br> Threat Warning Capability:  Field of Regard: Spherical; Pd: All threats to Army Aviation @max range.  <br>  <br> Display Field of View:  Minimum:  30o El by 50o horizontal; Display Format:   Digital HD 1920X1080p. <br>  <br> System Latency:   less than 50msec. <br>  <br> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  NVESD welcomes white papers recommending systems that will satisfy the minimum capability metrics in the specified time frame (FY14-19). Vendor teaming is encouraged if applicable.   <br>  <br> For existing systems, vendors are asked to supply the following information: <br>  <br> A self assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the current system. <br>  <br> System specification and a self assessment (measured performance) of discrete capabilities (e.g., Pilotage, DVE, Threat Warning, etc...). <br>  <br> Any flight testing results if available for distribution, of particular interest is any user feedback of the system. <br>  <br> Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) data <br>  <br> Aircraft integration information (e.g., what type aircraft, integrated with avionics or stand alone), mounting locations for each sensor. <br>  <br> Describe man-machine interface as much as possible <br>  <br> For developmental systems (this includes systems with some existing equipment, but plan to augment with some novel technology), vendors are asked to supply the following information: <br>  <br> Salient features of the proposed system and how they address the SWaP-C optimization concern <br>  <br> Current/proposed schedule <br>  <br> Current TRL and projected TRL at planned completion <br>  <br> Any available performance data <br>  <br> White papers should also address: <br>  <br> Describe each module (e.g., single aperture or multiple apertures) and the interdependencies on the other modules within the system.   It is anticipated that a system would be modular in nature and modules may be combined to provide the system level performance.   <br>  <br> How specific modules address each critical capability of the MFI4RW (e.g., Pilotage, SA, DVE, and Threat Warning) individually and as an ensemble/system.  Also highlight any SWaP-C benefits achieved through this architecture if they exist.  <br>  <br> Describe how the mass amounts of data from multiple high resolution, high frame rate senor modules and/or subsystems will be accessed to provide a system level capability.  Describe the state of this development work. <br>  <br> Describe how this multi-function capability will be integrated (notionally) into an aircrafts avionics and how the man-machine interface with aircrew will be impacted or enhanced.  This must include the approach to display the data (imagery, and information) to the aircrew (e.g., display requirements must be addressed).  <br>  <br> Technology Roadmap detailing path to achieve this document's requirements <br>  <br> Specifications and performance metrics of relevant systems <br>  <br> Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for development cost, if applicable, and unit cost for potential future Government procurements.  <br>  <br> The white paper should also address any other features of your system that may enhance overall  aircraft capabilities (current and proposed new technologies). White papers should not exceed 40 pages in length.  The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements or commit the Government or vendor to any action.  It is desirable that data be received with government purpose rights.  However, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.   Clearly mark all proprietary information.  All responses to this market research shall be submitted no later than 4:00 PM EST (local time at Fort Belvoir, VA) on 16 December 2013.  <br>  <br> All questions and white papers must be submitted via e-mail to Maurice G.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Honolulu District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) on the Command and Control Facility (C2F) Ph 2 for the following large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the State of Hawaii:
<p>FY14 MCA PN70668 USARPAC Command and Control Facility (C2F) Phase 2, Fort Shafter, Oahu, Hawaii</p>
<p>Project Description: Construct a Command and Control Facility (C2F) Complex. This project is Phase 2 of a 6-phase project. This phase includes construction of administrative and special use spaces divided into specified security zones. Facility construction includes redundant mechanical and electrical systems with backup power for designated areas, information systems, fire protection and alarm systems, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) installation, and Energy Monitoring connection. Sustainable Design and Development and Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05) features will be provided. Supporting facilities include site development, utility tunnel, utilities and connections, lighting, paving, walks, curbs and gutters, storm drainage, information systems, landscaping and signage. Air conditioning will be provided by connection to the complex central utility plant. Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided. The estimated performance period is 24 months. Magnitude is $25M - $100M.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br />b. The complexity of the project. <br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area. <br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs for this requirement. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) What trades are expected to be employed on this project? Are you likely to need some union skilled trades for at least part of this project?<br />(2) What market share does union labor have in the State of Hawaii?<br />(3) Does the local market currently contain the sufficient number of available skilled workers for this project? Are there any specific events or other factors which may limit the pool of skill labor available for this project? <br />(4) Are there any specific skilled labor disciplines that would require an apprenticeship program to expand the pool of qualified workers needed for this project? If so, identify the skill labor disciplines and describe the apprenticeship program.<br />(5) Have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by the public or private sector in the State of Hawaii? If so, identify the projects.<br />(6) Are there any Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA) likely to expire during the course of this project under consideration that might cause delays? If so, identify the CBAs and describe the types of delays.<br />(7) How do union wage rates in the local market compare to Davis Bacon rates?<br />(8) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings on the project? If so, identify and discuss how a PLA could contribute to cost savings.<br />(9) Could a PLA minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency on the project? If so, identify and discuss how a PLA could minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency.<br />(10) Are there ways in which a PLA might increase costs on this particular project? If so, identify and discuss how a PLA might increase costs on this project.</p>
<p>Please provide your project specific comments via e-mail to Tristin Matsuki, Contract Specialist, at tristin.n.matsuki@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on December 2, 2013.</p>

The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b.	The complexity of the project.  <br> c.	Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d.	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e.	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area. <br> f.	The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.  <br> g.	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h.	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> a.	Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> b.	An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> 1.	Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>  <br> 2.	Be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:   <br>  <br> a.	Should a PLA be executed on the above described Beachfill, Great Egg Harbor Inlet to Townsends Inlet, Cape May County, NJ?  What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Beachfill project? <br>  <br> b.	Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency?  If so, how?  What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA?  Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c.	Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project?  Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? <br>  <br> d.	Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project?  Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e.	This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.  Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f.	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?  Are there large scale construction projects in the area which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project?  What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? <br>  <br> g.	How will a PLA impact the completion time?  Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h.	Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i.	Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small business utilization goals? <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey. <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via email to Emily Giardino, Contract Specialist, at Emily.M.Giardino@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 P.M.

Submitted information should be in response to the specific requirements listed below:

Hoteling Requirements:  
 
The Contractor shall provide a turnkey or office services solution consisting of Class A office space.  The turnkey per seat or per person office services solution shall include all equipment, furnishings, and administrative and normal support functions (receptionist, mail delivery, etc.) necessary for a normal professional office environment on a per seat basis.

The Contractor shall provide all standard maintenance and infrastructure support services to include janitorial, housekeeping, snow removal, and maintenance/repair of Contractor provided office machines.

Contractor response times to service requests shall be no more than one hour for requests made to personnel on site for normal professional support (e.g. mail delivery, telecommunication issues, office machine malfunctions, etc.).

The contractor support staff which provide the 'face to the customer' for the general public or other off site VA and other government staff shall comport themselves in a professional, helpful, and courteous manner.

The contractor is responsible for conducting business between the hours of 8:30 AM and 5:00 Monday through Friday except on Federal holidays and/or when the facility is closed due to local or national emergencies, administrative closings, or similar Government directed facility closings.  The Contractor must at all times maintain an adequate workforce when the facility is not closed for the above reasons.  The Government shall have access to the space at all times, including the use of electrical services, toilets, lights, elevators, and Government office machines without additional payment.

The Contractor shall develop procedures covering key control that shall be included in the Quality Control Plan.  Such procedures shall include turn-in of any issued keys by personnel who no longer require access to locked areas.  The Contractor shall immediately report any occurrences of lost or duplicate to the Contracting Officer. 

In the event that keys, other than master keys, are lost or duplicated, the Contractor shall, upon direction of the Contracting Officer, re-key or replace the affected lock or locks; however, the Government, at its discretion, may replace the affected lock or locks or perform re-keying.

<DESC>1.  Synopsis.    <br>  <br>      <br>  <br> This Request for Information/Sources Sought Announcement (RFI/SSA) is being issued to accomplish market research for the retrofit of up to 32 AN/TPQ-53 Initial Production (IP) Radar Systems, program management support, and the production acceptance testing (PAT) of each retrofitted system.   <br>  <br> This RFI/SSA is being issued to obtain information from interested sources regarding their ability to satisfy the requirements of the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar System Retrofit Modification dated 17 October 2013, which is provided as an attachment to this announcement.        <br>  <br> The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI/SSA, or to otherwise pay for the information requested. This RFI/SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal. It shall not be used as the basis for a proposal.   <br>  <br> 2. Program Overview.    <br>  <br> The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Radar Systems. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System shall satisfy known, current, and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System is a highly mobile radar that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM). It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions. The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth. It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.      <br>  <br> Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection. Current indirect fire detection systems lack the mobility and agility to meet the requirements of the supported force and are too large and slow to support units in all types of military operations. Brigade combat teams and Fires Brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counterfire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations.    <br>  <br> 3.  Procurement History.    <br>  <br> In 2006, the Government awarded a development contract (W15P7T-06-C-T004) to Lockheed Martin following full and open competition.  This contract provided for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System and the purchase of four radars.  Twelve additional radars were purchased under the same contract in response to a directed procurement in July 2008.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the acquisition of up to 20 radars.

Description of Contract Action.    <br>  <br> The Government anticipates retrofit will be accomplished under a firm fixed price (FFP) delivery order (DO) issued under the Global Tactical Advanced Communications System (GTACS) contract W15P7T-11-R-C001. A draft PWS is available upon request.  The AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901) is available upon request.  This effort will require the retrofit of up to 32 AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar Systems, program management support, and PAT of each retrofitted system. The retrofitted systems must be identical to the AN/TPQ-53 LRIP configuration and meet all requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System Performance Specification (77A582901).  The period of performance is up to 36 months, comprised of 3 ordering periods.    <br>  <br> The first IP system to be retrofitted will be made available to the contractor within 30 days of contract award.  The Government will provide the remaining AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar Systems as Government furnished equipment (GFE) to the contractor, at a rate specified by the contractor, to accomplish retrofit actions necessary to fulfill the terms of the DO.  Systems will be furnished to the contractor without ancillary equipment, Components of End Item (COEI), Basic Issue Items (BII), or 60 kilowatt (kw) prime power generators. The contractor is not responsible for the re-integration of ancillary equipment, COEI, BII, or generators prior to acceptance testing and delivery.   <br>  <br> The IP system will be prepared by the Government at a Government facility for turn-over to the contractor for retrofit.  Prime movers of IP systems provided for retrofit will be inspected, maintained, and repaired prior to delivery to the contractor to ensure prime mover mechanical or electrical issues do not impact contractor production activities. Prime power generators will be separated from the IP system during this process.  <br>      <br> The following items will be provided as Government furnished information (GFI).  On completion of acceptance testing of the retrofitted system, the contractor shall deliver the completed AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems with the following overpacked in each delivered VPC-95 Communications Subsystem Shelter:   <br>  <br>   a.  Two hard copies of Technical Manual (TM) 11-5840-390-10, Operator's Manual for Counter fire Target Acquisition Radar, AN/TPQ-53, Part Number (P/N) 77A580320G2, National Stock Number (NSN):  5840-01-601-7155.      <br>  <br>   b.  Two hard copies of  TM 11-5840-390-23&P, Field Maintenance Manual Including Repair Parts And Special Tools List For Counter Fire Target Acquisition Radar, AN/TPQ-53, P/N 77A580320G2, NSN:  5840-01-601-7155.   <br>  <br>   c.  Two Interactive Electronic Technical Publications (IETP) on Compact Disc (CD), (one for each system RCDU).  <br>      <br>   d.  Two hard copies of all commercial off the shelf (COTS) manuals required for operation and maintenance support for the commercial components within the end item.   <br>  <br>   e.  The Interactive Computer Based Training (ICBT) digital video disk (DVD).   <br>  <br>   f.  On board spares in standard packing materials or transit cases.   <br>  <br>   g.  Current software version, as directed by the Government loaded on the two Remote Controlled Display Unit (RCDU) Miltope computers provided with the system.      <br>  <br>   h.  All system specific GFE furnished with the IP system for retrofit in accordance with the attached PWS (see Appendix D, Government Furnished Equipment).   <br>  <br>  <br> 5. Request for Information.    <br>     <br> All responses to this RFI/SSA should include the following information:      <br>  <br>        a. State whether your firm is interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor on the AN/TPQ-53 radar contract. Companies that intend to be a prime contractor should clearly demonstrate that they possess the technology, design and production capabilities to meet the specified requirements. Any small business interested in participating as the prime contractor should clearly articulate their plan to satisfy the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.    <br>  <br>       b. Summarize relevant experience with radar technologies. Identify any systems in development, systems planned for development, or fielded systems that may be used or leveraged to satisfy the requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901).     <br>  <br>       c. Assess the risk associated with meeting the requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901).  Specifically, lay out the impact to cost, schedule and performance given the Government does not have build-to-print production level drawing to provide.     <br>  <br>       d. Describe production and manufacturing capacity. Identify the length of time after contract award that production representative IP retrofit systems will be available for acceptance testing. Identify the minimum, maximum and optimal monthly production rate for the proposed system. Identify the lead time required to achieve each of these production rates.   <br>  <br>       e. Identify major cost drivers for this action.    <br>  <br>       f. Provide a milestone schedule for accomplishing the system retrofits.    <br>  <br>       g. Identify potential partner/teaming arrangements or joint ventures that may be pursued to meet AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar retrofit requirements.    <br>  <br>       h. Clearly identify assumptions on which your response is predicated. As a minimum, identify any required GFE/GFI on which the approach is predicated, and all required Government support anticipated.   <br>      <br>       i.

<SUBJECT>--Intent to award sole source PO: Gas for use in NPS-owned boats,Stehekin, WA.
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:Sarah_Welch@nps.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure unleaded gasoline for use in NPS-owned boats operating on Lake Chelan, Washington, for the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, on a sole source basis from Guest Services Inc. under authority of FAR Parts 6.302-1, 12, and 13. A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is included below.
Stehekin is a remote community located within Lake Chelan National Recreation Area at the north end of Lake Chelan, approximately 50 miles from Chelan, Washington. The Stehekin valley is isolated; the roads do not connect with any highway system. The NPS owns boats used to transport personnel and materials between the towns of Stehekin and Chelan, WA, as well as occasionally performing medical evacuations of park visitors.  NPS does not own or operate a marina, but permits a concession operation to provide fuel to the visiting public at Stehekin; the current concessionaire is Guest Services, Inc.
NPS will establish an indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity purchase order for an estimated quantity of gasoline to be purchased at current market prices. The value of this procurement is estimated to be between $10,000 and $20,000 for fuel purchased between 10/1/13 and 9/30/14. 
This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals, or quotations. No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted. No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals, or quotations received in response to this notice; however any firm that believes they have capabilities to provide this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer at sarah_welch@nps.gov. All comments received before 9:30 am PT November 6, 2013, will be considered.  A determination by the government regarding whether to compete this procurement will be based on responses to this notice and is solely at the discretion of the government.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost): Purchase of boat fuel at Stehekin, WA, for use in NPS patrol (law enforcement) and maintenance vessels.  Orders will be placed by boat operators, who will fuel vessels as necessary following the vendors established fueling procedures.  The vendor will send a monthly consolidated invoice itemizing all individual orders.  Prices will be based on current market costs; the Government will be charged the same or lower prices as those charged to the general public.  Typical annual costs for boat fuel are less than $15,000.  Price in FY13 was generally $5.06 per gallon.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below): _x_ Only one responsible source. ___ Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. ___ Other   Explain:  Stehekin, WA, is located at the head of Lake Chelan, 55 miles from the town of Chelan, WA, within Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. The only access is by public passenger-only ferry, barge, private vessel, or float plane from Chelan.  There are few private enterprises at Stehekin, and only one marina, which is a concession operation run by Guest Services Inc. (GSI) DBA North Cascades Lodge at Stehekin.  This marina is the sole source for boat fuel in the upper lake.  NOTE: NPS maintains fuel facilities for ground-based vehicles ~1.5 miles by road from the marina, but the location of these tanks and the potential spill hazards associated with carrying fuel to boats make it an unacceptable source.  Other marinas are available in and near Chelan, 55 miles from Stehekin; too far to be practical fueling sources.
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest: None performed since we know there is only one source.
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies: a. Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b. The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent: Assignment of Exclusive License to Develop and Commercialize the Unified Incident Command Decision Support (UICDS) Software System
<SOLNBR>DHS-UICDS-14-01
<RESPDATE>111513
<CONTACT>Mitchell D. Winans, Phone 2022546365, Email mitchell.winans@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>Assignment of Exclusive License to Develop and Commercialize the Unified Incident Command Decision Support (UICDS) Software System
<p>AGENCY: Science and Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security</p>
<p>ACTION: Notice of Intent</p>
<p>SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS-S&amp;T), located in Washington DC, intends to issue an exclusive royalty-free, sub-licensable worldwide license for the continued design, development, distribution, support and commercialization of the Unified Incident Command Decision Support software system (UICDS) to the National Institute for Hometown Security (NIHS) for an initial period of five years with provision for an extension.</p>
<p>UICDS is a national "middleware foundation" designed to support information sharing for the National Response Framework and the National Incident Management System, including the Incident Command System. UICDS middleware is transparent to system operators during operations. It requires no special training. It is built around data standards and the National Information Exchange Model. UICDS enables information sharing across domains, roles, hazards, echelons and applications. Users of UICDS are emergency managers and incident commanders in different departments and agencies in federal, state, local, and tribal organizations as well as critical infrastructure owners/operators. Data ownership is retained and controlled by those who developed, processed, and stored it. Information cannot be pulled without permission. The user explicitly agrees to what fraction of their data can be shared through the UICDS software. Agreements among organizations establish information sharing policies for the flow of data in day-to-day situations and during an incident. UICDS supports the escalation of resource requests as personnel and resources are committed and deployed from small-scale mutual aid incidents to large-scale disasters. Organizations are represented and interconnected within a peer-to-peer network of UICDS software "cores," thus enabling multi-jurisdictional information sharing to adhere to policy agreements. UICDS software is available at no cost to emergency response providers. To date, over 250 companies, universities, and technology providers are actively engaged in UICDS development and deployment.</p>
<p>The United States Government designed and contracted for the development of the UICDS software over several years and at a cost in excess of $12 million in order to provide United States Federal agencies and state, local, federally-recognized tribal, and territorial governments and other governmental first responder entities with the ability to share information across multiple electronic communications platforms in the planning for, responding to, and recovering from a natural or man-made disaster. The design of the UICDS software allows for possible commercial uses. The UICDS software package consists of computer software programs and related documentation reported as GSC-15756-1, and identified as "Unified Incident Command and Decision Support Software" and "Unified Incident Command and Decision Support Development Kit," developed under NASA Contract NNG08CA07C. The UICDS software comprises the Source Code, executable code (machine-readable code) and other documentation. The UICDS software is subject to United States Copyright law. The United States Government owns the copyright in the UICDS software, by assignment from SAIC, dated May 5, 2010, and has the right to grant the license to NIHS and its Affiliates.</p>
<p>UICDS will transition from a fully government supported research &amp; development and pilot demonstration program, to a market-based commodity program under the licensing agreement with NIHS. One stipulation of this agreement is the UICDS software (current and any future versions) must be made available without cost to the first responder community of federal, state, local and tribal governments. The objectives of this transition are to: (1) Commercialize the UICDS middleware software product through an operations and business model that ultimately sustains UICDS independently of direct government financial support and drives the deployment of the product nationally; and, <br />(2) Forge an open source software environment that encourages the adoption of the product and its ongoing development. No additional DHS-S&amp;T funding will be provided to support this endeavor.</p>
<p>To accomplish this transition, NIHS will establish "The UICDS Enterprise." The components of the UICDS Enterprise should include: (1) NIHS; (2) a UICDS Consortium consisting of university researchers, end-users (including First Responder representation), applications developers and software vendors; and, (3) subcontractors that provide support services to fulfill The UICDS Enterprise mission. The components will operate in a coordinated manner to distribute the UICDS software to first responder agencies and achieve the additional objective to develop the software as a commercial product and services.</p>
<p>Tasks required to accomplish this goal include:<br />1. Develop and maintain a UICDS Enterprise Business Plan<br />2. Establish and Maintain a Consortium of UICDS Researchers, Developers, End-Users and Vendors<br />3. Establish and Maintain an Open Source Environment that Supports Continued Development of the UICDS Core<br />4. Engage in User-Community Outreach activities and Technical Support Necessary to Implement the UICDS Enterprise Operations Plan developed as part of the UICDS R&amp;D task. Outreach activities include:<br />a. Operate the UICDS web site at www.uicds.us <br />b. Conduct a bi-weekly conference call/webinar type video call with vendors, UICDS users, and supporting researchers in universities and federal laboratories. Typically, 80 to 100 people participate in this conference call.<br />c. Publish a bi-weekly UICDS newsletter covering development activities, operational pilots and other matters of interest to the UICDS community.<br />d. Participate in annual national conferences of organizations such as NEMA and IAEM by providing a display booth to demonstrate UICDS. For planning purposes, plan on six conferences of four days duration.</p>
<p>DHS intends to grant to NIHS the right to sublicense the UICDS software for commercial purposes under the following conditions: No less than 50% of net profits from commercial licensing and the provision of associated support or services of the UICDS software, shall be used by NIHS to further the UICDS software maintenance, development and distribution, including but not limited to activities related to making the UICDS software accessible to First Responders, program management, research and development, commercialization and intellectual property protection. NIHS may apply for registration of any trademark or service mark or assert any common law rights in marks associated with any version of the UICDS software that it licenses commercially or to others, who are not First Responders.</p>
<p>"First Responders" is defined to mean those Federal, State and local governmental agencies and entities and Federally-recognized tribal governments and entities that in the early stages of an emergency incident are responsible for the protection and preservation of life, property, evidence, and the environment, including: emergency public safety, fire, law enforcement, emergency response and emergency medical (including hospital emergency facilities) agencies.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office intends to negotiate and issue a commercial services contract to MSS International, 9159 Fox Fire Way, Highlands Ranch, CO 80129 for FY14 Data Synchronizer services. <br /><br />The objectives of the FY 14 Data Synchronizer is the acquisition, installation, and configuration of data synchronization software, as well as the maintenance and training related to data synchronization activities. Specifically, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires a complete, turn-key, integrated data synchronization solution to maintain bi-directional synchronization between the legacy Trademark Reporting and Application Monitoring System (TRAM) database, implemented using the Unisys DMS II non relational database management system operating on the Unisys mainframe, and the Trademark Next Generation (TM NG) database, implemented using the Oracle relational database management system operating under Linux. <br /><br />Implementing this objective requires:<br /><br />&bull; The acquisition of data synchronization proprietary software source-code licenses between Unisys DMS II and Oracle databases that can meet the integration requirements of this SOW. <br />&bull; The acquisition of Unisys mainframe COBOL code coverage proprietary software licenses.<br />&bull; The acquisition of Unisys mainframe COBOL pre-compiler proprietary software licenses.<br />&bull; Customization, configuration, and integration of the licensed software into a solution meeting the requirements of the Data Synchronization Detailed Design Requirements document <br />&bull; Modifications to USPTO COBOL and ALGOL program sources as required to meet the integration requirements of this SOW.<br />&bull; Support services including installation, maintenance and training as required to meet the requirements of this SOW.</p>
<p>The contract will contain a base year and up to four (4) option years. Period of performance for the base year is approximately 12/1/2013 to 9/30/2014. Market research indicates that MSS International is the only known source for providing the data synchronizer services needed by OCIO. When USPTO originally became a user of Unisys mainframes, there were thousands of Unisys systems installed and dozens of companies providing third party software and services to the market. However, USPTO's market research has revealed that it is estimated that less than 400 Unisys A-Series mainframe sites are still active and half of those are outside of the United States. The market is now too small to support multiple companies that provide software products specifically for the Unisys mainframe market. The only company other than Unisys that is still active in the Unisys A-Series market is MSS International. and only MSS International has the two required component products accompanying the synchronizer, mainframe based pre-compiler, and mainframe based code coverage analyzer.<br /><br />As a result of USPTO's exemption from the Competition in Contracting Act, the subject requirement is being procured using the Alternative Competition Method in accordance with the Patent and Trademark Office Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) and the Patent and Trademark Office Efficiency Act, 35 U.S.C. 2(b)(4)(A). The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services), proposed Federal Supply Code (FSC) is D307 (Automated Information System Design and Integration Services, and Small Business Size Standard is $25.5 million. This notice is neither a Request for Proposals nor a solicitation of offers.</p>

<DESC>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Division Middle East District, Contracting Office intends to extend routine, traditional operations and maintenance (O&M) services for Afghan National Security Forces' (ANSF) facilities located in the provinces and districts throughout Northern Afghanistan under contract W912ER-10-D-0002 awarded to ITT Systems Corporation (now Exelis Systems Corporation), 665 Space Center Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80915-3604.  A modification to the existing contract is intended in order to avoid disruption of O&M services as well as unacceptable delays and significant cost to the Government; an award to other than Exelis would result in irretrievable costs and other valuable resources through competition and risk the degradation of the structural integrity and overall facility operating systems (power, water and sewer) of the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) facilities.  In addition, a delay would impede ANSF's capability to meet their objective to take full responsibility of facility operations and sustainment as the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) prepares the ANA and ANP to provide competent and capable leadership for an effective defense force in Afghanistan. <br>  <br> Awarded in 2010, contract W912ER-10-D-0002 provides labor, services, supplies, oversight support, materials, tools, equipment, spare parts, warehousing, inventory control, security, transportation and other items necessary to perform O&M services for infrastructure and systems at ANA and ANP facilities such as ANA brigade camps, ANSF medical facilities and ANP police stations.  Routine, traditional O&M support consists of the following services:  operation, maintenance, repair and minor construction of real property facilities; ancillary engineering design services in support of the operation, maintenance, repair and minor construction of real property facilities; standard utility locater services; scheduled and unscheduled maintenance; minor pest control; equipment inventories, condition assessments; emergency services such as restoration of power, water and sanitation; preventative maintenance; O&M manuals; property accounting and control of real property; and environmental services.  The contractor is responsible for all planning, programming, administration, management, supervision and execution necessary to provide the O&M services. <br>  <br> The performance period for this extension of O&M services will be no longer than six months beginning on or about 01 April 2014 to on or about 30 September 2014.  The value of this extension is estimated not to exceed $48 million. <br>  <br> All services under this contract will continue to be performed in Afghanistan. <br>  <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, in accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16), the Government will consider information received by interested sources by 4PM 15 November 2013.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>  <br> All interested firms must respond by 4PM 15 November 2013, Eastern Standard Time (EST), by e-mail to Dee Warchola at the following e-mail address:  deetra.c.warchola@usace.army.mil.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The e-mail subject line shall state:  W912ER-10-D-0002, Notice of Intent to Sole Source. <br> The following information shall be included in the response:  (1) Statement of Capability; (2) proof of SAM registration and (3) documentation that shows firm's ability to provide the required services in Afghanistan under all laws, edicts, and regulations in effect for that country as of the date of your response.  This documentation shall include (a) proof of registration in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS); (b) proof of firm's physical address, telephone number and contact information for its office in Afghanistan; and (c) proof of Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA) License. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Middle East District, will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the information requested in this Notice of Intent to Sole Source. <br>  <br>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF NEED (Statement of Work) FOR SUPPLY OR SERVICE<br />Transfer of Fuel From NOAA Ship McArthur II<br />Transfer of Fuel From NOAA Ship Ka'imimoana</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE:</p>
<p>NOAA's Marine Operations Center - Pacific (MOC-P) would like to transfer marine diesel from inactive National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) ships McArthur II and Ka'imimoana to operating NOAA public ships. The McArthur II has 88,000 gallons and the Ka'imimoana has 68,000 gallons of transferable fuel remaining. Fuel from the McArthur II will be removed first. The ships providing and receiving the fuel shall be moored at the NOAA's Marine Operations Center - Pacific (MOC-P) facility in Newport, Oregon.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>TASK 1: TRANSFER OF FUEL:<br /><br />There is about 300 feet of distance between the source and recipient fuel hookups. The source ship has a 4" camlock fitting and can pump off at a maximum of 90 gallons/minute. The contractor must provide a truck and all the hose and connections required to receive the fuel and forward it to the receiving ship. Fuel trucks and equipment can be staged on the pier supporting the ships though necessary precautions must be taken to ensure fuel is not spilled into the adjacent marine environment. Multiple transfers shall be required, each involving an estimated 12,000-50,000 gallons, occurring through the remainder of Fiscal Year 14 (ending Sept. 30, 2014). The total number of gallons to be transferred is about 136,000 gallons. The contractor is to be appropriately certified by the USCG for over water transfers and provide qualified personnel for pumping fuel over marine water to and from ships for the state of Oregon.</p>
<p>TASK 2: POLISHING OF FUEL:<br /><br />The fuel is to be polished as it is transferred. Fuel polishing is the removal of water, sediment, non-combustible particulate matter and microbial contamination below levels stated in ASTM D975 (Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils) while re-suspending combustible particulate matter to maintain ASTM standards for BTU value, lubricity, and Cetane.</p>
<p>The primary difference between fuel polishing and fuel filtration is that fuel polishing acknowledges that fuel itself can degrade and cause solids. Fuel filters simply pull the solids out because they plug up filters whereas fuel polishers break down the combustible solids so that the fuel stays within the industry specifications.</p>
<p><br />DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE:</p>
<p>1) Transfer as above an estimated 50,000 gallons on or about 08-JAN-2014.<br />2) Transfer as above an estimated 40,000 gallons on or about 13-FEB-2014.<br />3) Transfer as above an estimated 34,000 gallons on or about 20-FEB-2014.<br />Transfer as above an estimated 12,000 gallons on or about 11-MAR-2014.</p>

<CONTACT>Lynette Rocke, Phone 4045628428, Fax 4045628210, Email rocke.lynette@epa.gov
<DESC>BRAND NAME OR EQUAL.<br /><br />The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.102(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; (6), for a StarTOC Automatic Multi-Method TOC Analyzer System.&nbsp;&nbsp; The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334516.&nbsp;&nbsp;The justification for this Brand Name or Equal&nbsp;procurement is as follows:<br /><br />At present the Science and Ecosystems Support Divison (SESD) Laboratory has a Shimadzu Toc-V system for TOC water analysis with a Solid Sample Module attachment for analyzing TOC in soils. This configuration has the limited capability for running either water or soil samples, but not simultaneously. Past sample requests for water and soil analysis has dictated the need for a second instrument for added capacity and backup. <br />TOC in a salt water matrix is an analysis that SESD would like to perform. At present, SESD can perform this analysis with the Shimadzu TOC Analyzer by high temperature combustion. The suppression of TOC recoveries is a concern of this technology. Studies have shown that a concentration of 0.1% salt will affect the TOC recovery, presenting a false lower reading than actual and a concentration of 3% salt can drastically affect recovery, presenting up to a 30% false low analysis. An added down side to salt water analysis and this technology (high temperature combustion) is the corrosive nature of the salt water matrix and its effect on the instrumentation. Most instruments are designed to carry the sample into the reactor vessel where it is then oxidized or combusted. Salt accumulation in the reactor is what causes the ware-and-tear and increased maintenance on the instrumentation. <br /><br />An alternative methodology for the determination of TOC in salt water is Oxidation by Ozone/Hydroxyl Radicals and UV/Heated Persulfate Simultaneously. With UV persulfate digestion alone, complete oxidation of the sample can be dramatically reduced due to the high levels of salts in the sample. Saline levels for each sample (generally around 3% for sea water) would first have to be determined. This would then call for the appropriate amount of persulfate reagent and acid to be added to each sample, assuring the complete oxidation of carbon. <br />This unique technology that combines UV persulfate digestion with ozone promoted hydroxyl radical oxidation is available in StarTOC<sup>TM</sup> Combination Ozone/Hydroxyl Radicals and UV/Heated Persulfate Dual Path Oxidation method. This technology will allow the complete oxidation of carbon in saline samples up to 26 % (26,000 ppm).<br /><br />The&nbsp; TOC Analyzer must have at a minimum:<br />&bull; 3-Stage, Dual Method: Simultaneous, Oxidation by Ozone/Hydroxyl Radicals and UV/Heated Persulfate with Dual Path NDIRs can analyze with completely separate channels and separate dual NDIRs for TIC and TC to assure no cross-contamination. Also adds to oxidation efficiency.
<p>&bull; The ability to analyze water samples with suspended solids up to 3mm without filtration</p>
<p>&bull; Perform complete oxidation of carbon in saline samples up to 26 % (26,000 ppm) 3- stage, dual with Oxidation by Ozone/Hydroxyl Radicals.</p>
<p>&bull; The ability to flush the salts by the reacted sample to drain rather accumulating in the reactor. Causes less maintenance and down time for cleaning.</p>
<p>&bull; Measurement Range: 0.100 - 50,000 (mg/L)</p>
<p>&bull; Complying with all International Standards, such as: DIN-EN 1484, DIN-ENV 12260, DIN 38409-H3, ISO 8245, Standard Method 5310B, Standard Method 5310C, Standard Method 5310D, USEPA 415, USEPA 9060, ASTM D5173, EN 13137</p>
<p>&bull; (2) NDIRs: Multi-Sample Sparge Station which allows for purgeable and volatile organics to be measured and not lost. Thus, POC/VOC can be obtained and including TOC calculation.</p>
<p>&bull; Analytes measured: Total Organic Carbon; Total Carbon; Total Inorganic Carbon; Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon; TOC-True (including purgeable Organics)</p>
<p>&bull; Detector Type (CO2): (2) NDIR (solid state; no moving parts; computer-controlled; non-reflective sample cell-impervious to corrosion and guaranteed for 5 years)</p>
<p>&bull; Auto-Calibration, Auto-Validation, Auto-Cleaning, Historical Data/Time and Date Stamped. Programmable or on demand Validation feature that automatically feeds a standard to the analyzer and compares the response to the original calibrated response and indicates a pass or fail condition.</p>
<p>&bull; Analysis Methods: All methods in single Analyzer: UV/Heated Persulfate, High Temperature Combustion, Ozone Promoted/Hydroxyl Radical, Heated Persulfate, Ultra-Pure (UV - NDIR)</p>
<p>&bull; Sample Introduction: X-Y-Z Digital Injection/Auto-Sampler with 103 sample stations</p>
<p>All of the above unique features would serve to reduce the detection limit, increase sample output, and reduce contamination sources more than similar Total Organic Carbon analyzers from other vendors, thus better meeting EPA's needs for the most cost-effective, accurate mercury analysis of samples possible, in order to support our programs.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. <br />If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. 
If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor.

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Worldwide<br /> <br />8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities.  It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Public Health and Nutrition, Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The Pharmacist is part of the Public Health subgroup.</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Pharmacist is an integral member of OFDA's TAG.  USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Registered Pharmacist, licensed to practice in the United States, to provide OFDA with technical assistance in public health program assessment and planning for grant proposals, disasters and other areas as needed.  The OFDA pharmacist will evaluate human and veterinary medical commodity requests, local health systems and pharmaceutical supply chains to assure that only quality, safe and effective essential medicines are dispensed to beneficiaries.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br />&bull;	Conduct assessments of host nation pharmaceutical manufacturing, storage and distribution network and recommend appropriate relief activities.  Facilitate and coordinate actual U.S. Government emergency technical response activities with the USAID Mission, other donor agencies, and the U.S. Embassy. <br />&bull;	Assist OFDA to coordinate, plan, implement, and evaluate emergency pharmaceutical procurement and distribution activities to ensure that efforts in assigned program areas are meeting the needs of affected populations and satisfy the goals and objectives of the response program.<br />&bull;	Exercise independent judgment and decision-making related to pharmaceutical procurement and distribution activities, as well as evaluation of commodity requests, both in the U.S. and in the field.  Ensure that pharmaceutical procurement is in accordance with Agency regulations.  <br />&bull;	Evaluate commodity requests for appropriateness of essential medicines and medical supplies for the response and that quantities are in-line with anticipated needs.  Review data to assure that all essential medicines that may be purchased meet internationally accepted standards for safety, efficacy, and quality. <br />&bull;	Liaise with partners, international organizations and host nation authorities to ensure the appropriateness of medical commodities to be delivered.  Be aware of the local capacities for production of medical commodities, the quality of locally produced medical commodities and the impact of imported medical commodities and essential medicines on the local economy.<br />&bull;	Brief host governments on internationally accepted standards for medical commodities and essential medicines such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and Good Distribution Practices (GDPs).  Evaluate existing host nation programs and systems and recommend improvements that will enhance health care for the beneficiaries.  <br />&bull;	Coordinate and monitor OFDA-funded health care activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds.  Review documentation provided by the implementing partner to confirm that appropriate essential medicines were in fact provided to the beneficiaries.  As appropriate, apply new developments in the pharmaceutical sector to OFDA programming.<br />&bull;	Identify pharmaceutical supply chain measures that could be linked to disaster response activities. Review and analyze risk reduction principles and recommend course(s) of action to OFDA-Washington staff. <br />&bull;	Assist in the development of various types of country/regional strategies for field offices, DARTs and assessment teams. Provide briefings and written reports as required.<br /> <br />&bull;	As required, lead teams to guide and coordinate the work of other technical staff in the pharmacy sector.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Parties that are unable to meet this due date for the windblast test results and thermal values will be unable to participate. This particular data modeling is the only test of its kind and is only offered to the Government for a single testing time period. It is imperative that interested parties meet this date for submission. Rational for timeframe is done in a sequence and in order to meet the Qualified Product List publish date, the Government MUST have all interested parties' data submissions in at this time. <br /><br />7 January 2014 Government provides interested parties that have participated fully to date, the results from their company's particular data modeling tests.</p>
<p>11 March 2014, CWAS proposal is DUE from Offeror<br />NLT 1630 EST Offeror's proposal should be valid for 90 calendar days. Delivery for test assets should be anticipated to be delivered FOB Destination, within 120 days after award.</p>
<p>Government will evaluate all proposals on:<br />&bull; Technical Acceptability - ensemble must pass all testing requirements of the attached P-Spec to be considered acceptable<br />&bull; Past Performance - See FAR 13.106<br />&bull; Price - the lowest, single unit price and reasonableness</p>
<p>WHEN SUBMITTING PRICING SHEET. PRICES SHOULD BE PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>1) UNIT Price - Price of all "layers" of your ensemble. Please include price breaks, up to 100 quantity units. ****Government will evaluate all proposals based on the price of one SINGLE unit.****</p>
<p>2) Price PER EACH LAYER of your model should also be provided (i.e. if you have a model that consists of more than one layer what would be the price if the Government were to buy each layer separately, etc). If you DO NOT OFFER the layers priced out separately please state that on your proposal. Price breaks offered for multiple quantities should be included if applicable, up to 100 units.</p>
<p>(a) The Government intends to award contracts to one or more contractors, depending on availability of funding, who successfully demonstrate that they passed the testing requirements of the attached Performance Specification (P-Spec) and conform to this solicitation. Offerors shall complete the attached P-Spec Compliance Worksheet supported by actual test reports, Certificates of Compliance for all Components (P-Spec para. 3.4).</p>
<p>(b) In the synopsis posted to FedBizOpps on 17 Sept 2013, interested vendors were requested to advise the Contracting Office of their intent to participate no later than 30 Sept 2013. If interested vendors were not able to advise the Contracting Office of their intent to participate by the date requested, vendors will not be excluded from participating in this solicitation as long as they meet the requirements of this solicitation by the proposal due date. This shall be a firm fixed price effort and is set aside for small business.</p>
<p>(c) The P-Spec requires that windblast testing (para 4.11.1) be completed first. Then, thermal protection testing (para. 4.10.2) should be completed using both the windblasted ensemble and a new, non-windblasted ensemble. If the interested parties want to continue to participate, all of the previously discussed testing results will be provided to the Government to complete additional data modeling at no cost. Data results from these tests, as well as photos (for the purposes of this evaluation photos are considered data) of the garments before and after windblast, should be provided at no cost to the Government by 12 Nov 2013. The Government will, at its expense, conduct Six Cylinder Thermoregulation Data Modeling which will take approximately 60 days. This test will determine if the ensemble meets the cold weather objective/threshold required in the P-Spec (para. 3.11.2). Once testing is complete, the results will be provided to the interested party. The determination to continue testing, while the Government performs the modeling, is strictly at the interested party's discretion. The Government will not reimburse the interested party for the costs of their testing. Those ensembles that successfully pass Six Cylinder Thermoregulation Data Modeling and pass all of the other material, end item, and systems level tests outlined in the P-Spec will potentially be purchased for use in Government run aircraft integration testing; if funding is available at the time of award. The Government only intends to purchase sufficient assets to perform integration testing, subject to the availability of funding.</p>
<p>(d) After testing is complete and if funding is available at the time it is anticipated that a firm fixed price contract will be awarded to one or more product "systems" which meet the technical requirements provided in the P-SPEC. If a down-selection is required due to funding limitations the pricing evaluation laid out in 1) above applies. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror(s) within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />This acquisition will be conducted as a Small Business Set-aside (FAR 19.502-2(b)) under North American Industry Classification System Code 315210. The size standard is 500. Any small businesses who partner with a large business are reminded that they are required to perform 50% of the work on the effort to be eligible for consideration (FAR clause 52.219-8). To clarify, since we are only purchasing test assets in this case, at least 50% of the test assets in this case must be manufactured by the small business partner. The anticipated solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect as of the release date of the release date of the solicitation.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AMENDMENT 5 - Updated Version of Amendment 5 Attachment Added<br />AMENDMENT 5 - Request Capability Statements:<br /></strong>Amendment 5 establishes a second cut-off date of <strong>November 25, 2013 at 2:00pm Eastern</strong>&nbsp;for vendors to provide Capability Statements with the intention of issuing&nbsp;Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).&nbsp; Capability statements should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:fullerdf@mcc.gov">fullerdf@mcc.gov</a>.&nbsp; Amendment 5 expands Section B.2 Labor Categories/Rates to include labor categories under category entitled "Other" and add additional objectives under Section C.3.7 Objectives.&nbsp; Interested vendors shall submit a Capability Statement for the additional labor categories/objectives and/or the previously published labor categories/objectives.&nbsp; Interested vendors shall also submit the previously attached Workbook TABS entitled "Rates", "Past Performance Matrix", and "Business Information".<br /><br />AMENDMENT 4 - Responses to Questions is attached.<br /><br />AMENDMENT 3<br />The BPA covers six distinct technical work areas of possible technical work in the future: <br />&bull; Threshold Program<br />&bull; Economic Analysis<br />&bull; Monitoring and Evaluation<br />&bull; Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)<br />&bull; Social and Gender<br />&bull; Finance, Investment and Trade
<p>Each of these six work areas include a range of possible technical skills that will be required on future call orders, and for some, especially M&amp;E, the range of skills listed is very wide. Given this breadth of listed technical skills described under the BPA, it is possible that many (and possibly most) vendors will not have all the requisite skills across all six work areas or within some or all of the six work areas. This reality should not discourage vendors from responding individually, nor should it be seen as a signal that small vendors need to work together with a large prime contractor to be recognized by MCC.</p>
<p>From MCC's perspective, the objective of the BPA is to generate a population of known vendors with known areas of expertise and interest. While vendors are free to work together to submit a response to the RFQ on all elements of the six work areas, that is not MCC's primary intent. Instead, MCC encourages vendors to respond individually or in small groups to demonstrate their core competencies on any or all of the six work areas and on any or all of the skills required within each work area. It is not MCC's intention to receive responses from a small number of mega-consortia that cover all areas; rather, MCC is seeking to establish relationships with a broad range of possible future partners. That relationship is expected to be flexible. Vendors that demonstrate core competency in a subset of skills within a work area or within a sub-set of work areas will have the opportunity to respond to future task orders either by building new institutional capacity in skills that were not previously listed or to work together with other vendors that have complementary skills. In other words, individual responses from small vendors that cover only a sub-set of skills or work areas will not preclude those vendors from bidding either individually or collectively on task orders that reach beyond the core competencies listed in their response to the BPA.</p>
<p>See Attached Q&amp;As.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The <strong>first cut off date</strong> for vendor submissions of Capability Statements for MCC-13-RFQ-0084 is <strong>extended</strong> for <strong>2 weeks</strong> from May 24, 2013 <strong>to June 7, 2013 at 2:00pm Eastern Daylight Time</strong>.

<p>Vendors need not be capable of performing every requirement under the BPA. Vendors may submit Capability Statements for any of the program needs stated above.</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Hydrogen</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. In support of the mission, the NWS in Boise, ID launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 4am and 4pm MST. Each balloon requires approximately 65 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the National Weather Service is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of hydrogen (between 900 and 2,500 CF), to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen on a weekly basis to the National Weather Service office located at 3833 S. Development Ave., Bldg. 3807, Boise, ID. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for this requirement is between 900 and 1000 CF per week (between 48,000 and 52,000 CF annually).</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning January 1, 2014 and ending December 31, 2014, with the option to extend up to four additional option period years.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the National Weather Service office located at 3833 S. Development Ave., Building 3807, Boise, ID 83705. The point of delivery is at the Inflation Building, which is located in the northwest corner of the parking lot area of the main NWS office building. Access to the Inflation Building requires a key, which the Driver must obtain from NWS personnel at the time of delivery. Furthermore, the NWS is located on the National Interagency Fire Center's (NIFC) campus, which is a secure federal facility. The Driver must obtain access first to the campus via NIFC security Gatehouse entrance to the campus. The Driver must have a valid Employee ID and valid Driver's License in order to obtain access to the NIFC campus.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for six-packs or other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to twelve cylinders of hydrogen at a time. It is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 900 and 2,500 CF of hydrogen, with approximately 900 CF being used per week, leaving approximately a one-week supply of hydrogen as backup stock in case of additional unplanned balloon launches, or other unforeseen circumstances. <br /><br />Transition Period: If the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact (see section 9 of this document) shall meet to arrange the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. The meeting may be in person, by phone, or by email. It is critical to operations that the transition from the incumbent to the new Contractor occurs on the same day, with pickup of cylinders by the incumbent occurring before the new delivery, due to space constraints. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts.</p>
<p>Initial and Recurring Deliveries: For the initial delivery, the Contractor shall supply 2,500 CF of hydrogen on or before the first day of the new contract, in accordance with the agreed upon schedule, to the Place of Performance. Thereafter, the Contractor shall, on the same day each week, in accordance with the agreed upon schedule, replenish the hydrogen stock up to 2,500 CF, replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pickup the empty cylinders in the same trip.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact National Weather Service personnel at this location when arriving for delivery. The Driver needs a key to the Inflation Building and obtains the key from NWS personnel at the time of delivery. The key must be returned to the NWS personnel prior the Driver leaving the premises. A loading and unloading area is available at this location such that cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by a NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of hydrogen to 2,500 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>7. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the Meteorologist in Charge (MIC) or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>8. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's hydrogen deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />f. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices shall be sent to the following address:</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number:   W15P7T-13-D-GTAC-S039  <br>    <br>  Notice Type: Request for Information/Sources Sought Announcement for Retrofit of the AN/TPQ-53 Initial Production Radar Systems   <br>    <br>  1.  Synopsis.   <br>    <br>  This Request for Information/Sources Sought Announcement (RFI/SSA) is being issued to accomplish market research for the retrofit of up to 32 AN/TPQ-53 Initial Production (IP) Radar Systems, program management support, and the production acceptance testing (PAT) of each retrofitted system.  <br>    <br>  This RFI/SSA is being issued to obtain information from interested sources regarding their ability to satisfy the requirements of the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar System Retrofit Modification dated 17 October 2013, which is provided as an attachment to this announcement.   <br>    <br>  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI/SSA, or to otherwise pay for the information requested. This RFI/SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal. It shall not be used as the basis for a proposal.   <br>    <br>  2. Program Overview.   <br>    <br>  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Radar Systems. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System shall satisfy known, current, and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System is a highly mobile radar that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM). It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions. The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth. It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.     <br>    <br>  Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection. Current indirect fire detection systems lack the mobility and agility to meet the requirements of the supported force and are too large and slow to support units in all types of military operations. Brigade combat teams and Fires Brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counterfire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations.   <br>    <br>  3.  Procurement History.   <br>    <br>  In 2006, the Government awarded a development contract (W15P7T-06-C-T004) to Lockheed Martin following full and open competition.  This contract provided for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System and the purchase of four radars.  Twelve additional radars were purchased under the same contract in response to a directed procurement in July 2008.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the acquisition of up to 20 radars.  Seventeen of the 20 systems were purchased via letter contract in April 2010.  Three additional assets were procured in August 2011.  On 29 February 2012, the Government competitively awarded a FFP contract (W15P7T-12-C-C015) for procurement of up to 54 low rate initial production (LRIP) systems.  The following table provides contract information relevant to these procurement actions.  <br>    <br>  Contract Number  <br>  Award Date	Contractor	Extent Competed/Authority  <br>  W15P7T-06-C-T004	26 Sep 06	Lockheed Martin	Competed  <br>  W15P7T-06-C-T004	25 Jul 08	Lockheed Martin	Option Award  <br>  (FAR 17.2)  <br>  W15P7T-06-C-T004	12 Apr 10	Lockheed Martin	Letter Contract; award of 17 systems as part of an undefinitized contract action (UCA)  (FAR 16.302-1)  <br>  W15P7T-06-C-T004	11 Aug 11	Lockheed Martin	UCA Definitization; award of 3 systems (FAR 16.302-1)  <br>  W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Competed  <br>  W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Option Award  <br>  (FAR 17.2)  <br>  W15P7T-12-C-C015	26 Jun 13	Lockheed Martin	Option Award  <br>  (FAR 17.2)  <br>    <br>  4. Description of Contract Action.   <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates retrofit will be accomplished under a firm fixed price (FFP) delivery order (DO) issued under the Global Tactical Advanced Communications System (GTACS) contract W15P7T-11-R-C001. A draft PWS is available upon request.  The AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901) is available upon request.  This effort will require the retrofit of up to 32 AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar Systems, program management support, and PAT of each retrofitted system. The retrofitted systems must be identical to the AN/TPQ-53 LRIP configuration and meet all requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System Performance Specification (77A582901).  The period of performance is up to 36 months, comprised of 3 ordering periods.  <br>    <br>  The first IP system to be retrofitted will be made available to the contractor within 30 days of contract award.  The Government will provide the remaining AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar Systems as Government furnished equipment (GFE) to the contractor, at a rate specified by the contractor, to accomplish retrofit actions necessary to fulfill the terms of the DO.  Systems will be furnished to the contractor without ancillary equipment, Components of End Item (COEI), Basic Issue Items (BII), or 60 kilowatt (kw) prime power generators. The contractor is not responsible for the re-integration of ancillary equipment, COEI, BII, or generators prior to acceptance testing and delivery.  <br>    <br>  The IP system will be prepared by the Government at a Government facility for turn-over to the contractor for retrofit.  Prime movers of IP systems provided for retrofit will be inspected, maintained, and repaired prior to delivery to the contractor to ensure prime mover mechanical or electrical issues do not impact contractor production activities. Prime power generators will be separated from the IP system during this process.  <br>    <br>  The following items will be provided as Government furnished information (GFI).  On completion of acceptance testing of the retrofitted system, the contractor shall deliver the completed AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems with the following overpacked in each delivered VPC-95 Communications Subsystem Shelter:  <br>    <br>  a.

They do not meet a typical training barracks 2+2 configuration. The barracks are sub-standard; do not provide sufficient square footage. The barracks is also deficient in required power, communications, security and utilities. Ventilation is not in compliance with building codes and mold exists in the barracks presenting a continual health risk to the Cadets. The current barracks does not provide enough female latrines to accommodate the 16% female population.   <br>   The current HVAC, fire suppression, and infrastructure deficiencies negatively impact the health and security and safety of the Cadets. There is no air conditioning in the barracks. The current infrastructure will require substantial upgrades to meet current health, safety and security codes and requirements.   <br>      <br>

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 544 - Columbia, SC is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

THIS PROJECT IS TENTATIVELY SET TO BE ADVERTISED ON NOVEMBER 12, 2013 WITH A TENTATIVE BID OPENING DATE OF&nbsp;DECEMBER 11, 2013.</strong><br /><br />The Mooney Road project is located in Plumas County and in Lassen County on California Forest Highway (FH) 117 near Westwood, California. The project will provide resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation to 7.1 miles of roadway from approximate 1500 feet south of Swain Mountain Road to the intersection with California SR-44. Work will be suspended for approximately 3100 feet within the project limits from Station 723+43 to Station 754+10 for a realignment project to be designed and constructed under the authority of Lassen County.<br /><br />The major work elements include cold in-place recycle of the existing pavement to a depth of 3 &frac12; inches, subexcavation, asphalt surfacing of 3 inches, guardrail removal and installation, and selective tree thinning. Due to the elevation of the project, snow melt typically occurs in late Spring, and snow falls in late Fall, thus controlling commencement and termination of construction operations. All work is expected to take place between April, 2014 and early November, 2014. Temperature dependent work items such as cold in-place recycle, asphalt paving, and pavement marking must be completed in dry conditions, for which seasonal conditions are limited.<br /><br />The estimated cost of the proposed project is between $5 Million and $8 Million. <br /><br />Significant quantities include:<br /><br />Line Item Unit Estimated Quantity<br />Subexcavation CY 280<br />Selective Clearing SY 7,500<br />Roadway Aggregate TON 6,600<br />Hot Asphalt Conc.

The A-E firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.  All firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of interest; and FAR 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer firms.

This form must be completed and returned by those interested and eligible to submit proposals before access to restricted documents will be granted. In addition to completing this form, an electronic registration request must be submitted through <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>. The solicitation timeline (listed below) has also been revised. * <br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for U.S. Mission Germany. The U.S. Mission Germany requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>
<p>Due to the large dollar value and complexity of the U.S. Mission Germany Local Guard Program, the Department of State has determined the need to conduct a pre-solicitation conference before releasing the solicitation for this requirement. This conference will be used to highlight key areas of the solicitation, discuss issues that may affect prospective offerors ability to manage this contract, and show prospective slides of the place of performance (i.e., specific guard posts) of locations covered by this requirement in lieu of an actual "site visit" to each respective location. ATTENDANCE AT THIS PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE IS MANDATORY for any offeror who wants to submit a proposal for this requirement. This conference will be held at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, Germany at <strong>1:00 PM</strong> local on November 15, 2012.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in attending must preregister by contacting Amanda Rogers, rogersan@state.gov no later than 4:00 pm EDT, November 13, 2012. No more than three (3) representatives from each interested offeroring firm (to include potential joint venture partners) may attend the pre-proposal conference. Interested offerors shall provide the name (s) of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and DUNS number of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested offerors are solely responsible for ALL expenses resulting from this announcement (i.e. travel, lodging, per diem, proposal costs and other miscellaneous expenses, etc.) and are responsible for confirming all dates specified in this announcement by immediately checking the solicitation when posted on www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov to see if there are any changes.</p>
<p>In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

The purpose of this RFI is to explore the possibility of implementing a single Enterprise Converged Platform (ECP) that meets the requirements of both ESOC and GITM.&nbsp; The following sections individually describe the overall requirements of each program, but the solution presented in the response must focus on how these two areas, ESOC and GITM, will benefit together from a consolidated and converged solution.</span></p>

<DESC><p>This is a sources sought notice issued for the purpose of conducting market research. The U.S. Coast Guard, Surface Forces Logistics Center, Engineering Services Division (ISVS Branch), requires tear down, overhaul, and testing of nine (9) 140' TECO-Westinghouse Model A and Model B Direct Current (DC) Motors. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 811310, and the Small Business Size standard is $7.0 Mil.</p>
<p><br />Equipment Nomenclature: MOTOR, ELECT 900VDC, 2500HP, 245/305RPM<br />NSN: OC 6105-01-309-3793<br />REF NBR/EFD: A100073G01</p>
<p>The main propulsion motor is a single armature Westinghouse motor connected to the propulsion shafting by a flanged coupling. The motor is a DC, shunt-wound, separately-excited, compensated machine, rated at 2,500 HP. It is designed for full load rating continuously at an ambient temperature of 122 degrees F.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that only TECO-Westinghouse can provide the required Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts and overhaul the motors to proprietary OEM specifications, standards, and drawings, using OEM test procedures. The Coast Guard did not acquire this information, and it is our understanding, based on market research, that only the OEM has the proprietary data rights to the parts and technical data required to remanufacture these motors, converting the Model A motors to Model B motors, to meet the Coast Guard's needs.</p>
<p>Interested and capable sources should contact the Contracting Officer, Ashley Fetherman, at: Ashley.A.Fetherman@uscg.mil, demonstrating their interest and capability within five (5) calendar days from the posting date of this notice. Interested sources shall provide data showing that they have successfully overhauled the above motors for the Government or commercial customers in the past, or that they have unlimited access to the OEM's technical data, including specifications, drawings, and salient characteristics. The Government does not intend to pay for any information that is submitted in response to this synopsis. Information received after this period may not be considered.</p>

See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Vicksburg District (MVK), had a requirement for the manufacture of a new stator core for the Unit #1 hydroelectric generator at the DeGray Power Plant in Arkansas.  The MVK intended to issue a firm fixed price contract to Alstom Power Inc., 7901 Southpark Plz Ste 110, Littleton, CO, 80120, on a sole source basis.

Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2. Description of Action: Urgent procurement for Epicel-CEA grafts.  This action has an unusual and compelling urgency that could be detrimental to the patient's life as well as the hospital's overall medical mission. <br>  <br> 3. Description of Products/Services:  This requirement is for Epicel-CEA grafts needed for a patient in critical condition with over 50% total body surface area burns who will undergo surgery at San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC), FT Sam Houston, TX. <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited: Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), Soliciting competition.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency). <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a)(2), Exceptions. The unusual and compelling requirement will not be advertised. <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c)(1), Soliciting competition.  Price and availability will be obtained telephonically. <br>  <br> 5. Reason for Cited Authority: The above statutory authority is cited because this is a true, urgent request that has been verified by MS. Jackie Amaya, Burn Unit, OR and Janet Rindorf on 30 October 2013. The Epicel-CEA grafts must be laboratory grown and it takes nine days to prepare.  These grafts are for a burn patient that is in critical condition and needs multiple surgeries.  If the grafts are not grown and received as soon as possible, the patient's health will be compromised. <br>  <br> 6.
