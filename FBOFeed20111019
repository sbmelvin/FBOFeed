<ARCHDATE>11042011
<CONTACT>Michael Ottariano, Contracting Officer, Phone 2025645780, Email ottariano.michael@epa.gov
<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify potential offerors of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management's (OAM's) intent to issue a competitive small business set-aside solicitation to provide technical support to EPA's Air Toxics Program to reduce the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous air pollutants, reduce national non-cancer risks, and address risks that are disproportionately placed on specific subpopulations and geographic regions.</p>
<p>To accomplish these goals, the EPA has integrated its Air Toxics Program into four components. The first component is source specific regulatory programs. This component includes the development and review of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards under section 112(d), of the Clean Air Act (CAA), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources. The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA's Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics initiative. The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales, ranging from national-scale to local-scale assessments. The fourth and final component of EPA's air toxics program is education and outreach.</p>
<p>One purpose of this contract is to provide support for risk assessment activities associated with the first component of EPA's air toxics program. Within the context of this component, EPA evaluates the effects of hazardous and potentially hazardous air pollutants and develops appropriate regulatory strategies. In this role, EPA: (1) identifies, screens, and characterizes air pollutants to determine which should be evaluated further as candidates for being listed as hazardous; (2) reviews and evaluates health and/or ecological assessment documents on hazardous air pollutants; (3) performs risk assessments using EPA methods and models, or other methods and/or models, if more appropriate, to help guide reasoned decision-making; (4) identifies and evaluates alternative control options; (5) gathers information on production, use, emissions, control technology, control cost, and regulatory status to establish appropriate regulatory development priorities; (6) assesses the effectiveness of EPA and State/local programs in controlling hazardous and criteria pollutants; and (7) coordinates with other EPA offices and Federal and State/local programs to develop appropriate single or multimedia (e.g., air, water, solid waste, and/or other media) regulations.</p>
<p>Another purpose of this contract is to provide support for the second, third, and fourth components of EPA's air toxics program. In this role, EPA will develop assessment tools, conduct assessments, communicate the results of assessments, and educate the public. In addition, the EPA will examine the air pollution problem in a more integrated fashion (i.e., considering the cumulative effects of air toxics and criteria pollutants across media rather than conducting separate assessments). This contract will provide support for these integrated assessments.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Cost-Reimbursement Contract from this solicitation through a small business set-aside. The Government will issue work assignments from the resulting contract.

<SOLNBR>SOL-HQ-11-00045
<ARCHDATE>11042011
<CONTACT>Michael Ottariano, Contracting Officer, Phone 2025645780, Email ottariano.michael@epa.gov
<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify potential offerors of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management's (OAM's) intent to issue a competitive full and open solicitation to provide technical support to EPA's Air Toxics Program to reduce the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous air pollutants, reduce national non-cancer risks, and address risks that are disproportionately placed on specific subpopulations and geographic regions.</p>
<p>To accomplish these goals, the EPA has integrated its Air Toxics Program into four components. The first component is source specific regulatory programs. This component includes the development and review of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards under section 112(d), of the Clean Air Act (CAA), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources. The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA's Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics initiative. The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales, ranging from national-scale to local-scale assessments. The fourth and final component of EPA's air toxics program is education and outreach.</p>
<p>One purpose of this contract is to provide support for risk assessment activities associated with the first component of EPA's air toxics program. Within the context of this component, EPA evaluates the effects of hazardous and potentially hazardous air pollutants and develops appropriate regulatory strategies. In this role, EPA: (1) identifies, screens, and characterizes air pollutants to determine which should be evaluated further as candidates for being listed as hazardous; (2) reviews and evaluates health and/or ecological assessment documents on hazardous air pollutants; (3) performs risk assessments using EPA methods and models, or other methods and/or models, if more appropriate, to help guide reasoned decision-making; (4) identifies and evaluates alternative control options; (5) gathers information on production, use, emissions, control technology, control cost, and regulatory status to establish appropriate regulatory development priorities; (6) assesses the effectiveness of EPA and State/local programs in controlling hazardous and criteria pollutants; and (7) coordinates with other EPA offices and Federal and State/local programs to develop appropriate single or multimedia (e.g., air, water, solid waste, and/or other media) regulations.</p>
<p>Another purpose of this contract is to provide support for the second, third, and fourth components of EPA's air toxics program. In this role, EPA will develop assessment tools, conduct assessments, communicate the results of assessments, and educate the public. In addition, the EPA will examine the air pollution problem in a more integrated fashion (i.e., considering the cumulative effects of air toxics and criteria pollutants across media rather than conducting separate assessments). This contract will provide support for these integrated assessments.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Cost-Reimbursement Contract from this solicitation through full and open competition. The Government will issue work assignments from the resulting contract. The anticipated ordering period includes a twelve (12) month Base Period, and four (4), twelve (12) month option periods with a maximum potential ordering period totaling sixty (60) months. The total estimated level of effort for this requirement in professional labor hours for the Base Period and subsequent option periods is 5,000 hours, with an optional quantity for each contract period of 20,000, with a maximum potential of 125,000 hours.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 Million. This is not a request for submission of proposals. The solicitation for this procurement is anticipated to be released on or about November 2, 2011 with an award anticipated on April 1, 2012. The closing response date will be 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation. This procurement will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation. The contract award will be made using a best value approach, with technical capability being of greater importance than cost or price.</p>
<p>The synopsis, amendments, and other information related to this procurement as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, at: www.fbo.gov and the EPA website, at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1975 for the acquisition of an Illumina MiSeq System Integrated system for automated generation of DNA clonal clusters by bridge amplification and sequencing. The NHEERL Genomic Core lab has been equipped with an integrated Illumina HT HiScanSQ sequencing system including a scanner and microfluidics system components which provides comprehensive genomic services to EPA scientists. The Illumina MiSeq sequencer will be installed as a component of the Illumina sequencing platform which is part of the large GRC sequencing suite located in the NHEERL Genomic Core (GRC). As a part of the large GRC sequencing suite, the MiSeq system will allow QC validation of the library of sequencing samples before using it in the big HiScan SQ system and also to conduct small scale proof-of-concept studies prior to scaling up for more expensive and time consuming analysis on the large HiScanSQ system. The research application of the sequencing system requires that the flow cell be scanned on an integrated scanner. The image is displayed on a screen and analog software generates a density number for each gene to be used in the analysis. This resource of detailed analysis (provided by the Illumina MiSeq Genome Studio) will be part of an integrated workflow already established and presently used by the existing HiScanSQ system. Because of the unique sequencing chemistry applied by all parts of the Illumina sequencing suite, MiSeq will also allow performing targeted verification of the results from the large scale HiScanSQ whole genome sequencing experiments. No other existing bench top sequencing system on the market today has the unique sequencing chemistry used by the MiSeq system. Future experiments at NHEERL will generate data to be compared with existing Illumina data sets at the US EPA. Consistency in platform comparison is critical to the genomic scientific mission at NHEERL. Because of the unique sequencing chemistry based on bridge amplification this small scale bench top sequencing system is only supplied by Illumina. No other sources of supply exist on the market that meets this requirement. EPA has identified Illumina,Inc., the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302 1 only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written capabilities/specifications no later than 4:30pm EST, October 31, 2011. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02),RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, by fax (919) 685-3178 or by e-mail at smith.pamela@epa.gov . No telephone request will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for the purpose of conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet Air Force needs to develop, design, fabricate, and conduct flight demonstrations of an air vehicle integrated with an s-band bistatic radar receiver utilizing conformal loadbearing antenna structure (CLAS) technology.
<p>This notice is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.</p>
<p>This effort has two main objectives of equal priority. One objective is to demonstrate the air vehicle antenna integration efficiencies and the bistatic radar performance enabled by CLAS technology. The other objective is to conduct flight tests to demonstrate Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) mission performance improvements enabled by bistatic radar operations with a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). Bistatic radar operations have the potential to significantly increase the AWACS stand-off distance, coverage, and electronic protection (EP). CLAS technology can maximize bistatic radar performance by enabling integration of very large antenna arrays on an air vehicle. This effort will be conducted with support and guidance of Air Combat Command (ACC) and Electronics System Command (ESC) AWACS program offices to optimize potential for eventual transition to the operational fleet.</p>
<p>The program consists of two phases:</p>
<p>Phase I shall include the development of an operational system concept and definition of a flight demonstration program. The operational system concept includes identification of a bistatic receiver air vehicle platform, the AWACS and bistatic receiver air vehicle concept of operation (CONOPs), radar performance goals, and radar data processing and handling architecture. Definition of the flight demonstration program includes: identification and prioritization of current AWACS needs and requirements that will benefit from bistatic operations, bistatic radar performance trades studies including development of key performance parameters (KPPs), development of flight test scenarios, and identification of all resources necessary to execute the flight demonstrations including the CLAS concept, bistatic RPA platform, bistatic radar receiver and processor, surrogate AWACS radar, data links, data handling and processing, targets, threats, and overall cost and schedule.</p>
<p>Phase II is execution of the flight demonstration program including fabrication and integration of all necessary hardware, equipment, and software.</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOCs) reflecting their interest and capability in meeting the above requirements. Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical areas under consideration as outlined above, and on each of the following qualifications:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - provide an outline of relevant projects, specific work previously performed, or any in- house research and development effort or similar type work that is currently being performed.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is for the Government's informational purpose only in conducting Market Research. The results of this synopsis will help<br />the Government firm-up its requirements, develop its acquisition strategy<br />and determine set-aside possibilities in support of upcoming WOO&amp;LSS<br />efforts. Currently, the Government has a Sole Source award to Boeing<br />Satellite Systems, Incorporated for these requirements. The Space and<br />Missile Systems Center MILSATCOM Directorate (SMC/MC) is performing a market survey to determine if there are interested and qualified firms having the capabilities described below. The primary places of contract performance<br />are anticipated to be at Los Angeles, CA and Colorado Springs, CO.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />WGS Satellite-System Sustainment Engineering: The contracted effort shall provide iterative and recursive sustaining-maintenance engineering to continuously assess the operational technical health and safety of the on-orbit WGS satellite-subsystems (of which consists about 90% of a Boeing 702 Platform series) against its documented technical baseline (i.e. government limited rights) to include performance requirements and effectiveness, suitability, and risk measures. This effort shall monitor and collect the aggregation of all WOO&amp;LSS data inputs (e.g. telemetry, tracking and command data, maintenance discrepancy reports, feedback, system/component failure reports, and mishap data); analyze these data inputs and identify root causes and corrective actions (e.g. modifications, upgrades, changes to the product support package, process improvements, and enhancements) for safety and critical-readiness degrading issues based upon detailed WGS satellite-design knowledge; participate in trade studies and decision-making relative to the best resolution; consider the mission and satellite operational needs and the remaining expected service-life of the on-orbit WGS satellite; provide corrective actions (mitigation measures) which may include WGS flight software (RAM patch), Recommended Operations Procedure (ROP), or support/maintenance procedure changes; integrate the proposed corrective actions (mitigation measures) and test to verify operational safety, effectiveness and suitability; involves in-depth (regression, durability, structural, interoperability, support, etc.) satellite-system analyses to include the aspects of documentation, configuration, training, and maintenance; once authorized, implement and field the system corrective action along with adequate supplies, support, training, and maintenance procedures. Interoperability or technology improvements, parts or manufacturing obsolescence, aging satellite issues, premature failures, degrading fuel or lubricants, Joint or Service commonality, etc. may all indicate the need for changes to operational processes/procedures and the way satellite operations is supported. On-Orbit Satellite Operations &amp; Sustainment Support: Responsibilities will include daily technical support; data evaluation and trending; anomaly resolution (24/7 response/support); provision for the utilization of support tools and the WGS space-vehicle simulator (SATSIM) support (operation and maintenance, 24/7); provision for on-orbit data collection, calculations and analysis; maintain engineering liaison support with the WGS factory through the WGS Telemetry Room (WTR) in El Segundo, CA for anomaly resolution, disposal, and related activities necessary to support on-orbit WGS satellite operations; and update existing command plans, the Orbital Operations Handbook, and the Systems Engineering Handbook after resolution of on-orbit anomalies to assure integrity of continuing satellite operations. Space-vehicle engineering and technical support including hardware and software maintenance, and security activities is provided for the 3rd Satellite Operations Squadron (3SOPS) on-site at Schriever AFB, Colorado. Wideband SATCOM Systems-of-Systems Interoperability and Integration Support: Provide continuing support, as needed, to the WGS Constellation Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) for satellite-bus control; to the Global SATCOM Configuration Control Element (GSCCE) system that is used at each of the five Wideband SATCOM Operations Centers (WSOC) for communication-payload control; to the Common Network Planning Software (CNPS) that is used as the Wideband satellite communication resources planning tool; and to the Field Instruction/Information Release (FIIR) directives from the Wideband SATCOM System Expert (SSE) - ensuring compatibility with the on-orbit WGS satellites. Ensure this continuing Space Segment to Control Segment (i.e. bus and payload) interface compliance, via data exchange, integrated review, analysis, implementation, test and documentation of technical changes and incompatibilities. Support Space Segment to Control Segment integration for all upgrade activities affecting either segment. Ensure command procedures and databases are maintained to support on-orbit operations. Support, as needed, the International Partnership agreements as described by appropriate memoranda of understanding (MOU). Sustainment Infrastructure Support and Maintenance: Implement the product support package (designed with supporting the operations of the on-orbit WGS satellites in mind) to include the engineering hardware and software tools, equipment at the maintenance facilities (local and remote), test beds, terrestrial-communication networks/links, factory antennas, data storage, the WGS Telemetry Room (WTR), the Mission Unique Software (MUS), and the WGS SATSIM. This effort entails utilizing, maintaining, upgrading, improving, enhancing, providing and administrating (as necessary) all material, licenses, warranties, hardware and software equipment inclusive of the sustainment infrastructure in order to not only keep these items and facilities operational but also ensure all other WOO&amp;LSS capabilities as described above are successfully performed. Interested parties are invited to submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) within 20 Business&nbsp;days of this announcement that addresses the ability to satisfy the above requirements to SMC/SL/PKL, Attn: Kimberly McGough, 1050 E Stewart Avenue Bldg 2025, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-2902 2902 (e-mail: kimberly.mcgough@peterson.af .mil).

<DESC>Service:  Sources Sought to perform Monitoring, Analysis and Assessment Services on an Electricity Generation Project  
This is a Sources Sought announcement for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All eligible and qualified contractors may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the quantity and availability of contractors who have the technical level of expertise, administrative and management capability to perform the effort described below.  The capability statements received will be used to help determine The Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) overall procurement strategy.   
Reclamation has a requirement for an independent analysis and assessment of the effectiveness of current marketing and use of power strategies employed by Reclamation and parties involved in the Navajo Project.  The Navajo Project's primary features are the Navajo Generating Station (NGS) located near Page, Arizona and the Western and Southern Navajo 500 kV transmission systems.  Electrical power generated from NGS serves the pumping requirements of the Central Arizona Project and any surplus power remaining is marketed.   The services sought will require a professional understanding of power marketing and related aspects.  Work will include analyzing each and every  sales/exchange/shaping transaction and reviewing operating procedures for scheduling, balancing (ramping, regulation, reserves, plant and pumping curtailments), pump shaping, finance management loss accounting, and transmission management.  These services will be required for approximately one and one half years beginning January 1, 2012. It is unlikely that this work would require a lot of traveling, except for the occasional visit to Reclamation's Boulder City office.    
The primary objective is for Reclamation to obtain an unbiased assessment on how the Navajo Project is currently being managed, particularly with respect to our effectiveness in maximizing surplus power availability and revenue.  Also the assessment shall document any potential improvements.   The assessment requires data gathering from many sources including Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District, Western Area Power Administration (Western), Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Southwest Transco, ACES Power Marketing, and others.  
A methodology for monitoring, analysis and assessment must be developed and approved addressing how data will be compiled and managed.  Monthly monitoring and status reports will also be required and include recommendations for improvement when observed.  Also required will be a final comprehensive report with supporting documentation and at least two formal presentations effectively communicating findings and recommendations.  
Responsible sources are welcome to submit a capability statement on or before 12:00 P.M. November 1, 2011.  Submittals will be reviewed and considered by Reclamation during the solicitation planning process.  Send your capability package by email to Liz Bailey at eebailey@usbr.gov  or mail them to Liz's attention at P.O. Box 61470 (LC-10116), Boulder City, NV 89006-1470.  Your package should include the following information:
1. Capability statement - showing recent experience doing this type of work or work similar in scope and complexity.2. Provide your business name, address, point of contact, phone number and email address3. Provide your business size & type: 8(a), HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business or Large Business.  Firms should identify whether or not they are a small business or other than small business in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541330 (Engineering Services). The size standard is $4.5 Million.  Firms may also provide recommendation for use of an alternate NAICS code.

<DESC><p>Description: <br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time. No response will be provided to requests for a solicitation. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) mission is to safeguard America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yield Explosives [CBRNE]) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate, and counter the threat, and mitigate its effects. DTRA's Research and Development Enterprise is the focal point for identifying and developing innovative technologies to combat WMD and is responsible for designing, testing, and demonstrating emerging technologies to be adopted by the Services, Combatant Commands, and other agencies. Following guidance and operational concepts of senior DoD officials, the Research and Development Enterprise provides solutions across the full range of CBRNE WMD technologies.</p>
<p>DTRA currently has a requirement to develop and maintain meteorological systems for support to consequence assessment and management (CA/CM) functions. DTRA's current systems are composed of:</p>
<p>1. A high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) system based on the NCAR/Penn State MM5; and <br />2. A 24/7/365 meteorological data server (MDS) system and Weather Client software application.</p>
<p>The NWP system generates mesoscale forecasts over user-configurable locations and time periods and at a variety of horizontal (typically 12, 4, and 1.33 km) and vertical resolutions. The MDS retrieves, processes, stores, and serves observational data along with gridded NWP data from a variety of internal and external sources (e.g., the National Center for Environmental Prediction [NCEP], the Air Force Weather Agency [AFWA], and the US Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorological and Oceanographic Center [FNMOC]). These systems are located on Ft Belvoir, VA and Kirtland AFB, NM on both DoD unclassified and classified networks and systems. Therefore, they must meet DoD information assurance standards.</p>
<p>The requirement is to build upon existing operational and research and development (R&amp;D) meteorological computing platforms and prototype capabilities through research, design, development, engineering, publication, and upgrade of methodologies and technologies. The DTRA operational NWP capability must be made available on-demand in a "cold-start" mode meaning that potential operators of the system (i.e., engineers and scientists) not necessarily versed in the details of NWP should be provided with the ability to initialize an NWP forecast, verify the output, and process results that are operationally compatible with DTRA and DoD atmospheric transport and dispersion (ATD) codes (e.g., the Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability [HPAC], the Integrated WMD Toolset [IWMDT], and the Joint Effects Model [JEM]). The MDS system must be capable of serving weather data to 1000 simultaneous users, ensuring data is parsed, formatted, and transmitted successfully within five minutes. In addition, Weather Client software compatible with DTRA and DoD CA/CM systems that directly access MDS must be maintained and further developed. Both the NWP and MDS systems reside on DoD classified and unclassified networks and must meet DoD information assurance standards and be PKI and CAC accessible.</p>
<p>The end-state goal is a comprehensive meteorological capability to serve DTRA and DoD CA/CM functions. The end system must include both an in-house, high-resolution NWP capability and the ability to serve NWP and observational data in appropriate formats seamlessly and securely to DTRA and DoD customers.</p>
<p>The following are projected task areas:</p>
<p>Research, Development, and Integration:<br />a) Conduct NWP research including effect of resolution on ATD, optimal mesoscale ensemble configuration and use in ATD applications, verification and validation methods/implementation and graphical display.<br />b) Conduct MDS research including methods for determination of "typical day" atmospheric conditions and best performing NWP models.<br />c) Conduct R&amp;D of processes to assist in the selection of appropriate meteorological data based on defined CBRNE scenarios and model performance or meteorological observation data density.<br />d) Conduct R&amp;D of processes to retrieve oceanographic data for use in water bourn transport and dispersion tools such as Incident Command Tool for Drinking Water Protection (ICWater) and System for Hazard Assessment of Released Chemicals (SHARC).<br />e) Conduct R&amp;D of high-resolution climatology information for user defined domains.<br />f) Conduct research on the effects of climate change on emerging infectious diseases in support of global biosurveillance efforts.<br />g) Explore, investigate, and design new methods for creating, capturing, storing, assessing, and modifying large amounts of meteorological data. This may include dynamically accessing in-house NWP systems and external providers. <br />h) Provide technical assistance/training on the use and maintenance of the MDS and NWP systems as well as assist in the incorporation/installation of upgrades/patches to the system at both locations.<br />i) Develop and assist in the integration of Weather Client software into DTRA and DoD CA/CM tools.</p>
<p>System Administration/Maintenance:<br />a) Provide 24/7/365 on-site or remote system support.<br />b) Deliver on-site system hardware/software upgrades. Provide recommendations on the state of the art, to include developmental, hardware and software to enhance daily operations<br />c) Assist in the migration to virtualization on the DTRA "Mission Enclave" of the existing and any developed systems.<br />d) Provide systems monitoring tools to include systems performance and production in the case of the NWP, and status of ingest, parsing, formatting and transmission of data for the MDS. <br />e) Maintain awareness of current meteorological products and make recommendations for addition of new grids / observation to enhance operations.<br />f) Perform Information Assurance duties to include: vulnerability assessments, threat assessments, mitigation, and reporting activities in order to provide safeguards of information. <br />g) Maintain and administer user accounts for all meteorological systems on both the unclassified and classified networks.</p>
<p>Travel:<br />a) Travel to the DTRA and its customer sites will be required for meetings, technical direction/discussions, training, system upgrades, and installation of Life Cycle Management (LCM) high-performance computer(s) and software.</p>
<p>Security:<br />a) An active secret level (minimum) security clearance will be necessary for access and maintenance of DTRA systems.</p>
<p>Subject Matter Expertise:<br />Be available and able to provide key subject-matter expertise to support DTRA Reachback analysts, Combatant Commands, and other federal, state, and local agencies with technical advice during exercises and operational needs as they pertain to the meteorological system and its workings. Additionally, support and train subject-matter experts that will be using the system for exercises and real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>General Instruction:<br />Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting experience related to the above areas. Responses shall indicate whether the above described services are available through an existing government contract and if so, identify the contract and provide contact data for the Government point of contact managing that contract.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) posted a request for information (RFI) onMay 23, 2011, Solicitation Number:  RFI-2011NCCS  and Reference Number:  2011NCCS, foridentifying potential sources for specialized high-end computing support services to theSciences Directorate.  This is a follow-on acquisition to the NASA Center for ClimateSimulation (NCCS) procurements.This RFI reflects changes to the RFI-2011NCCS posting.	The first of the changes is tothe NAICS Code from 541712  Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, andLife Sciences (except Biotechnology), to 541513  Computer Facilities ManagementServices.  Another change is to the title of the follow-on procurement to Computationaland Information Science and Technology Office  Scientific Computing and TechnicalServices (CISTO-SCTS).	The draft Statement of Work (SOW) has been expanded from theprevious release to include administrative and resource analyst support to CISTO; Scienceand Engineering Network (SEN) support, user liaisons and communications; support foradvanced data publications, analysis, and visualization; and purchasing of IT productsfor CISTO.  The additional content may be support currently provided under differentcontracts and may be issued under this procurement as deemed necessary, not necessarilyat the start of the contract awarded under this procurement.  The revised draft SOW isprovided as a point of reference.As a result of the change of the NAICS code, NASA GSFC is hereby soliciting informationabout potential sources for specialized high-end computing support services to theSciences Directorate.

TMS authorized representatives are the only known sources who have possession of design data, material specifications, proprietary information and historical operating parameters relating to the repair of the panels. The use of non-OEM parts and/or non OEM authorized service representatives will jeopardize reliable and safe plant operation and may result in personal injury or severe equipment damage.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: THIS NOTICE IS MARKET RESEARCH TO SUPPORT INCLUSION OF A SOLE SOURCE (BRAND NAME) SPECIFICATION IN VARIOUS FY12 CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The U.S. Army Engineer District, Alaska intends to specify the below listed item as part of larger construction contracts to be executed on various military installations throughout the State of Alaska. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Reference FAR 6.302-1(c), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".
<p>ITEM: Intelligent Parking Lot Controllers (ILPC) from Intelligent Parking Lot Controller Corp. of Manitoba, Canada. THIS NOTICE IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No solicitation will be available as this sole source item will be incorporated into the specifications of FY12 solicitations for new Military Construction (MILCON) facilities throughout Alaska. The ILPC is a smart power receptacle which controls the amount of power supplied to engine block heaters that are used to warm engines in cold climate environments. The IPLC has a microprocessor that controls the flow of power to the block heater according to several factors including temperature, wind chill and time. The IPLC is factory programmed to automatically regulate optimum power flow to ensure strong engine starts at any temperature. By not supplying constant power, the intelligent operation reduces energy consumption costs by up to 65 percent. Each IPLC handles two outlets and each can be individually programmed to prevent use of in-car heaters or to meet the special needs of diesel engines or emergency vehicles. Red/green LEDs instantly indicate the status of the power outlet and user equipment including: a live outlet, a functioning block heater, an open or short circuit in the block heater or a circuit overload from an in-car heater. <br /><br />Salient features of the IPLC include: <br />A. Automatically controls the amount of electricity supplied based on ambient air temperature, wind chill and time. <br />B. Totally programmable via computer software to vary the amount of electricity supplied based on temperature.<br />C. Built-in microprocessor which keeps track of energy consumed with or without the use of the controller and provision to download data from the microprocessor.<br />D.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, is soliciting comments for the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Ft. Campbell, KY area.  The project consists of designing and constructing an MH-47 aviation maintenance hangar including maintenance bays, shops, company administration, platoon offices, aviation operations, locker room and storage areas (approximately 104,900 SF).  A 90% civil site design and electrical supply design will be provided. The project will include an MH-47 parking ramp, C-17 unloading ramp, existing TACAN relocation, information systems, fire protection/alarm systems, Energy Monitoring and Control Systems (EMCS) connection, protected distribution system (PDS), intrusion detection, surveillance, and electronic access control.  Supporting facilities will include all related site-work and utilities (electrical, water, gas, sanitary sewer, and information systems distribution), lighting, parking, curb and gutter, sidewalks, storm drainage, landscaping, and other site improvements.  The project will include construction of the new electrical power supply from an existing substation. Special construction includes sustainable construction features complying with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) "Silver".  Access for persons with disabilities will be provided.  Comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design and audio visual services are included.  <br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>Request responses to the following questions:<br>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the Ft. Campbell, KY area?<br>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract?<br><br>Responses shall be submitted via email to Crystal May at crystal.m.may@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 PM EST on 02 November 2011.<br><br>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting a market survey to obtain information on responsible sources that have the capability to provide Mobile Corrosion Rehabilitation Services (MCRF) support services, and if those support services are available via a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract.  MARCORSYSCOM has a potential requirement for MCRF support services and believes that there are large, small, and 8a businesses that have the capability to provide these support services.  MCRF support services will be performed on Marine Corps ground tactical and support equipment designed to extend the useful service life of these assets to include reducing maintenance requirements due to corrosion damage that cannot be performed at the operator level.
 Mobile Corrosion repair services include, but are not limited to; (1) Cleaning; (2) Surface Preparation; (3) Minor Body Repair; (4) Painting, Registration Marking, and Undercoating; (5) Rust Inhibitor Application; (6) Compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), State and Local laws and regulations and Marine Corps policies and procedures; (7) Corrosion Assessments to identify the Corrosion Category of assets upon receipt and following completion of MCRF services; and (8) MCRF Program Management activities. A primary intent of this work is to restore the condition of the equipment to a new coating condition and apply corrosion / abrasion resistant undercoatings and bedliners to USMC tactical and support equipment.
  As a field level application, the intent is to mitigate corrosion of the equipment, with minimal disassembly, via surface preparation and reapplication of the approved Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) system.   This work is expected to be carried out as a mobile team.  The team is expected to mobilize to/from various sites to provide the requested services.  At each site the vendor is expected to have the capability to erect temporary shelters to perform the work required and protect the equipment from exposure to inclement weather during the corrosion repair process. The MCRF is not intended to replace the capabilities of a fixed facility but instead perform MCRF services as an overflow on identified equipment to allow more major repair at Marine Corps fixed facilities.
  The support services shall be performed primarily at the following Marine Corps Installations: I MEF, II MEF, III MEF Hawaii, and Marine Force Reserve locations within Continental United States (CONUS).  The U.S. Marine Corps will use the results of this announcement to determine what capabilities exist in the marketplace.  MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request for information.  Interested firms are requested to submit a response in a Microsoft Office compatible format, not to exceed 10 pages, outlining their ability to meet or exceed the requirements identified above by no later than 4:00 PM Local  Time, 29 October 2011.
  Firms should also include their business size/type, and management plan, if applicable.  Only electronic submissions will be accepted.  Interested sources shall send responses via e-mail to andrias.woody@usmc.mil.  DO NOT CALL MR. WOODY.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY SERVICES/ITEMS.

<a href="mailto:michelle.a.timmons.civ@mail.mil">DLA Aberdeen (ACC-APG)</a>
<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) not a request for proposal (RFP). The US Army Product Director, Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PD PNT) is seeking sources to provide a family of PNT solutions for US Army and Joint Service applications.  The common component of these items is a SAASM-based GPS receiver.<br><br>This RFI identifies multiple capabilities and interested parties are invited to respond to any or all of the PNT devices described below, or any portion of the devices described below.  The target date for contract award varies by the item described based on complexity of concept. <br><br>1) PNT HUB PHASE I  <br>     A sealed enclosure containing a SAASM-based GPS receiver for terrestrial applications (host platform) with connectors for external power, antenna and electrical interfaces.  Specific aerial applications may also be considered.  PNT Hub Phase I is intended to mimic the functionality of an AN/PSN-13A Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) and not require any changes to host platform software currently utilizing DAGR as an external source of PNT data.  The connectors and external data interfaces shall be of the standard design utilized by DAGR such that the PNT Hub can effectively substitute for DAGR in a DAGR mount and connect to DAGR accessory cables. <br><br>     PNT Hub Phase I shall route PNT data for external devices with a minimum threshold of up to 3; objective up to 4.  A technical document identifying the sub-set of standard DAGR Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to PNT Hub Phase I is TBD.  This subset of technical documents is estimated to be 80% of the current full PRF and ICD.<br>Desired Product Availability - FY12.<br>   <br>2) PNT HUB PHASE II<br> A sealed enclosure containing a SAASM-based GPS receiver for terrestrial and potential aerial applications.  Connectors for external power, antenna and multiple electrical interfaces including Ethernet such that it can provide PNT capability on a host platform(s).  The PNT Hub Phase II would incorporate circuitry to prioritize and route PNT data with a minimum threshold of 6, objective greater than 6 external devices.  PNT capability enhancements are envisioned, to include, but not limited to:  precise timing devices (ie. chip scale atomic clock), inertial measurement units, external augmentation software, Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna/Anti-Jam antenna integration, etc.<br><br>     It is acknowledged that the PNT Hub Phase II may require modification of host platform software to accommodate the shared PNT source.  A technical document identifying the standard Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to PNT Hub Phase II is TBD.  The technical documents for PNT Hub Phase II will maintain the basic PNT functionality.  A COTS wireless interface (WiFi/Bluetooth) is contemplated for output of PNT data to external devices.<br> Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>3) EMBEDDABLE GPS RECEIVER IN MINI-GROUND BASED RECEIVER APPLICATIONS MODULE (MINI-GB-GRAM)<br>  <br>     A chip-mounted SAASM-based GPS receiver that can be integrated/embedded to a host platform mother board or delivered (optionally) installed to a circuit card such that it can substitute for an SSI-GB-GRAM in the Type II SSI form factor.  GRAM is an open architecture specification that provides a non-proprietary definition of hardware and software for embeddable SAASM-based GPS receivers. The current production item is the Small Serial Interface (SSI) GB-GRAM.  The Mini-GB-GRAM would supplement not replace the current production item and is intended for application that cannot be supported by the SSI-GB-GRAM due to size constraints.  The nominal dimensions of Mini-GB-GRAM are not to exceed 1.5 x 1.5 inches.<br><br>     The delivery option provides the opportunity to order Mini-GB-GRAM in a form factor that can substitute for current production item but not be limited to current design or interface parameters.  A technical document identifying the sub-set of standard GB-GRAM Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to Mini-GB-GRAM is TBD.  This subset of technical documents are estimated to be 60% of the current full PRF and ICD.  The potential for a family of products to support terrestrial, aerial and precision guided munitions domains are envisioned.  Separate products to support separate domains are acceptable.  <br> Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>4) SAASM INTEGRATION TO COMMERCIAL SMARTPHONE<br>PD PNT seeks input on how best to integrate SAASM to commercial smartphones, e.g., a cradle containing SAASM that would physically connect to a smartphone or a separate device containing SAASM that would interface wirelessly to the smartphone. <br>Key factors: <br><br> 	Use of IS-GPS-153 (open architecture) data constructs<br> 	Full IS-GPS-153 compliant messages is a desired feature<br> 	Use of commercial open architecture wired or wireless interfaces<br>             ~USB <br>             ~Bluetooth or WiFi <br> 	Wireless interface must support encryption<br> 	Smartphone OS is Android open source<br> 	A Droid app to interface with & control  the SAASM module is desired  <br>Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation to Bid, Request for Quotation or Request for Proposal.  Additionally there is no obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. <br />(i) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iii) The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates three WP-3 Lockheed Orion aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these WP-3 Lockheed Orion aircraft will be based out of the Halifax, Canada area to be operated in support of critical winter storm / ocean wind related research. Due to winter weather conditions in the Halifax area, it is necessary that the P-3 aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period January 16, 2012 through February 16, 2012. The hangar will protect the aircraft and it's instrumentation from the environment as well as protects the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities through the winter months.</p>
<p>SCOPE: <br />NOAA WP-3 Orion aircraft will be operating out of Halifax, Canada in support of winter storms/ocean winds research. There will be several NOAA WP-3 mechanics in Halifax supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one P-3 will be required in the hangar.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) WP-3 Lockheed Orion having a wing span of 100 feet, length 116 feet and 39 feet high at the tail. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security clause 1352.239-72 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1) Ground support equipment use including:<br />a) AC and DC external power unit,<br />b) Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c) Tow vehicle and driver for aircraft movement in and out of hangar. <br />2) Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, consumables, phones, heat and DC power,<br />3) 24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4) Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft x 5 ft,<br />5) Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from January 16, 2012 through February 16, 2012. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than February 16, 2012. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoTitle"><span>Statement of Work</span></p>
<p class="MsoTitle"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates India&rsquo;s marine resources potential to be about 3.93 million tons. Unfortunately, there are limited fisheries management initiatives in practice in India today leading to overfishing concerns in inland fisheries. India has the second largest shark fishery in the world, but no International Plan of Action.<span>&nbsp; </span>Further, cyclic and climatological fluctuations affect the status of pelagic stocks. Given India&rsquo;s impetus on fisheries and critical lack of data on fisheries stock assessments, impact of climate change and Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), there is a need for research on Indian fisheries. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In recent years, there has been periodic dialogue and interaction between NMFS and Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) scientists. As a result of these interactions, several exciting projects have emerged. However, the development and implementation of these project proposals require dedicated and directed efforts of a NMFS contractor to engage in a productive dialogue with Indian counterparts in coordination with NMFS Office of Science and Technology.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a recent strategic ally of the United States with a widening economy and growing investment in scientific endeavors including Earth observations, India offers new and ample opportunities for data sharing, two-way capacity building, and access to local resources for NOAA.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is particularly important given the relatively scarce NOAA resources in the region.<span>&nbsp; </span>The NOAA&rsquo;s objectives for India hinge both on access to data as well as leveraging India&rsquo;s growing leadership role in Asia and the world for mutual benefit.<span>&nbsp; </span>NOAA&rsquo;s research mission will benefit from increased investment in the largely unexplored Indian Ocean Basin Region. India is 17% of the world&rsquo;s population and is a valued asset in working together or separately in building capacity, particularly in South and Southeast Asian nations.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>NOAA has a strong partnership with Indian science counterparts and has signed major agreements for collaboration in earth observations and earth sciences through the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and MoES. There are also plans underway to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the India Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF).</span> The NOAA-MoES relationship in particular has grown into a broad and fruitful partnership on earth observations and sciences since signing the MoU in 2008. Under the MoU, both agencies are working together to develop several implementing arrangements to further these activities.<span>&nbsp; </span>These arrangements address critical societal issues from improved ocean, weather &amp; climate observation and prediction capabilities to enhanced monsoon forecasts for the agricultural community, flood control, and water supply monitoring. <span>However, there is increasing scope to engage on matters related to living marine resources.</span></p>

THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE OFFERS AND AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFERORS (EXCEPT CLARIFICATIONS AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 15.306(A)).  THEREFORE, THE OFFERORS INITIAL OFFER SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS FROM A PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER LATER DETERMINES THEM TO BE NECESSARY.  IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE EXCEEDS THE NUMBER AT WHICH AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION CAN BE CONDUCTED, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE TO THE GREATEST NUMBER THAT WILL PERMIT AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION AMONG THE MOST HIGHLY RATED PROPOSALS.

Factor 1: Corporate Experience
Factor 2: County of San Diego Solid Waste Management Agreement

Volume II. Technical Proposal: (original & 3 copies).  Address each of the following evaluation factors shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation: Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4.

While all proposed pricing will be fully evaluated in accordance with the RFP price evaluation criteria, the Government will consider only the sum total of the prices proposed for the following Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs) to determine reasonableness, realism, and completeness for the purpose of performing any required analysis to determine the offeror proposing the best value to the Government: 

Base Year: 
FFP (ELINs A001 through A011)
IDIQ (ELINs A012 through A034)
Option 1:
FFP  (ELINs B001 through B011)

Option 2:
FFP  (ELINs C001 through C011)
IDIQ (ELINs C012 through C034)

In the event there is a difference between a unit price and the extended total amount, the unit price will be held to be the intended price and the total of the ELINs will be recomputed accordingly.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity
in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's
procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering
activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have
been solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the
information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)
Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if
this is an item you have never made.
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS
submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request
for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required
by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award
under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval
request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval
requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet
Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based
on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification
Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br><br>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,<br><br>(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br><br>(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br><br>(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br><br>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br><br>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br><br>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br><br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br><br><br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence., 2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence., 3. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act., 4. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the State's Workmen's Compensation Law (or its equivalent) for all places of performance under this contract.  The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured.
WELDING CERTIFICATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS  - This solicitation may contain welding line items as either Definitive or Optional Items. With his/her quote the Contractor shall provide the necessary welding certifications and qualifications as required by the specification for the applicable work item(s), and SFLC Standard Specification 0740_STD. 
MAY BE CONSIDERED INCOMPLETE AND MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED QUOTES MUST INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED IN THIS SOLICITATION (WELDING CERTIFICATES,  DRYDOCK CERTIFICATION, PAST PERFORMANCE, ETC).  QUOTES THAT DO NOT INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED
GROWTH WORK
(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.
(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.
(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.
COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: -The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.
(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:
(1) direct labor wages and salaries;(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;
(6) profit (fee); and(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions: Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating;
Material Handling Housekeeping; Engineering Transportation/Drivers; Quality Assurance Contract Administration; Security Testing
(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.
(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:
Commandant (CG-9131),United States Coast Guard Headquarters, Procurement Planning & Oversight Division, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0203,Washington, DC 20593-0001,Telephone: (202) 372-3695, Fax: (202) 475-3904
Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) Rating: DO A3.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001</p>

In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p>COMMANDANT CG-9121(WS)<br />U.S. COAST GUARD <br />2100 2ND Street, SW STOP 7112 <br />Washington, DC 20593-7112<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>
<p><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AMENDMENT&nbsp;1</strong></span></p>
<p>1) The solicitation's response deadline is extended from 1400 ET, on October 19, 2011 to 1400 ET, on October 21, 2011.</p>
<p>2) Alternative sources for this requirement have been identified. The Government no longer intends to conduct a sole source award. This is now a competitive solicitation.</p>
<p>3) Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items has been changed as follows:</p>
<p>i.Technical Acceptability: Offerors must submit documentation that reflects compliance with the attached specification; the Government will evaluate each vendor's compliance with the attached specification to determine acceptability.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001</p>

<DESC>This amendment provides the Government response to vendor questions that may assist in developing a response to this RFI.  All ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THE VENDOR COMMUNITY HAS SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE VENDOR'S RFI RESPONSE.  The questions below and all additional questions that are submitted with the Vendor's RFI response will assist the Government in its final version of the SOW should this RFI result in a future solicitation.
1.	Have you decided on / Do you have a preference for a cloud provider? We understand that "FISMA-moderate" already precludes some providers. Government Response:  The Department is seeking the vendor to provide the SaaS solution which includes the FISMA moderate cloud environment.  The department does not currently have a preference.
2.	 Do you have a preference for a software platform/language? Government Response:  No, since this is a SaaS solution
3.	Do you have a preference for open-source vs. proprietary software? Government Response:  No, since this is a SaaS solution
4.	Do you have an approximate implementation timeline? Government Response:  This information is not currently available.
5.	Are there skillsets already available in the organization that this project can leverage?Government Response:  This information is not currently available.
6.	Using these technologies will make it easier for the project to transition to O&M phase. What is the approximate data volume in the data sources? Government Response:  This information is not currently available.
7.	What are the data latency requirements for the dashboard? Does the data need to be up to date to-the-hour, to-the-day, to-the-week? Government Response:  This will vary based on the line business need.
8.	Approximately how much data (in terms of Gigabytes) needs to move on a daily/hourly basis? Government Response:  This information is not currently available.
9.	Is there a single-sign-on system already in place? What technology is being used for this? Government Response:  The Department has a FICAM policy and prefers a SAML single sign-on connection.
10.	Will this system be accessed only from on-site government facilities, or should it be accessible from anywhere? Government Response:  This information is not currently available.
11.	Does the dashboard need to be accessible from mobile devices? Government Response:  Yes
12.	Please clarify these statements in the SOW - Draft for Vendor comment attachment:  "SaaS solution set-up, installation and connection to the DOI network for single sign-on. 30 days ARO" Is the solution expected to be up and running in 30 days ARO? Government Response:	Yes, the government assume since this would be a SaaS solution that the environment would simple need to be made available.
13.	This sentence in the "SOW Draft for Vendor Comment" attachment, page 10, Item 1 in table. Are these the final Security Compliance requirements? "The Contractor must provide a federal community cloud SaaS solution that is at a minimum FISMA moderate or MAC II certified NIST Compliant, (800-37 current Rev, 800-53 current Rev, 800-34 current Rev) and have a working knowledge of all related NIST standards" 	Government Response:  These represent the current defined requirements in the RFI. Should the vendor community take issue with this, it should be included in the RFI response with supported reasoning to assist the Government  in understanding the issue.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION <br />RQ Number: 21000-11-6112 &amp; 6034<br />J&amp;A Number: 0098
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C.501) Multiple Award Schedule Program FAR 8.401 and is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 8.405-6 (b) (1).</p>
<p>1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Limited Sources Justification."</p>
<p>This is a limited sources justification for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Secretary, SEC Library, 100 F Street, N.E., Station Place, Washington, D.C. 20549. The acquisition will be conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, pursuant to FAR 8.401. The Contracting Activity responsible for this action is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Acquisitions, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312-2416.</p>
<p>2. Nature and Description of Action Being Approved:</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a requirement on a limited source basis for print legal publications to Thomson West (West), Eagan, Minnesota. This is a contract renewal.</p>
<p>3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the needs of the SEC and the estimated value:</p>
<p>The requirement is for print legal publications and their updates published by West. These publications include federal and state legal information, statutes and administrative rules and regulations, handbooks, reporters, treatises, and loose-leaf upkeep services. The publisher shall ship print legal publications to SEC staff per SEC instructions.</p>
<p>The estimated contract value for this requirement is $667,752.00, for a period of performance of October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012. This contract action covers two requirements; one is for previously published items during 2010 and 2011 and another for upcoming publications from 2011 to 2012.</p>
<p>4. Identification of the Justification and Rationale.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-6 (b)(1): (b)(1). Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work. See paragraph 6, below.</p>
<p>5. Determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the anticipated order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d).</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has determined that issuing the proposed Task Order to West represents the best value and will result in the lowest overall cost alternative, considering price and administrative costs, to meet the Government's needs. This order will be placed in accordance with FAR 8.404 - Use of Federal Supply Schedules. General Services Administration has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing. Prior to issuance of the task order, the ordering activity may consider other factors in determining that the total price is reasonable.<br /><br />6. Description of a market survey conducted and results or statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.</p>
<p>A formal market survey was not conducted because West is the only Contractor that can provide the required publications.</p>
<p>The required publications are published only by West and West holds the copyright for their content. The uniqueness of the information, combined with the copyright protection, makes West the only known source. The mission of the SEC requires its staff to have access to all specialized legal publications to perform their official duties in the fields it regulates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Other Supporting Facts:</p>
<p>While some of these publications may be available online, print copies are needed when the item is used for frequent referral, to take to meetings and discuss, to make marginal notes, or where there are transactional charges to view the online version, or the online version does not have pagination which is needed for proper citation by most courts.</p>
<p>8. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>The Commission's information requirements are ongoing and we will continue to perform market research for future acquisitions for the purpose of verifying the sole source nature of this acquisition.</p>
