<DESC>Synopsis Description The Department of Energy (DOE), Ohio Field Office, intends to issue a sole source modification for interim requirements for a period up to twelve months pending completion of a competitive acquisition to safely and economically maintain and monitor the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP), and perform facilities operation and site support services which include the following: operate the Remote Handled Waste Facility (RHWF); characterize, process, package and ship for disposal legacy Class A low level waste (LLW) and waste generated as a result of other activities conducted under the Statement of Work; maintain and monitor facilities; and continue to store the high level waste (HLW) canisters in the Main Plant Process Building in a manner that is safe and compliant with DOE requirements. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The present contract is with the West Valley Nuclear Services Company and is due to expire on December 31, 2004.  Site services need to continue without disruption in order to assure the protection of the workers, the public, and the environment.  The shipment of legacy Class A LLW and operation of RHWF are necessary to meet the requirements of the WVDP Act and maintain the qualified and experienced workforce. Therefore, this necessitates the award of a sole source modification/extension to the incumbent contractor, West Valley Nuclear Services Company.  The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide the necessary site services from January 1, 2005 for up to 12 months until award and transition to competitive contract(s) for site services occurs.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE RECEIVING RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE OF A NON-COMPETITIVE ACTION. IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT. Interested parties believing they have all the capabilities described above may submit capability statements to be received within five days of publication of this notice. Any such responses should be directed to: U.S. Department of Energy, Ohio Field Office, 175 Tri-County Parkway, Springdale, OH 45246-3222, Attention: Derrick J. C. Franklin.

Each submission will be reviewed in accordance with the minimum requirements listed for each factor.  After review of each submission, each potential offeror will be advised, in writing, by GSA either that it is invited to participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP) step of this procurement, or based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  Notwithstanding the advice given by GSA, all potential offerors responding to step one will be advised that they may participate in the next step of this procurement process.  FIRMS THAT DO NOT SUBMIT WRITTEN RESPONSES TO THIS PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE IN SUBSEQUENT STEPS OF THIS PROCUREMENT.

RFP Step

The second step of this procurement will be the issuance of a Request for Proposal package to all potential offerors found to be viable competitors under the initial step of the procurement.  Should a potential offeror who was found to be a nonviable competitor request a copy of the RFP package, the Government will provide it.  Upon issuance of the RFP, potential offerors will be required to provide a notarized statement from a Treasury approved surety  stating that the offeror has bonding capacity equal to or greater than the estimated construction cost range of this project.  Offerors will also be required to provide evidence that they are licensed as a  general contractor in the State of New York.

The Price Proposals shall be segregated from the Technical Proposals and placed in a separate envelope.  

The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions, but if a decision is made to conduct discussions with offerors, the Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range. (see FAR 15.306).

Each offeror's technical evaluation results from the pre solicitation step of this procurement will be carried forward into the RFP step of this procurement which will result in an offeror receiving a possible total point score of 1,000 (700 points from the pre solicitation step and 400 from the RFP step)

<SUBJECT>A--BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) FOR DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION OF AN ORDNANCE INITIATION SYSTEM USING NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO FLEET BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEMS
<SOLNBR>N0016404R4502
<RESPDATE>092704
<ARCHDATE>02282005
<CONTACT>Ellen McDaniel 8128545315
<DESC>The Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center has a requirement to develop and to demonstrate an ordnance initiation system using new and emerging technologies applicable to fleet ballistic missile systems.  The Navy intends to develop the technologies required by the ordnance system, build a laboratory prototype of the system and demonstrate feasibility of the system in a relevant environment. The ordnance system prototype will be scaled down in order to meet schedule and budgetary requirements, however should provide an effective demonstration of key technological requirements scalable to the total system.  The proposed alternative ordnance system solution should use new and emerging technology and should identify advantages over the current Trident D5 ordnance system in terms of cost, safety, reliability, performance and versatility. To meet programmatic goals in terms  of cost reduction, the most practical design approach may employ an architecture that minimizes or eliminates the need for a linear ordnance energy transfer system that accounts for over 90% of the Trident D5 system costs (excluding controller/firing unit costs).  System versatility goals could be met by designing a system that is adaptable to multiple ordnance initiation functions such as, stage separation, gas generator and rocket motor ignition (both large boost motors and smaller eject/jettison motors), and missile destruct.  The event being initiated may be located a significant distance from control electronics sending signals commanding the function.  The ordnance system should be capable of accurate timing in terms of simultaneity and minimum function time.  The most technically challenging requirement for this design will be to meet system safety.  Compliance to MIL-S TD-1512, MIL-STD1576, MIL-STD-1316E, MIL-STD-1901A, and EWR 127-1 are to be considered as system design goals. Explosives used shall not be more sensitive to impact than PentaErythritol TetraNitrate (PETN). In-line or out-of line systems may be proposed based upon the explosive materials that are proposed.    Safety characteristics should be addressed with emphasis on sensitivity to shock (high-acceleration survivability), temperature range, vibration and hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance.  Other performance parameters that should be considered are system weight, energy consumption and the ability to withstand a broad range of environmental conditions including temperature, shock, vibration and electro-magnetic radiation.  Evaluation Criteria:  Proposals will compete for award based upon their potential value to the government in fulfilling the requirements st ated above.  That value will be determined using a combination of criteria including technical merit, affordability, and the governments confidence in effective pursuit of the effort considering the scope of the effort, the offeror’s understanding of it, the competence and availability of experienced engineering, scientific, managerial, personnel, the offeror’s corporate experience and the availability of, or ability to obtain, necessary facilities to perform this effort.  Cost realism and reasonableness will also be considered to the extent appropriate.  The primary goal of this R&D effort is to successfully demonstrate feasibility of an alternative ordnance initiation system suitable for strategic missile applications.  The best solution will be the most practical solution that demonstrates safe and reliable operation, is cost effective, can be adapted to initiate a variet y of events spaced throughout a large missile, and that best meet the requirements. The prototype system should include new and/or emerging technology that has not been previously demonstrated in a strategic missile application/environment.  The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, none or any combination of the proposals received.  The Navy may or may not choose to use the technology demonstrated in a follow-on strategic propulsion applications program. At minimum, proposals should address requirements stated above and include the method of initiation, prospective energetic materials, proposed system architecture, system safety mechanisms, system reliability, system timing and costs estimates and breakdown.   The Government reserves the right to request an oral presentation in addition to the submitted proposals.  All proprietary or classified informatio n will be handled appropriately.  The Navy will evaluate proposals with technical advisory support provided by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC).  The planned completion date for this effort is 30 September 2007.  Estimated cost is $1,000,000 total and may be funded incrementally for a period up to 36 months.  The BAA package will be posted on the NSWC Crane web site at http://www.crane.navy.mil.    The POC for information regarding this procurement is Ms. Ellen McDaniel, telephone 812-854-5315, fax 812-854-5666 or email mcdaniel_e@crane.navy.mil.  It is anticipated that the BAA solicitation package will be released on or about 20 August 2004.  Numbered note 26 applies.

This contract will require the services of a certified safety professional.

The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.

Ability to perform the work to schedules and capability to complete up to 3 taskings simultaneously (show current and known projected workload through the contract duration including option years).  Firms will be evaluated in terms of impact of this workload on the design staff's projected workload during the contract period.

4.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.

5.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans and specifications - list key personnel responsible.

6.  Firm location (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).

7.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps has a requirement for procurement and delivery of Mobile Electric Power Distribution - Replacement (MEPDIS-R) sets to include Technical Manuals and initial training as follows: 5 kilowatt Power Panel for Indoor use (maximum quantity of 400); 5 kilowatt Power Panel for Outdoor use (maximum quantity of 400); 15 kilowatt Power Panel (maximum quantity of 300); 30 kilowatt Power Panel (maximum quantity of 250); 100 kilowatt Power Panel (maximum quantity of 100); 300 kilowatt Power Panel (maximum quantity of 50); 10 different cable assembly/set types (maximum quantity of 1750); CAM Lock Connectors Set (maximum quantity of 250); and 2 sizes of Cable Reels (maximum quantity of 1200).

This effort will be 100% Set Aside for Small Business and pursued as an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract in accordance with FAR Part 12. The MEPDIS-R program has been initiated to produce and deploy a commercial-based MEPDIS that will fulfill the performance objectives set forth in the specification. The MEPDIS is a replacement for the existing Mil-Standard MEPDIS, with a commercial based, tailorable system of power distribution panels and cables that can be rapidly procured in support of military operations.  Current systems, although meeting the need, are heavy, expensive and have a long lead-time procurement cycle. The USMC also intends to adopt commercial connectors for power lead interface, vice traditional military-style connectors.

The MEPDIS-R shall be capable of supplying 60Hz electrical power for varied power requirements when used with 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 100 kW standard military generator sets. Additionally, the system must be capable of distributing 120/208V power, Y-connected power. The future MEPDIS is envisioned to consist of lightweight, modular, distribution panels NEMA 3R (minimum), NEMA 4X (desired). The panels shall be in size configurations to handle 5, 15, 30 and 100 kW of electrical through-put, with the ability to be interconnected with lightweight, multi-conductor cables, with connectors sized by amperage, keyed for voltage, and capable of rapid connect/disconnect. Through adaptor cables, the system shall be capable of interconnecting with other Services' electrical power distribution systems, utilizing Military Standard Class-L electrical connectors, with a 3-phase, 5-wire (4-wire with equipment ground) capability.

All information relative to this procurement, to include the release of the Formal RFP document will be available to industry via FedBizOpps on or about November 26, 2004. Questions regarding this effort should be addressed to Gabrielle Trickett.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Such organizations may obtain a copy of the RFQ by downloading the attachment to this posting.  Additionally, an interested vendor form that perspective Contract Teaming Arrangement/consortia partners can fill out has been posted to both websites. This information will be provided to GSA Schedule holders via the e-Buy website to assist interested vendors in finding interested team members/consortia partners.  Firms may complete the form (1 page max) and submit via email to apsobangkok@usaid.gov.


GSA schedule holders may access the RFQ by logging onto GSA's E-Buy website which can be accessed at http://www.gsaadvantage.gov or http://www.ebuy.gsa.gov.     Please be advised that the only method of quote submission permitted is via the GSA E-Buy website.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below.

The above items can be made available upon written request and demonstrated  interest in this program.

1.	The following is provided for informational purposes:

Ø	Contractor’s Question:  MIL-STD-810 calls out a tailoring process to define the various specifications the CVBS will need to meet throughout its service life.  Please provide a list of these environmtal specifications.

Ø	Government Response:  The environment specifications shall be as stated in the synopsis solicitation, page 3, “Under both controlled and adverse weather conditions…for both afloat and ashore activities…”  Recommend the retionale for tailoring the test parameter specifications (temperature, humidity levels, etc.) be included in your concept study


Ø	 Contractor’s Question: Other than visual technology are other technologies required in CVBS?

Ø	Government Response:  Technologies, other than visual, are not required.  However, a selection criteria element on page 4 of the synopsis solicitation is proposing “innovations outside of the outlined goals.”


Ø	Contractor’s Question: Can you provide more information on how currently deployed equipment falls short in terms of training and reliability of fault detection?

Ø	Government Response: Formal data to identify any shortfalls in training and inspection reliability is not available.    


Ø	Contractor’s Question: Are there current capabilities that are desired to be field upgrades?

Ø	Government Response: The desirable performance upgrades shall be in the concept study.


Ø	Contractor’s Question: What is the purpose of “insertion tubes still in the engine warning systems”, and is there a desired implementation NAVAIR would prefer for this feature?

Ø	Government Response: An insertion tube warning system is desired so that the borescope is not damaged if the engine is turned while the borescope is still in place.  There is particular implementation feature preferred, however refer to the weight, size, cost and reliability considerations.	


Ø	Contractor’s Question: Does the US Navy desire support for specific I/O connectivity to adapt for “new technology in the commercial market? (such as PC Card, USB, etc…)?

Ø	Government Response: No specific I/O connectivity features are desired.  The proposal should identify the optimum requirements based on cost and reliability. 


2.  The proposal submission date for this requirement remains unchanged.

<DESC>This notice is a MARKET SURVEY. The US Army RDECOM-ARDEC is currently seeking qualified sources to undertake a material processing research and development (R&D) project in the area of innovative ceramic materials for armor applications. The materials to be evaluated are non-oxide eutectic ceramics. The US Army ARDEC is interested in new ideas in ceramic armor processing which utilize these eutectics to achieve micro-laminate microstructures in ceramics forms adaptable to armor applications. The utilization of new processing methodologies is to be encouraged.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate that non-oxide ceramic eutectic microstructures offer distinct advantages in the ceramic armor arena. As an initial performance requirement these non-oxide eutectics should possess the following properties: Density: < 4 g/cc; Porosity: 50 microns max.; Flexural strength: >380MPa; Elastic Modulus: >410 GPa; Hardness: >2400kg/mm2 for Knoop (300g).  Consideration will be given only to submissions that clearly enunciate the following capabilities: 1) an existing facility that has prepared non-oxide ceramic eutectic specimens for laboratory characterizations, 2) the ability to delineate processing features with respect to the material’s chemistry, crystallographic orientation and dimensions so that ceramic tiles made from this material show potentially enhanced ballistic performance comparable to presently employed monolithic ceramic materials, 3) a clear concise roadmap detailing the methodology to be employed to demonstrate producibility, quality assurance and affordability of this material as a candidate material for DOD armor applications.  All responses must include company name, address, point(s) of contact, phone and fax numbers, email address(es), business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE Code.  Additionally, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil/ccr/scripts/index.html  The Government anticipates a sole source award to General Atomics in San Diego, CA however all interested parties making a submission to this notice will be considered by the Government. Interested sources should provide the aforementioned information no later than January 7, 2005.  Information shall be submitted electronically to U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny, ATTN: Ms. Teresa Leap, Bldg. 9, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000 email address tleap@pica.army.mil  Responses shall be limited to ten (10) pages.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government will not reimburse the cost incurred for providing submissions to this Market Survey.  No basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this market survey or Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.  Notes 22 & 25 apply.

<DESC>Endangered Species Restoration Program/California State University - Stanislaus The Endangered Species Recovery Program (ESRP) is a cooperative research program on biodiversity conservation in central California, administered by California State University, Stanislaus.  The program was established in August 1992 at the request and with the support of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, under the direction of Dr. Dan Williams and subsequently Dr. Patrick Kelly (following Dr. Williams' retirement in Sept. 2002) at CSU Stanislaus. Over the past decade, ESRP has grown into a cooperative research program working with local, State, and Federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, corporations, and private land owners.  ESRP is composed of approximately 45 staff members, including biologists, student employees, support staff, several research associates, and numerous collaborators in government and universities worldwide whose combined expertise and contributions are integral to the recovery of threatened and endangered species in Central California. ESRP biologists are based in Fresno, Turlock, Bakersfield, and the Bay Area. ESRP is the only entity currently conducting extensive research on riparian brush rabbits; as well as actively applying management and recovery efforts, with the assistance of federal and state agencies.  The ESRP riparian brush rabbit recovery team consists of two senior scientists, three wildlife biologists, three project biologists, student interns and volunteers, and one maintenance technician.  Collectively, ESRP staff has over 30 years of experience with riparian brush rabbits and woodrats.

<SUBJECT>A -- Clinical Site Monitoring Project
<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to extend the current contract N01-AI-05405 with Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) for 18 months until December 31, 2006 under Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), Unique Capabilities.  The NIAID has undertaken a restructuring of the DAIDS funded networks and since the current monitoring contract scope of work is directly related to the structure of these networks and the potential for change is significant, an extension of the contract is required.  The present monitoring strategy was developed during the 1990’s when NIAID expended very few clinical trial resources internationally and when most of our network research dollars were devoted to therapeutic interventions.  In 2000, DAIDS funded both a Vaccine Trials network and a Prevention Trials network that expanded significantly into resource poor settings.  The scope of work of the 2000 monitoring contract included these new networks but used the “therapeutic” model for monitoring which included quarterly visits for main units and twice yearly visits for subunits.  This approach is less than perfect for Prevention sites that may participate in Maternal to Child transmission studies, Behavioral Intervention studies, and Microbicide studies all with different staff and in different locations within the same grant institution. The one-size fits all approach is no longer optimal.  As the sponsor of federally funded clinical trials research, DAIDS has an on-going regulatory responsibility for oversight of some 200 studies conducted at over 900 sites in 43 countries, and PPD has assumed a significant part of this responsibility through this contract.  PPD currently provides domestic and international on-site monitoring and training services for the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the Acute Infection Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), and two large non-network trials ESPRIT and SMART.  In responding to the scientific priorities of the evolving HIV/AIDS epidemic, larger and more complex studies have been implemented in the last several years that have necessitated shifts in how often and what we monitor.  The negotiated 18 month extension of this contract will allow NIAID to link the re-structuring of the HIV/AIDS clinical trials networks to the re-evaluation of our monitoring strategy while providing continuous oversight of our on-going studies.  PPD is uniquely qualified to continue to fulfill these requirements by virtue of their performance under the current contract.  If this portion of the PPD requirement were awarded to another contractor at this time, the consequences would mean an interruption and/or inconsistency in the normal monitoring operations of DAIDS.  Therefore, no other service will satisfy Agency requirements.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting their interest and a capability statement demonstrating their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of costs and effort.  See Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.
