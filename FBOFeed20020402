<DESC>NAICS Code: 339111   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with NyCom, Inc., 2436 Miami Boulevard, Durham, NC 27703. The construction contractor for EPA-RTP New Campus provided Fisher Hamilton laboratory case work/component products. As laboratories have been completed based on the initial design and upfit work, research scientists have identified additional products needed in order to house specific research instruments or meet the individual research needs. In order to meet these  needs, Fisher Hamilton products must be utilized. One of EPA-RTP's initial design mandates was that the laboratories be designed as modules which could be easily changed to meet future research needs. Laboratories are designed for quick, easy reconfiguration, reducing the need for new construction  and renovation as research priorities change. For example, the laboratories are designed such that there is a central raceway along the bench top through which all of the electrical, plumbing, etc., needs of the laboratory are provided and housed. Use of a single manufacture's products ensure that  all of the components are and can be used together/swapped out to meet changing needs. Mixing of various vendor casework products/components may introduce variations in height, width or depth from one component to the next which would be unacceptable and could create health and safety concerns when  dealing with chemicals or other hazardous materials or may impact the operation of sensitive scientific equipment located on the bench top. Laboboratory case work/component products must be acquired through Fisher Hamilton authorized network. This network is broken up into territories and each  territory is exclusively assigned to a single distributor, thereby preventing competition among distributors. NyCom, Inc., is the exclusive distributor of Fisher Hamilton products in North Carolina. The EPA has identified NyCom, Inc. the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The  circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements". All interested parties who believe they can provide the required supplies should fully explain their capabilities in  writing within 15 days of the date of this announcement. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine  letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should submit a written proposal within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990, which has a small business size standard of $5.0  million, is applicable.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for variable temperature liquid nitrogen detector cryostat (2 ea), temperature controller (2 ea), and high vacuum turbo pump station (1 ea). This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Cryo Industries of America, Inc. as the only known source who can meet the Agency's requirement. The proposed system will be used to test space flight active pixel sensors for the GIFTS Program. NASA currently has a cryostat system from Cryo Industries of America, Inc. The new equipment to be purchased must be compatible with this current system to reduce the risk of damage to the active pixel sensors. The system must also be compatible with current software from JPL which controls the temperature while testing. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to implement compatible products with existing Cryostat system, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 10, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

No other source has SEI's unique knowledge and expertise in the Thin-Pack technology for P-3 and E-2C and its application for the Air Force Versions 1 and 2.  The scope of this order includes 1) planning support, 2) design, 3) design verification, 4) production process verification, 5) fabrication of prototypes, 6) hardware interface, and 7) testing support for development of Air Force Version 2 of Thin-Pack.  Proposed order type: cost plus fixed fee/level of effort.  Anticipated Period of Performance: Eleven months from Award to completion.   FOB Destination.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation, which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Missile Defense Systems Division of The Boeing Company, 6633 Canoga Avenue, Canoga Park, CA 91309-7922 in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has designated USSOCOM to lead the program to conduct an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD) of an advanced tactical laser system.  The ACTD is intended to demonstrate the tactical utility of a laser system. The reason justifying the lack of competition is that the Department of Defense guidelines for ACTDs provide that  ?technologies proposed for incorporation into an ACTD should not be in the 6.1 (basic research) or 6.2 (applied research) budget categories.? Furthermore, the technologies must have been successfully demonstrated at the subsystem or component level and at the required performance level prior to the start of the ACTD. Therefore, any contractor participating in this ACTD must have a system that meets the tenets of the ACTD guidelines. Based on our knowledge of the market, Boeing is the only contractor with a laser system that meets the ACTD technology readiness levels. Boeing has designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a 20kW Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL) that eliminates the effluents by using a sealed exhaust system. The concept and 20kW prototype developed by Boeing is the only existing technology that is mature enough to be demonstrated under an ACTD.  Boeing has patents for the critical design features of the Sealed Exhaust type of COIL technology, which is the advancement that allows this type of laser to merit ACTD approval.  The 20kW system development is an important step in making it low-risk to scale up to a larger system.  An even lower power device preceded this 20kW design.  This second device validated the process for going to higher power as primarily a function of lengthening the active chamber.  As the developer only The Boeing Company has the expertise to perform the ATL ACTD. Award to any other source would not meet the ACTD technology readiness requirements. Given the level of technology readiness of other contractors, the Government would be required to spend significant (millions) dollars to fund basic laser research to get them to a technology readiness level comparable to Boeing. Award to a source other than Boeing would not allow USSOCOM to meet the criteria to execute an ACTD program and/or demonstrate the tactical utility of an advanced tactical laser. The government anticipates awarding from two to four separate contracts related to this announcement for a period of approximately five years with a potential maximum of up to $250,000,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency. Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Ms. Jacqueline (Jackie) Foreid-Germain, foreidj@socom.mil, fax (813)828-7504.  See Note #22.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Program Office, AAC/YU, obtained firm fixed priced options for Lots 1 and 2 and a Production Price Commitment Curve (PPCC) arrangement for multiple contract actions to award production Lots 3 through 11 of the JDAM weapon system with a previously estimated total acquisition quantity of 88,000 units.  To date the JDAM program office has awarded production buys through Lot 6.  The JDAM Program Office now estimates a revised total acquisition quantity of approximately 236,000 units spanning FY97 thru FY07 timeframe.  The existing Lot 6-11 PPCC arrangement will be leveraged off of to obtain the increased lot quantities/prices being planned during the existing PPCC timeframe.  Approximate period of performance for the revised total production quantity is expected to extend into FY 2009.  These actions are anticipated to be awarded on a sole source basis to the McDonnell Douglass Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of The Boeing Company (MDC/Boeing), as firm fixed-price efforts.  To perform this effort, a contractor must have a detailed knowledge of the JDAM weapon system design, including all of its sub-components and be familiar with the system modes of operations to meet performance specifications.  At this time, the Government does not own a technical data package (TDP) for the JDAM weapon system.  The TDP is owned by MDC/Boeing, of P.O. Box 516, St. Louis MO 63166-0516.  The program office issued an initial synopsis for JDAM on 05 Jun 95, which addressed the overall acquisition approach of down selecting to a single contractor for award of EMD Phase II, Low Rate Initial Production lots and receipt of the PPCC for future production lots.  This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  For contractual information concerning this synopsis, please contact the Contracting Officer, Ms. Bridget Tuominen, at (850) 882-3525, extension 3059.  For technical information, contact the Technical Director, Mr. James M. (Mike) Evans, at (850) 882-3525, extension 3203.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer or Technical Director identified above.  The Ombudsman is Dr. Mario J. Caluda, AAC/CD, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 123, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is (850) 882-5558.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>NA The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York requests for quotes (RFQ) to award a firm-fixed commercial contract for the effort consisting of furnishing the following:  a.  all labor, materials, fittings, equipment, tools, power, heat, water, etc., and perf orming all work on U.S.  Drift Collection Boat HAYWARD specified herein, the principal dimensions of which and physical data pertaining thereto, are as follows: GENERAL DESCRIPTION:   	Length Overall........................................ 124-0 in.     	Breadth, Molded..................................... 38'0 in.     	Depth, Molded........................................ 12-9 in.    	Material..................................................

P, 4 blade 	Draft, light .. 10     	Hull Form/Special Features..................Monohull/Keel coolers b.  The major workscope includes drydocking the vessel and cleaning and painting the hull, decks and fittings and miscellaneous modifications and repairs noted in accordance with these specifications.  c.  Wherever the term 'Plant' is used in these specifi cations, it is understood to refer to the items of floating plant named in this paragraph, together with their normal appurtenances, equipment, and supplies. d.  The contractor shall furnish the necessary facilities for and shall bear the expense of any movement of the plant while it is in his or her possession. e.  Should the removal, or shifting of any parts of the plant or its fittings, stores, fuel, water, etc., be necessary for the carrying out of the repairs specified, the same shall be done by the contractor at his/her own expense and all such removals shall be subsequently replaced and any damage or mess resulting therefore shall be made good by the cont ractor at his/her expense. f.  These specifications prescribe the requirements for the repair of the 'HAYWARD'.  The contractor's work shall comply with (US Coast Guard 'Rules and Regulations for Subchapter I, Vessels') as found in the Code of Federal Regu lations (Title 46, CFR) and American Bureau of  Shipping 'Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels'. PLEASE NOTE: Four hours towing time distance restriction - The specifications call for the Government to deliver the barge to the contractors yard. The towing vessel is restricted in its speed and in the duration and extent of its sea voyages because of the vessels design and by the standards to which it was equipped and outfitted.  Thus, delivery beyond a four (4) hour radius (40) miles of Caven Poi nt Terminal would be a costly and unsafe undertaking by the Government.  Large costs would be incurred for the towing vessel, crew overtime and transportation back to Caven Point.  Unnecessary jeopardy of the vessel would be occasioned by a long towing voy age into waters whose sea state could rapidly change for the worse with the barge still under tow.  Prior to the award of any contract under this solicitation the successful bidder will be required to enter into a 'Master Agreement for Repair and Alteratio n of Vessels'.  Bidders that entered into the agreement prior to this solicitation need not comply with this clause. Detailed information including price schedule, and plans and specifications for this effort shall be provided in its entirety on the USACE Website http://nan.usace.army.mil. This is a 100% total set-aside for small business. The applicable NAICS Code is 811310 with a small business size standard of $5 million. The contract duration is fifty (50) calendar days after delivery of vessel to contr actors yard.  All responsible offerors may submit one quote to be considered. The solicitation will be issued April 02, 2002 and quotes will be due within 15 days, COB local time on April 17, 2002. The media selected for the issuance of the synopsis/solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the Internet. Paper copies of this solicitation, and amendments, if any, will not be available or issued. In terested parties may download and print the solicitation, at no charge at http://nan.usace.army.mil (contracting opportunities). Project specification files and drawings are portable document files (PDF) and can be viewed, navigated, or printed using Adobe  Acrobat Reader.

A registration page is attached to the website and prospective bidders and subcontractors are required to register and to  receive notice of any amendments and /or addenda that may be issued to this solicitation. Those registering are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the mailing list. Registration must include the firm's physical address, telephone, a valid fax number and a point of contact Registration Requirements: DFARS 252.204-7004 Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR) applies to this procurement. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Department of Defense CCR Database prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ (NAWCADLKE) intends to enter into fully competitive negotiations with qualified sources of supply. The NAWCADLKE intends to procure four (4) Hydraulic Tripod Jacks, P/N 59J6185, to be used on the V-22 aircraft.  The Tripod Hydraulic Jack will be used to support the Nacelle during the removal and installation of the Nacelle-Pylon Links.  It will also be used to support the wing when major components are being removed from the opposite side.  The Hydraulic Tripod Jack is a portable self-contained, hydraulically operated tripod/tripod type jack.  The Hydraulic Tripod Jack consists of three (3) principle assemblies:  (1) a hydraulic lift unit incorporating a ram and extension screw; (2) a tubular steel tripod structure; and (3) a hydraulic pump unit, which is mounted on one leg of the tripod. The tripod structure is adjustable to various heights (by means of five (5) sets of leg extensions) ranging from a basic height of 52 inches to a maximum lift height of 197 inches.  The leg extensions are quickly attached and detached by bolts and nuts for changes in height.  The pump unit, which is connected to the lift by a flexible hose, is quickly removed from the tripod structure by a U-bolt clamp assembly.  A rise indicator attached to the lift unit indicates the distance the load has been lifted, and is helpful in keeping the load balanced when two (2) or more jacks are used to lift a single load.  Mobility, swivel castered foot assemblies are provided at the bottom of each leg assembly of the tripod structure to facilitate moving and positioning of the jack assembly.  Incorporated in the casters is a spring-loaded yoke and spindle to maintain the base of the foot assembly two (2) inches from the ground, until the load is applied to the jack structure.  The contractor shall supply all labor, equipment and consumable supplies to manufacture in its entirety.  The Government does not own data rights or technical drawings. The Government is anticipating a Firm Fixed Price type contract.  Inspection and acceptance shall occur at source.  All finished Hydraulic Tripod Jacks are to be shipped FOB destination by 02 May 2002.  In addition, the packing/packaging will be best commercial practice. Responses should reference N68335-02-Q-0149.  The point of contact is Judith Dastis at (732) 323-7339.  E-Mail:  dastisja@navair.navy.mil.  All contractors seeking award must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Contracts cannot be awarded to contractors unless they are registered.  For CCR information contact the CCR Registration Assistance Center (RAC), at:  888-227-2423, or contact the CCR Program Office by e-mail at:  contact.ccr@us.pwcglobal.com

<DESC>The objective of the research sought by this ROA is to increase nuclear explosion monitoring effectiveness through improved understanding of basic earthquake and explosion phenomenology.  Research of a fundamental nature is sought to answer the question of how the seismic energy is generated from these phenomena (including distributed and single point explosions, double-couple earthquakes and other modes of rock failure) and how this energy is partitioned between P and S waves.  Specifically, How is the generation and partitioning of the seismic energy affected by properties such as 1) source region medium and overburden, 2) the local structure, and 3) the surrounding tectonic province; What are the significant measurable effects of the partitioning of the seismic energy into various regional P and S phases, especially at high frequency; What is the physical basis for a measurable property, such as magnitude that can be directly related to the yield of a fully coupled explosion, and how do emplacement conditions effect the observation?

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Grantee: Umicore Med JSC (former Union Miniere Pirdop Copper JSC): Date: Apr. 1/02:  Contact Person: Mr. Demis Panayotidis:  Address:2071 Pirdop, Bulgaria
Phone:+359 728 48 2276:  Fax:+359 2 980 64 90  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Waste Management Project at the Umicore Med plant in Pirdop, Bulgaria.
In 1997, Union Miniere, presently named Umicore, bought the MDK copper production factory located in Pirdop, Bulgaria. In addition to an ongoing Environmental Remediation Program, addressing Historical damages, and an ongoing Environmental Compliance Program, part of an Investment Program addressing compliance with Bulgarian legislation, Umicore Med is now implementing a Waste Management Program to address the management and optimum recycling of wastes produced during the present operational activities of the factory.
The U.S. firms selected will 
1.	Assess and develop the feasibility of a strategy which Umicore Med could develop to reduce waste generation in terms of volume and harmfulness, and;
2.	Develop the feasibility of recycling two main waste streams coming from the factory, Fayalite and Gypsum, in order to limit waste storage in landfill and optimise recycling.
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $141,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal and the Terms of Reference are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.
Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  
Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 16:00 local time (GMT + 2 hrs), May 13, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Virginia Contracting Activity, on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency/ Missile and Space Intelligence Center (DIA/MSIC), Building 4545, Fowler Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5500 intends to procure two APCOM 5016 MPC-1 Multi-Purpose Chasses, two PS-1 Power Supplies, four Model 5016 IDA-IX4 Instrumentation Distribution Amplifiers, ten 5016 1X6 (WB) Video Distribution Amplifiers, and eighteen Model 5016 BP-1 Blank Panels.  The requested hardware is required as a component of an Intelligence Community standard ELINT analysis laboratory configuration called the Digital ELINT Laboratory (DEL).  It is much more cost effective for MSIC to implement this standard DEL configuration rather than incur the additional expenses required to design and develop an alternative system.  Also, MSIC's equipment must be compatible with existing hardware in the MSIC Signals Analysis Laboratory.  Therefore, for maintenance and interoperability reasons, the requested units must be the same models as those APCOM distribution amplifiers already being used in the MSIC signal analysis laboratory.  The specifications of  the distribution amplifiers required by the MSIC Signals Analysis Laboratory are as follows:  

Video Distribution Amplifier Specifications:
Number of Inputs per Amplifier:  One
Type of Input Connector:  BNC
Number of Outputs per Amplifier:  Six
Type of Output Connectors:  BNC
Frequency Response:  DC to 40 MHz + or - 1.5 dB
Nominal Input Level:  1 Vrms
Signal Port Impedance:  50 Ohms
Signal Port Return Loss:  DC to 40MHz > 10 dB
Output-to-Output Isolation:  DC to 40 MHz > 30 dB
Linearity:  + 0.5% best straight line 
Crosstalk:  DC to 40MHz > 60 dB
Output Signal Level:  1Vrms
Signal Indicators:  Over Voltage and Signal Present

Instrumentation Distribution Amplifier Specifications:
Number of Inputs per Amplifier:  One
Type of Input Connector:  BNC
Number of Outputs per Amplifier:  Four
Type of Output Connectors:  BNC
Frequency Response:  DC to 100 kHz + or - 1.0 dB
Input Signal Level:  8 Vpp
Signal Port Impedance:  600 Ohms
Output-to-Output Isolation:  > 30 dB for DC to 40 MHz
Crosstalk Isolation:  > 70 dB
Output Signal Level:  8 Vpp Ohm Nominal
Signal Indicators:  Over Voltage

Please notice that the specifications are based on the specifications of the APCOM equipment.  All offerors must meet or exceed these specifications in order to be considered.  The period of performance shall be completed by June 1, 2002.  No solicitations shall be issued other than this notice. All offerors interested in submitting an offer must fax their quotations to MSIC, Donna Tignor, FAX 256-313-7963  NLT April 10, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC>Synopsis for Fed Bix Opps
 Molecular Force Probe

In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to acquire a molecular force probe instrument for the manipulation of single molecules from Asylum Research, 601 C Pine Street, Santa Barbara, CA  93117.  The instrument must accommodate simultaneous force and fluorescence imaging measurements.  The instrument is necessary for the development of a nanofluidic measurement platform.  Single molecule force measurements require the most advanced force measurement instrumentation available to date at the 1 piconewton level to quantify mechanochemical phenomena that govern the structure and function of DNA and proteins.  The instrument should therefore, reflect the latest innovations and state-of-the-art currently available from manufacturers of microcantilever based force measurement systems.  The following are the Government's minimum technical specifications. General Requirements - 1) The molecular force probe must allow for top and bottom optical access to fluid cells with optical ports for illumination for fluorescence, bright field, dark field, phase contrast or transparent samples as well as optical access for the objectives of the stereomicroscope;  2) space around the fluid cell necessary for introducing and removing fluids to and from the cell; and 3) a mounting stage for course positioning of the molecular puller relative to the optics of a stereomicroscope.  System Components - 1) Molecular-force probe head for mounting cantilevers.  The head should allow for automated means of measuring forces on a molecule attached to the cantilever by measuring the deflection of the cantilever.  The head should be able to measure both deflection and torsion of the cantilever in DC and AC modes.  2) 100 micrometer lateral scan-range and a 16-micrometer vertical scan range piezo scanning stage for moving the tip relative to the sample.  3) Phase locked detection of cantilever motion (with force feedback).  4) Base plate adapting to inverted stage fluorescence microscope with sub micrometer positioning capability.  5) Control electronics. 6) Workstation for programming control electronics and 7) Software for molecular force measurements.   Performance Criteria - 1) be capable of detecting forces as small as 2 piconewtons corresponding to a cantilever noise of less than 0.2 ? RMS, 100 mHz to 10 kHz measurement bandwidth; 2) have less than 0.2 nm RMS, 100 mHz to 1 kHz measurement bandwidth, z-axis control with long term drift stability; 3) provide independent sensored closed loop control of x, y, and z positioning of the cantilever (z sensor noise less than 0.25 nm in a 1 kHz measurement bandwidth and z sensor non-linearity less than 0.2%  at full scan); 4)  accommodate fluid cell platforms up to 85 mm in diameter and 10 mm high;  5) provide viewing access from the top and bottom;  6)  use an infrared laser or other means to measure cantilever motion so as not to interfere with optical microscopy fluorescence measurements; 7) must be fully computer automated - all aspects of the data acquisition and control language and programs must be open to the user for modifications; 8)  use IGOR as the control language to insure compatibility with other instruments being used in other laboratories involved in the NIST SM3 Competence Program; 9)  be compatible with WINDOWS 2000 or later to facilitate the use of existing programs in NIST laboratories; 10)   provide full 16 bit digital control of force measurements at sampling rates exceeding 1 MHz; and 11)  provide internal means of calibrating the absolute spring constant of the cantilevers.  This acquisition is for a commercial item.  Interested concerns must submit a written qualification statement that clearly establishes the firm's capability to meet the above requirements.  This qualification statement shall be submitted to the individual and office cited above within 15 days from the date this synopsis is posted on the internet.  This is not a formal solicitation.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), National Capital Region (NCR), Washington D.C. announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture. The GSA is seeking Architectural-Engineering (A/E) Services for the Concept (35%) Design of a full renovation of the GSA Regional Office Building (ROB) to a modern office building in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. The GSA Regional Office Building is located at the intersection of 7th and D Streets, SW, Wash., DC.  Constructed as a warehouse between 1930 and 1935, it was converted to office use in the 1950s.  Built out of reinforced concrete, the structure occupies a full city block with seven floors and a basement.  It currently houses 2,352 employees and has approximately 77,377 gross square meters, including 88 inside parking spaces and 77 outside parking spaces. The project is not a historic renovation, however, the murals located on the walls of the 7th Street Lobby are considered historically significant.  The complete renovation is scheduled to commence in December 2004.  Estimated Construction Cost range is between $100 million and $110 million.  The facility will be designed in metric units.  The concept (35%) design will include, but may not be limited to, office space, storage, health facility, food service, conference and training facilities, light industrial, fiber optic cable network distribution to desktops, state-of-the-art data and telephone communication systems, flexible/reconfigurable spaces, dedicated computer circuits and stabilized power with distribution units, uninterruptible power system with standby generators, switchgear, all new underground utilities (electrical, water, sewage), building automation systems, and the standard architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, fire/life safety, plumbing, HVAC, electrical, vertical transportation, and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  The GSA is anticipating using a Bridging Method, where the concept (35%) design service is completed by an A/E under this solicitation, and then the Design/Build services are completed under a separate RFP solicitation.  The A/E services required under this solicitation will include a Program Development Study, Site Studies, Pre-Design, Design (up to concepts, 35%), and construction related oversight services during the Design/Build phase of the project.

<DESC>This is modification 3 to 9-BJ2-Z57-02-11P.  This modification addresses questions received regarding the Synopsis for the Information Systems Directorate Operations and Support Services Contract (IOSS) posted on March 5, 2002.   Question 1:	Will there be a transition period to allow move in, hiring of new employees, becoming accustomed to JSC standards and regulations, site orientation, etc.? Answer 1:	Yes. See Answer 2 for details. Question 2:	Since there are multiple contracts to be consolidated, with varying completion dates (and options) will the IOSS phase-in be staggered or completed all at once?  If staggered, what is the probable sequence and timeframe post award? Answer 2: Yes, this contract will use a staggered approach.  The anticipated start date for transitioning work currently performed under NAS9-98143 Data Systems Support Services Contract will begin December 1, 2002, with full operation status beginning January 1, 2003.  The anticipated transition start date for work currently performed under NAS9-01122 Application Development Support Contract will begin January 25, 2003, with full operation status beginning February 25, 2003.  The anticipated transition start date for work currently performed under NAS9-97135 Information Technology Support Services Contract will begin March 5, 2003 with full operation status beginning April 5, 2003.  The anticipated transition start date for work currently performed under NAS9-97001 Information, Imagery, Media, and Public Affairs Support Services Contract will begin March 1, 2004, with full operation status beginning May 1, 2004. Question 3:	Will there be an oral presentation as part of the bid response? Answer 3:  	Because a written proposal will be requested, there are no oral presentations required at this time. Question 4:	Is NASA aware of the Very Small Business Set-Aside Program (VSB) by the Small Business Administration?  Can pieces of this procurement be set-aside using the VSB Program? Answer 4:  	This procurement has been designated as a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  There will be no other set asides associated with this procurement. Question 5:	Do you plan to make this a multiple award contract or will there be a single award? Answer 5:	This will be made as a single award. Question 6:	Can you fax us bid paperwork?   Answer 6:	All information and proposal paperwork associated with this procurement will be posted to this website.   Question 7:	Is there a more detailed SOW? Answer 7:	A final SOW will be posted on the NAIS Page.  Details will be provided in sample task orders.  Please watch the NAIS Home Page for further developments.   Question 8:	In order to perform at least 50% of the work, we intend to team (in a prime-subcontractor relationship) with another business who also meets the size limit as a small business under the IOSS solicitation.  It is my understanding that if we together perform at least 50% of the work under the contract we will have met the small business requirement.  Is this correct? Answer 8:	No, this is not correct.  At least 51% of the work must be performed by the prime contractor. Question 9:	Where is the place of performance? Answer 9:	The place of performance will be at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. Question 10:	Is this a nationwide NASA procurement? Answer 10:	Not sure we understand your question, but the place of performance will be at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.  The competition is open to any small business in the U.S.A. Question 11:	Is there a set date and time yet for the contractor onsite briefing at Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX? Answer 11:	JSC has a tentative schedule for the briefing to take place on or about April 29, 2002 at JSC. Question 12:	What is the anticipated contract award date and about when would the new contractor start? Answer 12:	The anticipated contract award date is mid to late November 2002 with a contract start date of December 1, 2002. Question 13:	Will the 4 prior companies still be involved or is this being offered to a new company to take over all four of the existing contracts? Answer 13:	This procurement is a consolidation of 4 contracts.  One company will be awarded the new contract.   Question 14:	Will being a local company rooted in Houston and using Houstonians as employees have any bearing on award?  Answer 14:	Being from the Houston area will have no bearing on the award of this contract. Question 15:	The awarded company will use JSC on-site facilities, however, can offsite facilities or a combination of both be used for some of the multimedia work? Answer 15:	Such a decision should be made by the proposing contractor and will be evaluated by JSC. Question 16:	Is all the equipment such as computers, software, cameras, film processing equipment, printers, etc. supplied? Answer 16:	The Request for Proposal will state any specifically named equipment that will be supplied. Question 17:	How many buildings would we be required to manage? Answer 17:	There are an estimated eight buildings at JSC.   Question 18:	Do you need any other form of communication from us before our submission of a proposal after the release of the RFP (i.e. Statement of Qualifications)? Answer 18:	No other form of communication is needed unless the offeror or JSC has any questions. Question 19:	What kind of financial arrangements will be made with the awarded company regarding upfront start-up and step-up costs (i.e. contract advance, grants, etc.)? Answer 19:	There are no special financial arrangements planned with this contract.  Payments can be made every two weeks.  The Government plans no special financial arrangements for upfront costs; offerors must make their own arrangements.   Question 20:	What are the key positions and the names of the key personnel in each of the contracts today, beside program manager or project manager? Answer 20:	JSC cannot release the names of the current contract personnel. Question 21:	Will NASA provide a list of the labor categories on the existing contracts? Answer 21:	A list of existing labor categories will be included in the Draft RFP. Question 22:	Will NASA please provide the quantity of people in the labor categories on the existing contracts? Answer 22:	This information is not available at this time. Question 23:	What are the workload metrics for each requirement? Answer 23:	The workload metrics will be provided within the release of the RFP. Question 24:  Regarding Performance Work Statement 3.2.1.6.4 Building 46, the requirement refers to a list of items to be maintained by the Contractor, "as specified in these agreements, shall be maintained on behalf of ISD."  Does the Government anticipate making copies of these agreements available for review? Answer 24:   We will provide a list in the final release of the Request for Proposal. Question 25: 	Regarding Performance Work Statement (PWS) 3.2.1.2.3.2 Maintenance Agreements and License Renewals; PWS 3.2.1.4; and Table 3.2.1.2.3, the requirement is to provide maintenance support for 250 software products per month, 1400 hardware items per month, and 250 renewals.  Does the Government hold the maintenance agreements for the hardware and software maintenance required, or do the contractors?  Does the Government plan to novate these agreements and licenses to the contractor, or should the contractor plan to arrange for its own provision of hardware and software maintenance support services with the OEM's and other 3rd parties?  If so, how soon could the Government provide a list of all hardware and software to be maintained? Answer 25:  	These questions will be addressed in the final release of the Request for Proposal. Question 26:  Regarding Performance Work Statement (PWS) 3.3.8 Mail Services, the requirement states that "Security clearances shall be required for some work in this area.  Would the Government please provide clarification on the level/type of security clearance that is required, and for what approximate number of personnel this requirement applies?  (e.g., Sensitive, Secret, Tope Secret, etc.) Answer 26:  	No security clearances shall apply to the 3.3.8 Mail Services. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.  Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments.

<DESC>Amendment No. A002 to EMV-2002-RQ-0011 is issued to provide answers to questions asked by prospective sources and to extend the date for responses to this RFQ.

Question:  Please clarify that the Government is needing a KU only capable antenna.

Answer:  Yes, KU only.

Question:  Does the Government really desire two each waveguide kits?

Answer:  Yes, the Government wants two kits.  The Government has an existing KU band dish that we want to outfit with quick disconnects.

Question:  Vertex manufactures two type of waveguid kit.  One to provide for waveguide hook of the feed TX port down to a boom mounted RFT, the second extends the waveguide run to the edge of the reflector and then includes a section of twist-flex W/G to extend this to an equipment case on the ground.  Which waveguide kit do you need?  In either case, is the second kit a spare for the first, or do you want to extend the RX port beyond the feed - if so, where to?

Answer:  The Government desires the second waveguide kit described above which extends the waveguide run to the end of the reflector and then includes a section of twist flex W/G to extend to an equipment case on the ground.  

Question:  What is the nominal length of the 2 each waveguide kits required or are you looking to procure only the quick-release flanges to mate with the 2.4m Flyaway and your existing WR75 waveguide?

Answer:  The information provided in the question/answer preceding this question/answer should answer this particular question.  

Question:  Is the quick disconnect waveguide for a boom mounted HPA or should it go to the end of the feed boom for a rack mounted (in a case) HPA?  

Answer:  It should got the end of the feed boom for a rack mounted HPA.

The date and time for receipt of responses to this solicitation is extended to March 15, 2002 (Friday) at 10:00 AM EST.

EnRICH: Enhanced and Rapid Improvement of Community Health in Mindanao


I. Introduction:

The purpose of this Cooperative Agreement is to fund viable family planning and health related activities, which will help the ARMM and the local governments directly or indirectly to improve their health status in a sustainable way.

II. Background:

The Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was created by law in August 1989. Actual turn ?over of governance took place on November 1990. Composing the region are the four provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi; and the cities of Marawi and Isabela. 

The region has a population of about 2 million. Its four component provinces are among the most depressed in the Philippines with a 51%-54% poverty incidence, according to 1991data from NEDA. About 56% of the population are in the 15-64 years age bracket with an almost equal male to female ratio.

The following health indicators show that the region is one of the lowest 
performers in the nation.



Over the past years, USAID has been providing assistance to the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) through its programs administered under the Office of Population, Health and Nutrition (OPHN).
 
The major USAID/OPHN activities include:
&#61623; Quality Assurance Program/ MGP
&#61623; Sentrong Sigla (Center of Wellness Certification)
&#61623; AIDS Surveillance and Education
&#61623; Control of Infectious Diseases
&#61623; Nutrition (Vitamin A and Food Fortification)
&#61623; Child Survival Programs.
&#61623; Policy and IEC activities
&#61623; Support to Well Family Midwife Clinics

This year, a new project entitled ?EnRICH - Mindanao? will be initiated. USAID believes that it will supplement its other on-going health programs to help achieve Mission Objectives in ARMM.

The health system in the region continues to perform poorly. A number of factors contribute to this. Delivery of health services is affected by armed conflict between Muslim separatists and the military. Displacement of civilian population occurs in some areas. Kidnappings by the Abu Sayyaf ? a known terrorist group, still have not been resolved. During the previous regional government, development funds from the National Government intended for health were not efficiently utilized. The devolution of health services to the local governments has led to poor implementation of health programs and services. And, funding for the health sector in the local municipal budget often receives a low priority among a number of Local Governments.

There is also a general climate of uncertainty and instability in the region, which has slowed down development initiatives in the other sectors, like tourism, further inhibiting improvements in Family Planning, health and other services.

III. Rationale and Objective

Because this region regularly reports the lowest health and family planning statistics, USAID believes targeted, locality specific interventions are needed to improve the situation. 

The objective of this project is to fund viable family planning & health related projects, which will help the region and the local governments directly or indirectly improve their health status in a sustainable way. Under this project, USAID will provide assistance in the form of grants to fund activities aimed to increase contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) and to generally improve maternal and child health. Specifically, the ?ENRICH Grants? aims to:

&#61623; Increase Modern Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) of ARMM, from the lowest figures, to near National levels.
&#61623; Reduce high risk pregnancies
&#61623; Increase Vitamin A supplementation.
&#61623; Improve Tuberculosis Diagnosis and Treatment
&#61623; Improve other maternal & child health indicators

USAID ? accredited Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) with common health objectives will spearhead the implementation of the projects. 

Activities may include but are not limited to:

&#61623; Community organizing and social mobilization
&#61623; Capability building activities to increase the Local Government Unit?s or the private sector?s capacity to deliver health services.
&#61623; Upgrading, rehabilitation of Primary Health Facilities 
&#61623; Training of health service providers
&#61623; Development and implementation of behavior change campaigns.
&#61623; Installation of information systems.
&#61623; Other innovative FP activities.

The Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao has special difficulties that require a unique approach. With the cooperation and support of the new Regional ARMM government, the local governments, Department of Health and the private sector, knowledge, use and access to Family Planning modern methods and Maternal and Child Health services, will be improved, contributing to the over all development in Mindanao.

In a table format, proposed consultants (both long-term and short-term), should be listed accordingly and by appropriate skills area across the top.?

QUESTIONS  AND ANSWERS

Q.1.  Reference Page 17, Section E.3.  The last line reads, "Details of the performance monitoring and evaluation plan are described in Section C."  Monitoring plans are mentioned in the SOWs for three personnel on pages 13 and 14.  Otherwise, we are unable to locate the description of a performance monitoring and evaluation plan (PMEP) in Section C.
A.1.  Details of the PMEP should be consistent with the requirements in Section C of the RFP which describes the tasks and services to be provided, the expected outputs, etc.  Also, please refer to Section M, Evaluation Criteria where the Performance Monitoring Plan is a scored factor.

 Q.2.: Page 10, Section C. Part IV. of the solicitation includes a part B. and a part D. but no part C.  Is this an error in numbering/lettering, or is a section missing?
A.2.  Please see ?Changes to the RFP?, number 1 above.

Q.3. Page 46 of the solicitation --under section L.7 part 2 (iii)--mentions appropriate skills areas for long- and short-term consultants.  It reads, "skills areas should include at the minimum health insurance, managed care, health policy, health economics, social security, MIS, privatization, decentralization."  This contrasts with the list of skills outlined on page 15, Section C, Part IV.F: " family planning communication, public relations, advocacy, population education, medical and public health education--and related fields."  Please confirm the skills to be listed in the matrix.
A.3.  Please see ?Changes to the RFP?, number 6, above.

Q.4. Page 50 of the solicitation, Section M.2. Evaluation Criteria mentions both a draft Implementation Plan (1b.) and a draft workplan (1c).  Please clarify the difference between these two requirements. 
A.4.  The ?draft implementation plan? refers to the implementation plan for the life of the project  while the ?draft workplan? refers to the first year workplan, assuming August 2002 to July 2003, as indicated. 

 Q.5. Reference solicitation Section H.6. Personnel Compensation: We would request that this section simply reference AIDAR 752.7007 establishing compensation criteria as that practiced by the Contractor (or Subcontractor) subject to the ES-6 ceiling.  
A.5.  Please refer to ?Changes to the RFP? number 2.a, above.

Q.6.  Is there a limitation on the length of the proposals received?
A.6.  There is no page limitation for the proposals.

Q.7. The RFP outlines and supports the need for effective communication programs to strengthen social acceptance of family planning in the Philippines.  Will USAID support the use of funds for both television and radio airtime?
A.7. Depending on the proposed strategy of the offeror, funds may be allocated for both TV and radio airtime, for as long as this would not exceed 25% of the proposed total estimated cost of the project.

Q.8.  In  Section C.IV.D (Team Composition, Responsibilities and Qualifications of Long-term Positions) specifies that the desired qualifications for the Deputy Chief of Party/Technical Coordinator (DCOP/TC) candidate should include both a bachelor?s degree and masters degree.  Could the offeror recommend a candidate for the DCOP/TC position who will have completed his/her masters by August 2002?
A.8.  Yes.

Q.9.  Upon comparison of RFP 7 to this RFP, offeror notes that a PhD is preferred for two key personnel positions (including Chief of Party and Deputy Chief of Party/Technical Coordinator) in this RFP but not in RFP 7.  Please clarify the rationale for the preference for a PhD for these 2 candidates for this RFP.
A.9.  Please note that on all instances, RFPs are separate and distinct from other RFPs in terms of objectives and  requirements.  Please be guided accordingly.

Q.10.  A US National is preferred for this RFP, whereas a US or Filipino national is desired for RFP 7. Please clarify the preference for a US national for this RFP.
A.10.  Please see A.9 above.

Q.11. Section C.IV.E (Team Composition, Responsibilities and Qualifications of long-term Positions) specifies that USAID prefers the Chief of Party candidate have a PhD.  Would additional years of relevant experience substitute for a portion f the preference for the Ph.D. requirement?  Please clarify if additional relevant experience could also substitute for a portion of the preference for the Ph.D. requirement for the DCOP/TC.
A.11.  Yes, additional relevant experience may be considered.

Q.12 Section H.4 (nonexpendable Property purchases and information technology resources) on page 24 states that ?The contractor is hereby authorized to purchase the following equipment and/or resources? yet makes no specific reference to equipment items. Is the offeror expected to propose specific equipment items in their proposal?
A.12.  Yes, as deemed appropriate for the implementation of the project and subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

Q.13. Under Section M.2, Evaluation Criteria, letter D, on page 50, item number 2, letter c states that the offeror should ?propose a customer service plan for ensuring customer satisfaction.? Please clarify who the customer is for this plan and how this plan will be used.
A.13.  Please refer to Section C, Scope of Work. 

Q.14.  Under Section M.2, Evaluation Criteria, letter D, on page 50, item number 3, letter e states that the offeror shall ?discuss the support capabilities of the home office, including experience in commodity procurement and training?.  Please clarify what type of commodity procurement is to be part of this RFP. 
A.14.  Please refer to A.12 above.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought.  This sources sought replaces the pre-solicitation that was issued under Solicitation No. DTCG40-02-R-50019.  The Coast Guard is seeking qualified sources that can provide a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).  The Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center has a requirement to procure SCBA, hands on training, training video, operation manual, illustrated parts list and preventative maintenance manual.  The Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center intends to award a firm fixed price requirements type contract, with a base year and four option years.  The SCBA operational characteristics shall be as specified by the OSHA in 42 CFR Part 84, Subpart H and as specified by NFPA in NFPA 1981, Edition 1997.  This shall be demonstrated by the Manufacturer through certification of the SCBA by NIOSH and by NFPA.  The SCBA shall have a minimum rated service time of forty-five minutes when tested by NIOSH in accordance with 42 CFR Part 84, Subpart H.  The SCBA shall consist of a high-pressure 4500psi air cylinder in a backpack-type harness assembly, air pressure regulators, and a facemask an associated air hoses.  This procurement will be handled as a sole source with Mine Safety Appliance, Assemble To Order Number ATO No. G-CM104101C111 (medium mask) with the amplifier kit and transfill hose and Kevlar pouch attached and delivered as one complete unit. TransFill Hose and Kevlar Pouch Part No. 485366; Amplifier kit, complete with microphone Part No.10024074.  Note:  The amplifier kit shall be installed onto the facepiece during assembly and the Transfill hose and Kevlar pouch shall be attached to the right side of the waist belt. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Mine Safety Appliance parts are not available to the Government and are proprietary to the OEM.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center from obtaining competition as it?s available from one source only.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the SCBA for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities as follows: (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that you have satisfactorily manufactured a SCBA or have supplied the equipment to the OEM specified; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered SCBA to the OEM?s to demonstrate the acceptability of the SCBA.  It is the Government?s belief that only Mine Safety Appliance and/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required SCBA to ensure proper form, fit and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the SCBA are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within fifteen days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to the notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to Sharon Jackson, Contract Specialist (CODE 045/54). All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Coast Guard.  The solicitation will be available by electronic posting which the contractor will be responsible for uploading the solicitation and all amendments.

<DESC>NA SYNOPSIS FOR A SOURCES SOUGHT PRESOLICITATION CONFERENCE/MARKET SURVEY TO BE HELD 22 APRIL 2002 -- THE KANSAS CITY DISTRICT CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS REQUESTING COMMENTS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION COMMUNITY FOR THE PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION OF 84 FAMILY HOUSING UNITS A T FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS. 1. SOURCES SOUGHT TO ENCOURAGE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE ACQUISITION STRATEGY.  The Kansas City District Corps of Engineers wants to encourage maximum participation by local contractors in the upcoming Request For Proposals (RFP) for construction of 42 duplexes (total 84 Family Housing Units) at Ft. Leavenworth, Ks. The C.O.E. plans t o issue a BEST VALUE DESIGN-BUILD RFP about the end of May of 2002. The C.O.E. wants to hear from firms, large and small, interested in Prime Contractor or Subcontractor opportunities for this upcoming solicitation. A pre-solicitation/marketing conference will be held at Ft. Leavenworth, Ks in the Frontier Conference Center (Bldg 318) on 22 April 2002, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.  The purpose of the conference is for the Government to discuss project requirements and to gather comments from the construction community about the constructibility of this project that would increase participation in the Design- Build solicitation proces s. We strongly encourage constructive comments in this open forum discussion. Typical areas and items that could be discussed are. - Do you normally bid Government Work? If not, why not?  - What about the solicitation process would prevent you from bidding? - Are you concerned about compliance with Government regulations? - Do you have questions or concerns about the inspection and acceptance of construction? - Do you understand the Design-Build process and the BEST VALUE RFP selection process? - Are the Bid Documents confusing? If so, what is confusing about them? - What could the Government do to make you interested in bidding? - What types of systems, materials and construction methods should be allowed? - What Government requirements increase your cost/price to the Government? - In your opinion, is the estimated competitive price range reasonable? - Is the estimated construction period reasonable? No plan or proposal is requested of the participants; we are only soliciting your comments. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  A DRAFT of the solicitation documents and construction drawings will be made available on the Corps of Engineers contract web site (below) for interested parties to download and review. http://nwk-ebs.nwk.usace.army.mil/ebs/advertisedsolicitations.asp 2.
