This notice is NOT a Solicitation----what you are now reading is merely a Synopsis (also known as a Pre-Solicitation Notice).  (A Solicitation for this project will be published HEREAFTER, in this same FedBizOpps website.)  There is NO INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR.   At the level of the PRIME offeror (prime contractor), competition under this procurement is LIMITED to colleges, universities, and non-profit organizations. To repeat:  Each PRIME offeror MUST be a college, a university, or a non-profit organization.   However, a prime offeror may propose to use one or more commercial (i.e., profit-oriented) organizations as SUBcontractors, provided that each proposed commercial sub meets the small business size-standard associated with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990.  A prime offeror may also propose to use, as subcontractors, one or more colleges, universities or non-profit organizations; and any such proposed NON-commercial subs need NOT meet any size-standard.  The information set forth in this Synopsis is ALL of the information that DOT plans to release concerning this procurement, until DOT hereafter publishes this procurements Solicitation in FedBizOpps.  Therefore, please HOLD YOUR QUESTIONS until after you have carefully studied the forthcoming Solicitation.  The due date shown above is only an ESTIMATED due date for DOTs receipt of proposals.  The ACTUAL due date for proposals will be specified in the SOLICITATION hereafter published in this FedBizOpps website.

The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) hopes to award ONE and ONLY one Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contract from this procurement.   It is anticipated that the contract will have one Base Year and four Option Years.  Under the resulting IDIQ contract, any particular Task Order might be fixed-price, or cost-plus-fixed-fee, or labor-hour, or time-and-materialsor might have some other reimbursement structure.  

Only $500,000 of grand total Federal funding is budgeted for this entire project, and it is therefore anticipated that each offerors proposal will:  (a) show a grand total proposed Federal price of exactly $500,000, as counted across all five potential years of this project; and (b) include complete SUPPORT for every pricing RATE (including every pricing rate applicable to the PRIME offeror, and including every SUBcontractor pricing rate, and including every hourly CONSULTING rate) that the offeror used in compiling its cost proposal; and (c) offer the highest level of quality and the greatest amount of value, to DOT and to the taxpayers, that can possibly be provided by that offeror for the offerors total proposed Federal price of $500,000.  A DRAFT----not necessarily final----Statement of Work for this project immediately follows and is enclosed in five opening asterisks and five closing asterisks; and, after that draft Statement of Work, some DRAFT information concerning this projects estimated staffing is also given in this Synopsis. 

*****[This is the BEGINNING of this projects DRAFT Statement of Work.]  Objective: To establish a Transportation Economics Center (TEC) that will mobilize the analytic capabilities of the transportation economics community to assist the Office of Transportation Policy (OTP) in addressing important transportation policy issues, including through the conduct of research that applies economics to transportation policy issues, through organizing training and symposia to promote the use of economics in addressing transportation policy issues, and through other methods as appropriate. The Center will have an administrative structure that will ensure its ability to accomplish its objective on a continuing basis with a management and governing structure as approved by the OTP. The Center will have access to a broad range of tools and resources that can be applied to task orders from the OTP.  The Center will be operated on the CONTRACTORs premises----NOT in a Federal building.  The TEC will undertake research projects, including both major long-term studies and quick turn-around policy analyses that focus on the development and application of economic analysis tools in supporting policies for transportation congestion reduction, optimal investment in transportation infrastructure, technological innovation, and the financing of transportation investments and operations.  Research would be conducted by outside experts under contract to the TEC and by scholars in residence at DOT.  The Center would conduct seminars and provide on-going training in transportation economics and infrastructure finance, and provide an opportunity for academic transportation economists to serve as visiting scholars during sabbatical years. 

While the use of most of the TECs resources for research, seminars, etc. would be subject to prior task approval from the OTP, a small portion of the TECs resources would be available for self-initiated exploratory research, literature scans, travel, and other activities necessary to accomplish its mission of supporting the OTPs policy-making role.  It is expected that the TEC would act, on a continuing basis, to bring to the attention of OTP policymakers developments in transportation economics that would be applicable in resolving OTP policy issues.  The TEC would both propose areas for further research exploration and education and respond to taskings from OTP.

Background:  The OTP requires the ability to develop analytic responses to a variety of  transportation policy issues based on sound economic principles and advanced analytic techniques that will assist in providing the Secretary of Transportation with sound and defensible guidance, responding to inquiries from the Congress, preparation of Congressional testimony and  proposed legislation, and evaluating and strengthening policy-oriented products from the Operating Administrations within the DOT.  Of particular importance are issues related to the allocation of Federal transportation resources in addressing congestion, finance, safety, and environmental problems in a cost-beneficial manner. The advantages and disadvantages of alternative financing methods will continue to be of major importance and will require the development and application of sophisticated economic analysis in guiding future policies and legislation.  Over the next few years Congress will be addressing the reauthorization of surface and aviation transportation legislation and the Department will require the ability to provide economic based analyses in formulating, defending, and critiquing proposals that can lead to more efficient transportation investments and policies. 

DOT staff also have a continuing need for exposure to the most current economic thinking and advances in analytic tool development from academicians and others.  Seminars, symposia, and lecture series developed by the TEC will help to meet this need.  Scholars in residence at DOT will also provide this exposure on a direct person-to-person basis.  Further, the TEC should inform the OTP of research results that have important implications for transportation policy development as applied to investment and finance.

Tasks: The following are the primary tasks that the TEC would be required to undertake using a variety of analytic and organizational skills and the capacity to reach out to academicians and other experts in providing high quality economic analysis results in a timely manner:

1.	Establish the Transportation Economics Center. Develop an administrative structure and organization and management plan.  The management plan shall include the name, qualifications, and level of effort of a proposed director of the TSC and level of staff assistance that would ensure the ability of the TEC to accomplish its objective through the contract period.
 
2.	Prepare summaries of important transportation economic papers, research findings, and related sources that inform the OTP of current developments. Prepare research and other proposals for evaluation and approval by the OTP.

3.	Organize seminars, symposia, and conferences on issues related to efficiency of transportation operations and investment, finance, safety, and environmental impacts. Develop other communications media (e.g. newsletters, listservs, etc.) as appropriate.

4	Organize and conduct training in transportation economics and investment 		        
      finance.  DOTs DRAFT estimate is that the contractor, in each and every separate  
      year of this project, will develop, organize, and conduct, in Washington, D. C., one 2-
      day training  course that will have approximately 25 attendees (students). 

5.	Arrange for academicians and other outside experts to serve as visiting scholars in the OTP.

	6.   Accomplish other tasks as needed to achieve TECs objective.


PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Funding in the amount of $100,000 will be available for this projects Base Year when the contract is awarded.  The remaining $400,000 will be allocated to the projects Option Years on a year-by-year basis (but only if, and only to the extent that, DOT exercises those Options), and in accordance with the proposed work for each year as approved by the Contracting Officer. 


DELIVERABLES:  There is no specific set of deliverables that can be pre-specified. The deliverables will be determined by specific task order requests from the OTP as well as by the need for periodic summary reports on research from academic and other sources.

Each offerors INITIALLY-submitted proposal for this project (i.e., proposal for the IDIQ Task Order contract) shall include a detailed work plan for the first year (i.e., the Base Year) of the contract and a detailed management plan that describes how each activity proposed for the first year will be managed by the TEC staff or by outside organizations or individuals under subcontract arrangements with the TEC.  The management plan shall also indicate the approximate amount of resources to be spent on each activity.  The winning offerors detailed work plan for the first year of this project may be amended, through the mutual consent of the contractor and DOT, as the result of discussions that would likely be held within the first month or two of the contracts Base Year. [This is the END of  this projects DRAFT Statement of Work.]***** 

The following is a DRAFT-----not necessarily final----staffing estimate that DOT believes MAY reflect what is needed for this project.  The Center Director should have a graduate degree and a minimum of ten years of work experience relevant to this project.  For any ONE year of the project, it is estimated that the Center Director might devote 25, 50, 80, 10, 10, and 10 hours to Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.  A Transportation Economist / Analyst should have a graduate degree and five years of work experience relevant to this project.  For any ONE year of the project, it is estimated that the Transportation Economist / Analyst might devote 10, 50, 50, 15, 20 and 5 hours to Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.  A Training Course Instructor should have a graduate degree and a minimum of five years of work experience relevant to this project.  For any ONE year of the project, it is estimated that the Training Course Instructor would devote zero, zero, 10, 20, zero, and zero hours to Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.  An Administrative Assistant should have at least a high school diploma and at least one year of work experience relevant to this project, and should be able to use a personal computer and use basic office software and basic computer functions such as Word, Excel, calendars, and e-mail.  For any ONE year of the project, it estimated that the Administrative Assistant might devote 25, 25, 75, 25, 25, and 22 hours to Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.  DOT wishes to emphasize that the foregoing DRAFT staffing estimate, and the staffing estimate that will hereafter appear in the Solicitation for this project, are NOT intended as PRESCRIBED parameters for an offerors proposed staffing.  Instead, and to repeat what was said above, it is anticipated that each offeror will compile its proposal in such a way as to offer the highest level of quality and the greatest amount of value, to DOT and to the taxpayers, that can possibly be provided by that offeror for the offerors total proposed Federal price of $500,000.

In selecting the winning offeror (i.e., the contract awardee), DOT will also take into consideration the Past Performance of the competing offerors.

DOTs DRAFT estimate for this projects UN-loaded travel costs is $6,000 PER YEAR.   But DOT is NOT prescribing any particular travel dollar-figure(s) for offerors to propose.  (All travel must, of course, be done and billed in accordance with Government Travel Regulations.)

DOTs DRAFT estimate for this projects UN-loaded Other Direct Costs (ODCs) is $1,000 PER YEAR.  But DOT is NOT prescribing any particular ODC dollar-figure(s) for offerors to propose.  

The Solicitation will probably require that the winning offeror (i.e, the contractor) obtain DOTs approval of the contractors IT Security Plan for this project, within about 30 days after the contract is awarded.

IT SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR TO CLOSELY AND FREQUENTLY MONITOR THIS FEDBIZOPPS WEBSITE FOR ANY AMENDED SYNOPSES THAT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE PUBLISHED REGARDING THIS PROJECT, AND TO MONITOR FEDBIZOPPS FOR THE FORTHCOMING SOLICITATION FOR THIS PROJECT, AND TO MONITOR FEDBIZOPPS FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION----AS SUCH PUBLICATIONS ALWAYS CONTAIN CRUCIAL INFORMATION.

TELEPHONED, FAXED AND E-MAILED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  INSTEAD, EACH OFFEROR MUST SUBMIT ITS PROPOSAL IN HARD COPY FORM.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis for two AKTA Purifier UPC100 with Frac 920 Liquid Chromatography Systems with GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., 800 Centennial Avenue, P.O. Box 1327, Piscataway, NJ 08855-1327.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1)  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p><br />The following salient characteristics apply to the AKTA Purifier Liquid Chromatography Systems:</p>
<p>&bull;	Ability to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity<br />&bull;	Flow rate change of .01-100 mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-10 MPa (1450 psi).  Must include a motorized valve to enable reverse flow through a column so that elution may be carried out in the reverse direction or columns cleaned in the reverse direction to preserve column integrity.<br />&bull;	two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing<br />&bull;	Entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides.  The pump heads must be titanium with valves and tubing in PEEK.<br />&bull;	system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low-pressure chromatography supports.<br />&bull;	Controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based.<br />&bull;	system should include the option of a fraction collector that is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software. This fraction collector must have the capacity to fractionate into 175 x 12-mm diameter tubes or 95 x 10-18mm tubes.<br />&bull;	System controller must allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs.  The software must allow complete manual control of all parameters and running conditions while running a method.<br />&bull;	Pumps, UV, pH and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collector must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C.<br />&bull;	The controller must accept seven input signals; must be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.<br />&bull;	Include on automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions), which allow for sample loading onto the column.<br />&bull;	Column equilibration before and after sample injection and elution must be capable of being monitored, with a feed-back loop to the control system, so we can be certain equilibration is completed, without consuming excess volume of sometimes expensive buffers.<br />&bull;	Documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive.  Access to the controller must be by user name with password and level of access by each user must be definable by administrator.  The software must be able to operate on the Windows XP operating system.<br />&bull;	Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions should also be included<br />&bull;	definable pressure limit system defined when the column is selected from a list which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit.<br />&bull;	The controller must  allow the user the option of including in his/her chromatographic methods programs, commands which will automatically reduce the flow rate if an over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted from the column. Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger sub-routines (e.g. new tube on fraction collector; valve changes; etc.) should include UV or conductivity signals.<br />&bull;	should permit automatic running of up to 99 different chromatographic programs in a user-designated sequence. It must turn off the pump flow when a signal is received from the fraction collector indicating there are no tubes remaining, so that valuable sample is preserved. The system must automatically and continuously be able to record throughout each chromatographic run the following parameters: flow rate; UV signal; actual AND programmed conductivity of the eluent; eluent pH; system pressure; accumulated time of run; all valve positions and changes in position; activity of a fraction collector - and it must allow these recorded data to be called up later for interpretation and to aid in future replication of results. It must allow for post-run analysis of chromatograms, export of data to other spreadsheet programs, and generation of written reports</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-(b)(1)</p>
<p>(b)    Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>The GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, formally Amersham Biosciences, AKTApurifer UPC 100 with FRAC-920 system is the only LC system which meets all of these requirements. GE Healthcare is the manufacturer and sole source supplier of the AKTApurifier UPC 100 system.  This is the only source know to NCI which can meet these requirements.  It is the only one of its kind and no other known supplier will be able to meet all of these needs.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on July 1, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80097-MM on all correspondence.</p>

(HRI), Rensselaer, New York, entitled Infertility Treatment, Child Growth and Development Through Age Three Years.

This modification will provide for the following:  (1) the acquisition of blood spots left over from mandatory neonatal screening on real-time basis from infants enrolled in the Upstate KIDS study, a 3-year longitudinal follow-up of neurodevelopmental and health outcomes; (2) the conduct of laboratory analysis to determine infants cytokine pattern and toxicity profiles of certain exposures at birth (e.g., bisphenol-A, PCBs), and (3) the conduct of standardized clinical developmental testing between 18  24 months postnatal.  

HRI is in a unique position to coordinate work with the New York State Department of Health (DOH) Wadsworth Center Laboratory.  The Wadsworth Center Laboratory is the site where the blood spots are stored and that will pull the Guthrie cards (blood spots), develop the appropriate methodology for cytokine analysis in blood spots, and carry out the laboratory analysis.  The toxicity testing method will be selected, refined and the analysis conducted by the same laboratory.  Investigators from Wadsworth Center Laboratory who can direct this work can be added to the current contract because HRI represents them for the purposes of contracts administration.  The mission of HRI is to assist New York State DOH to effectively solicit and administer financial support for New York State DOH projects and to disseminate the benefits of New York State DOH expertise.  The Wadsworth Center Laboratory through HRI is the only organization authorized to pull the Guthrie cards and perform the laboratory analysis because the New York State DOH owns the required specimens and can only authorize, in accordance with the New York State law, their designated affiliate, HRI, to obtain and disseminate the required samples from New York State DOH for use in research.

The developmental testing component will be supervised by the Pediatric Director of the Division of Family Health, New York State DOH, who is already also represented by HRI, an investigator under the contract, and currently developing the appropriate algorithm for follow-up of infants and children with neurodevelopmental abnormalities.  Only the State Pediatric Director will have authorized access to the clinical records, the patients and their physicians who are part of our study and be in a position to carry out this requirement. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting information (5 page limit) required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Deliveries should be sent to:

This procurement is a total set-aside for SBA-certified small business concerns under the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) program only.  A separate solicitation will be made available within 30 days from the publication date of this notice.
This requirement is for the management of equipment and supplies owned by EPA Region 9, for use by its Emergency Response Team (ERT).

The contractor will be required to perform inventory control, track and schedule necessary maintenance according to manufacturer?s recommendations, and allow for one hour availability of vehicles, equipment, or supplies when requested by an OSC. Other than minor maintenance or cleaning, the contractor will not be required to perform scheduled maintenance of equipment or any major cleaning or calibrations. The contractor will use an electronic system already in place to track inventories at these facilities.
The San Francisco warehouse is located within the City of San Francisco and is approximately 6000 square feet. It contains a response vehicle and a trailer, electronic or scientific equipment, and consumable supplies used at the sites of environmental cleanups.

The majority of work under this contract will be performed at the warehouse locations; some incidental travel in the performance of the contract may be required in the immediate area (post office, etc.).  In emergency situations, as determined by the OSC or PO, it is anticipated that delivery of emergency response vehicles, equipment, and supplies to emergency response locations will be required.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Cross-Site Evaluation of Childrens Bureaus Child Welfare Technical Assistance Implementation Centers and National Child 
Welfare Resource Centers


The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), Childrens Bureau, through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Department of Health and Human Services is interested in procuring the services of a Contractor to develop and implement a cross-site evaluation of two groups of discretionary grantees, the Child Welfare Technical Assistance Implementation Centers (Implementation Centers) and the National Child Welfare Resource Centers (NCWRCs), including the Collaboration to AdoptUsKids.  These grantees are members of Children Bureaus larger Child Welfare Training and Technical Assistance Network.  The cross-site evaluation will employ a participatory and utilization-focused approach, will build on the work and evaluation findings of the existing T/TA Network and other evaluation contracts, and will include qualitative and quantitative methods.  The Contractor shall address some evaluation questions that examine the role of all T/TA Network members in the performance of the larger network, but the majority of the cross-site will focus on the performance and effectiveness of the Implementation Centers and the NCWRCs. 

By October of 2008, CB anticipates that the T/TA Network will consist of approximately 25 members.  The NCWRCs, the Collaboration to AdoptUsKids(AdoptUsKids), and the Child Welfare Technical Assistance Implementation Centers (Implementation Centers) will account for 13 of these members. The evaluation of the T/TA Network will require the management and administration of multi-phase programmatic technical assistance, data collection, analysis efforts, and written reports. 
This proposed procurement is to be solicited under full and open competition.  It is anticipated that a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Contract will be awarded for a base period of five years, and two twelve-month option years (totaling seven years if all options are exercised).  The contract will be incrementally funded over the contract period of performance consistent with the Contractors responsibilities.  Solicitation 08Y014443 will be issued on or about July 2, 2008, with a tentative closing date of August 1, 2008.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed and demonstrated a juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers that meet its needs for evaluating the survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Hydropower System (FCRPS).   These receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River.  The JSATS receivers utilize either omni-directional or user defined directional hydrophones that consist of a piezoelectric element, shielded amplifier, non-conductive case, and underwater connector; the assembly is able to withstand a nd function at static pressure up to 600K Pa absolute.  This acoustic system has a center frequency at 416.7 KHz.    Specifications for hydrophone directivity and receive sensitivity at 416.7 KHz TBD. Present estimate of minimum acceptable (on axis) receiv e sensitivity at the indicated frequency is -180 dBV//?Pa ? 2 dBV.  To meet the future requirements of juvenile salmon research study plans beginning in 2009 the USACE intends to award a 1 year (with 4 option years) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract for the procurement of omni- and directional hydrophone assemblies that meet its specification requirements.  The solicitation (RFQ) outlining these specifications will be posted on/or about 14 March 2008.

<DESC><p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD on the National Naval Medical Campus, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with GE Healthcare, 800 Centennial Ave., Piscataway, NJ 08855, for the AKTAEXPLORER10S w/Frac-950 &amp; Desktop (13470601).
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b) (1) The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541711.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: 13.106-(b) (1)<br />(b) Soliciting from a single source.<br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>USU requires a chromatography system with tunable wavelengths. This feature is necessary in order to produce extremely pure proteins, which is a requirement in the research of structure analysis being conducted. The AKTAEXPLORER10S has three tunable wavelengths. Each wavelength can detect a different type of molecule, increasing the purity. In addition to the tunable wavelength the AKTAEXPLORER10S has additional features contributing to the purification of biomolecular samples (Air sensors to prevent air bubbles, pressure sensor to monitor sample loading pressures, two-pump gradient system with dynamic mixing) In addition, the controller on the AKTAEXPLORER10S accepts seven input signals, which increases the ability to monitor solutions.</p>
<p>AKTAEXPLORER10S system is the only chromatography system which meets the requirements. GE Healthcare is the manufacturer and sole source supplier of the AKTAEXPLORER10S system. This is the only source known to USU which can meet the requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>In March 2008, the Transportation Security Administration publicly launched the Checkpoint Evolution initiative, a deployment of innovative concepts designed to improve security and improve the checkpoint experience for both passengers and Transportation Security Officers. 

In order to better understand passengers experiences within the current checkpoint environment, TSA has engaged passengers both online with a blog and through a series of focus groups across the United States. The Checkpoint Evolution prototypes that TSA is deploying attempt to address the common frustrations that have been articulated by passengers and take into account passenger behavior at the checkpoint. By addressing these frustrations, TSA aims to calm down the checkpoint environment. 

TSA would like to collect real-time feedback from passengers in airport environments where Checkpoint Evolution prototypes are being tested by placing feedback units at the back side of these checkpoints. This feedback will enable TSA to continue to refine the passenger screening process. 

TSA is interested in a simplified feedback unit that allows for quick passenger responses and engages passengers in a more creative and simplified way than a traditional computer-based survey. The team is envisioning a unit that would display one question at a time from a rotating list of questions, and would allow the user to register a rapid response to the question by pressing one of various response buttons. The response buttons would be labeled with visual picture or symbol. For example, a question might ask What is your perception of our officers uniforms?, and the response buttons would allow the passenger to register their assessment by choosing from easily identifiable pictures or symbols which are also language-neutral.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for RIA Quotation<BR>A.	General Information.  <BR> The Northeast Region, Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia seeks to initiate the standardization process for Monitoring/EKG Electrodes.           <BR>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFRIAQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare System, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the PV Program.  The RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   <BR><BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years.  Anticipated selection date is August 2008.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be cased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  The selected vendor(s) of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone:  202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martin-tilghman@amedd.army.mil.    <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Monitoring/EKG Electrodes, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $164,014.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period and includes the following top high volume usage lines for this project: <BR><BR>PART # 	DESCRIPTION<BR>2560		MONITORING ELECTRODES W/STICKY GEL W/O ABRADER<BR>2570		MONITORING ELECTRODES W/STICKY GEL W/ ABRADER, RADIOLUCENT STUD<BR>2360		RESTING EKG ELECTRODE W/COND.

Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with accompanying electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact (POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the following Northeast Region POC:  larry.shaughnesy@amedd.army.mil (202-782-3666).  All email communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on July 8, 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. <BR><BR>This process will include the above vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria, electronic product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best value price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region POC stated above that their initial submission, product literature, and best price submissions when requested actually arrived at the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  Additionally, vendors will be required to notify the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets.  Voicemail messages for the confirmation of the receipt of the TRBO email request for the no-cost sample sets will NOT be accepted to meet this requirement.           <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Northeast Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate, the required company/company POC information, electronic product literature, and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria listed below to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria responses, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  <BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  <BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be sent forth with the individual criterion.  <BR>3.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Monitoring/EKG Electrodes.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>	a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes disposable electrodes for diagnostic EKG and all EKG monitoring applications to include repositionable-type and radiolucent-type electrodes, with a variety of adhesive backings (foam, soft cloth, tape), snap, tab, and pre-wired chest/limb styles, with a variety of pre-gelled designs (wet-gel, solid gel, and sticky-gel), and available in a variety of diameters/sizes (including for adult, pediatric, infant, and neonatal applications).         <BR>b. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed above.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line as listed above will be disqualified in Phase I.  <BR>	c. Products packaging must be clearly labeled as to contents and must include manufacturing lot number and must include expiration date as appropriate.        <BR>2.  Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Monitoring/EKG Electrodes product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in progress in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I.    <BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV) (currently the Prime Vendor for the Northeast Region is Owens-Minor) for distribution within the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified.  Provide documentation of agreement with PV in response to this RFRIAQ.<BR><BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.    <BR>5.  Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for the Northeast Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ. <BR>6.  Vendors must provide inservice/implementation and ongoing support as needed by Regional MTFs. Vendors must identify company resources for such requirements in response to this RFRIAQ.  Provide electronic literature, if available, describing this support.    <BR>7.  Vendors must provide products that are latex-free.  Vendors must provide a complete list of latex-free products supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFRIAQ.       <BR><BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets and literature from the product group at no cost to the Government or the TRBO POC recipient, to be sent to the TRBO, Clinical Analyst for dissemination to the CPT members for evaluation in a clinical setting.  Vendors will be given ten (10) calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting the no-cast product sample sets in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets to the TRBO Clinical Analyst.  NOTE:  Vendors will be required to notify the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office TRBO, Clinical Analyst by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets.  Voicemail messages for the confirmation of the receipt of the TRBO email request for the no-cost sample sets will NOT be accepted to meet this requirement.  Requested no-cost product sample sets and literature must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO Clinical Analyst address no later than the 10th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets.  Vendors who do not deliver the no-cost product samples by 4:00 PM EDT on the 10th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for no-cost product sample sets.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. <BR><BR>The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar week but may be extended due to staff availability and evaluation site work pace.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)Strongly Disagree; Two (2)Agree; Three (3)Neutral; Four (4)Agree; and Five (5)Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   <BR><BR>The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near 3.75depending on the location of any break: in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.75, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative with a Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold of  3.75:  <BR><BR>1. (Efficiency of Care/Patient Comfort) Electrode packaging allows for simple and quick electrode application. <BR>a. Clinicians require packaging that allows for easy opening and handling of electrodes for quick application and lead attachment leading to timely assessment of patient status.         <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes on at least (3) patients<BR>c. Evaluator will open/remove electrode from packaging, apply to patient skin and attach wire leads (unless pre-wired), and will observe for ease of application process.      <BR>2. (Accuracy of Electronic Signal) Electrode adhesive-backing (or attachment strap for limb lead electrodes) assures full skin contact through use.      <BR>      a. Clinicians require that the electrodes remain in full contact with skin to assure a constant and accurate electronic signal to monitor/record patient status.         <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes on at least (3) patients.<BR>c. After applying the electrode to patients skin, the evaluator will gently pull/tug on connecting lead wire and will observe for quality of electrode adhesive contact (or limb lead attachment strap) with skin.  <BR>3.  (Accuracy of Electronic Signal) Electrode-lead wire connection remains intact through use. <BR>a. Clinicians require that the electrode-lead wire remain in constant connection to assure a constant and accurate electronic signal to monitor/record patient status.        <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes on at least (3) patients.<BR>c. After applying the electrode to patients skin and attaching lead wires (unless pre-wired), the evaluator will gently pull/tug on connecting lead wire (including pre-wired electrodes) and will observe for the quality of the electrode-lead wire connection.       <BR>4.   (Accuracy of Electronic Signal) Electrodes remain in full contact with dry as well as moist skin.    <BR>a. Clinicians require that electrodes remain in full contact with skin under all circumstances including when patient is diaphoretic (sweating) due to changes in physical status   <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes on at least (3) patients.  <BR>c. After applying electrode to patients skin, evaluator will observe the quality of electrode-skin contact when skin moisture is present (if patients skin is dry, moisture is added by water spray mist or moistened towel applied to the patient skin around area of electrode).   <BR>5. (Patient Comfort/Infection Control) Electrode adhesive surface is non-irritating/damaging to the skin during use or during removal.  <BR>a. Clinicians require that the electrode does not cause skin breakdown during use or skin breakdown upon electrode removal from skin.          <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes on at least (3) patients.  <BR>c. Evaluator will observe the condition of the patient skin during electrode removal and after electrode removal for compromise too skin integrity.    <BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  <BR>1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Regionrepresents the new estimated total annual cost including matched and unmatched productsand  reflects the amount the Region would pay  using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Linesunmatched products make vendor comparisons difficult and those in the high usage category has higher impact for post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendorreduction of the number of SKUs handled per period is the intent of the Region; therefore, vendors supplying the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, are more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.    <BR>2.  Vendors that are determined to be Acceptable after review of their responses to the  technical/company criteria, are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.75depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPTwill be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross reference, and value-adds based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The quote will be requested to be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria, are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and do meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.75depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPTwill not be requested to submit pricing quotes and will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.      <BR>3.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Price quotes, cross reference, and value adds must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice to submit.  Those vendors that fail to respond by the deadline date/time will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.<BR><BR>4.  The Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested I the notice to submit RIA pricing.  Vendors quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  <BR>The Northeast Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to make a down selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.   <BR>5.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.   <BR> _____________________________________________________________________________<BR>END<BR>

<DESC>Award a Firm Fixed Price, Level of Effort type contract for the development of a new Navy Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (NTTP) Publication describing the execution and employment of missions within the Naval Construction Force (NCF), primarily focused at the unit level (e.g., NMCBs, CBMUs, UCTs). The proposed contract will be awarded on sole source basis to Thomas Associates Inc. (TAI), 1009 Butterworth Court, Stevensville, MD. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, US Code, Section 2404(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The period of performance for this effort is one year. NTTP 4-04.2 will be written to capture current NCF unit tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTTP) with the intention to standardize best practices and application across the force.  It largely revolves around Commander, FIRST Naval Construction Division subordinate units, but must also include Amphibious Construction Battalions (ACBs) under the Naval Beach Groups.  The NTTP will provide unit commanders, operations officers, company commanders, and staffs of NCF units defined TTP for planning, organization, construction resource management, project monitoring, concept of operations, operational situations and environmental constraints/capabilities, combat operations/mount-out control center operations, specialty organization considerations, intelligence, fire support, chemical biological radiological defense, logistics, communications, and reporting. It will also serve as a useful reference to combatant commanders and their staffs, operational (supported) commanders, supporting commanders, planners, logisticians and Civil Engineer Corps officers/Seabees who conduct general engineering operations. Additionally, this new NTTP will address the latest changes in 1NCD as a result of its transformational activities since 2003 and recent lessons learned from OIF, OEF, exercise related construction, humanitarian assistance construction, and hurricane relief operations.  This document will form the basis of essential naval civil engineering doctrine along with NWP 4-04, Navy Civil Engineering Operations, NTTP 4-04.1M Seabee Operations in the MAGTF, NTRP 4-04.2.1, Doctrinal Reference for the NCF (Final Draft) and NTTP 4-04.3, Naval Contingency Engineering Operations (First Draft).  Accordingly, this effort should be coordinated with the latest promulgated and/or draft documents so as not to cause duplication.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALFOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUpon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contracl action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.1.  Contracting Activity     Department of Veterans Affairs     Austin Information Technology Center     IT Acquisition Center     Austin, TX  787722.  Description of Service and Supplies:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Dentistry plans to contract with Symbologic, Inc. for programming and software maintenance on a sole source basis for VHA Central Dental Laboratories Production and Tracking Application Software.  3.  Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  4.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:    Symbologic, Inc. was  the contractor that developed this software for the VA and has been maintaining the software for the Central Dental Laboratory Reporting System since 1984.  Although the VA owns the software, Symbologic is uniquely qualified to provide the programming and maintenance support as there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition for another contractor to come up to speed and be able to maintain and provide the application enhancements to the software required by this contract. 5.  Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources; Market Research Conducted; and Sources which expressed interest in writing:  This requirement will be posted in FedBizOpps..6.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on historical data, price analysis, and negotiations.7.  Other Supporting Data:  Commercial off-the-shelf dental laboratory software has been reviewed in the past to determine if it meets the needs of the Central Dental Laboratory.  Due to operational differences between private sector dental                                                                                                                          p. 2labs and federal dental labs, the COTS software does not capture the data needed by the Central Dental Lab and VACO Office of Dentistry.8.  Barriers to competition for subsequent acquisitions:   Maintenance and enhancements of this software after this contract period will be assessed for competition as deliverables required under this contract are the full documentation of the system with administrator and end user manuals as well as proof of concept transition to a central database.   The Government may be in a position to maintenance the software in house or have adequate documentation for another contractor to provide maintenance after this contract period of performance is complete.

BACKGROUND	
The NTSB is an independent federal agency charged by Congress to investigate every civil aviation accident in the United States, most public-use aircraft accidents, and significant accidents in other modes of transportation (highway, marine, rail, and pipeline), to conduct special investigations and safety studies, and to issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.  The NTSB Training Center is a major initiative of the Safety Board to improve the training and skills of its own employees, and make its safety expertise and know-how more widely available to the transportation community.  In addition, the Training Center will foster an environment that encourages transportation safety initiatives and technical research; and promote uniform programs that ensure compassion, understanding and assistance for those affected by transportation tragedies.  Additional information about the NTSB and its Training Center can be found at www.ntsb.gov.

The NTSB Training Center completed its third full year at its new facility on the Ashburn, Virginia campus of The George Washington University in September 2006.  Training Center students come from accident investigation agencies around the world; past as well as potential future parties to NTSB investigations, such as equipment manufacturers and unions; disaster relief agencies, including the American Red Cross; and representatives from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.  

This course IM303, titled Human Fatigue is needed to ensure that NTSB investigators, support staff and transportation accident investigation professionals have the opportunity to continually develop and broaden the wide range of skills needed to maintain a high level of performance across the organization.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the University of Vermont, Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry Research, Colchester, VT for laboratory testing on our on-going project Transdermal Testosterone Study.  The laboratory testing is for CRP, IL-6, sIL-6, sGP130, TNFa, Leptin, TNFa RI, Free Testosterone, and Erythropoietin for a total of 900 samples.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C.  253(c) (1), FAR 6.302-1(b) (1).   The cited authority is applicable because the Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry Research, University of Vermont is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.    This laboratory must be used to maintain consistency between studies.  Changing testing laboratories would not be beneficial for the NIA, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging studies/data collected to date.   The period of performance is 3-6 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541380 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.   Award will be made on an all or non basis to the lowest priced, technically acceptable source

<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Economic Development Administration (EDA) was established under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 as amended. EDA's mission is to help states, regions and communities create wealth and minimize poverty by promoting a favorable business environment to attract private capital investment and higher-skill, higher-wage jobs through world-class capacity building, planning, infrastructure, research grants and strategic initiatives. To this end, EDA implemented the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) program several years ago, to measure performance and to translate EDA's strategy and goals into a set of actions and initiatives.</p>
<p>EDA, an agency within the Department of Commerce, recently revised and updated its Balanced Scorecard (BSC) strategic management implementation. The newly revised BSC better quantifies EDA's current niche in the economic development community. The new BSC is currently in use; however, the mechanism for inputting, storing, distributing and analyzing the data must be improved.</p>
<p>The EDA Balanced Scorecard features both financial and operational key performance metrics that measure the consequences of EDA resource investments on community economic development. There are separate scorecards for individual EDA offices, all of which are "rolled up" into an enterprise scorecard. The current method for producing the BSC is a time-consuming, manual quarterly process. This labor intensive method involves too much work from EDA's limited resources, leaves openings for entry errors, and does not provide the necessary involvement from both HQ and Regional Office staff. It also does not provide the analytic capabilities desired by senior staff.</p>
<p>The objective of this purchase request is to procure a COTS software tool that automates EDA's BSC implementation. In addition, the tool must be capable of working within the EDA Oracle environment; interfacing with other EDA databases and software; meeting Federal, DOC and EDA IT security requirements; providing the features required in the areas of functional requirements, technical requirements, and operational requirements; mitigating known risks; and satisfying the evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>2.0 SCOPE</p>
<p>EDA wishes to procure a COTS software tool that automates EDA's BSC implementation. The tool must be capable of working within the EDA Oracle environment; interfacing with other EDA databases and software; meeting Federal, DOC and EDA IT security requirements; providing the features required in the areas of functional requirements, technical requirements, and operational requirements; mitigating known risks; and satisfying the evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a customizable Commercial Off-the-Shelf software product or package that provides for open architecture, provides a well documented migration path to newer software releases, and includes a maintenance and support agreement that provides notification of service releases and hot fixes. EDA wishes to purchase a product that needs a minimum of customization, but still retains the potential for future customization if the need arises due to additional revisions. The vendor must be able to provide onsite training and ongoing product support through an annual maintenance agreement. The vendor must be able to demonstrate past performance of their COTS tool to implement a similar BSC, and the vendor must have a business strategy that shows concrete benefits for EDA.</p>
<p>EDA has sufficient resources available for the initial BSC system design, and for installation, customization and implementation of the BSC COTS tool. The maintenance agreement must allow for technical help calls and problem resolution regarding the installation and customization of the tool. EDA is not seeking other technical services in this purchase.</p>
<p>3.0 STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a customizable Commercial Off-the-Shelf software product or package that meets or exceeds the following requirements.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

<SOLNBR>FERC08-RFP-80999
<RESPDATE>062508
<CONTACT>Sanjay Sardar, Deputy Director of the Chief Information Officer (DCIO), Email FERC08-RFP-8099@ferc.gov
<DESC>								02 June 2008
Request for Proposal:

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Deputy Director of the Chief Information Officer (DCIO)  has a requirement for Independent Test and Evaluation Authority (ITEA) to support quality assurance process for the FERC IT Systems. In order to meet the needs of this requirement, the FERC has determined that the most expeditions method of reviewing and evaluating all offeror capabilities would be through oral presentations.  As such, your are invited to review the technical statement of work located at www.ferc.gov, and specifically, http://www.ferc.gov/about/offices/oed/oed-proc/FERC08-RFP-80999.asp.  You are also instructed to review RFP FERC08-RFP-80148, located at the same URL address, because your ability to perform ITEA for the services procured under this competition may also be required during the life of the awarded ITEA contract.
.
In order to meet federal competitive requirements as well as program schedule requirements, the FERC has determined that a competition utilizing streamlined procedures is the best overall approach to meet these goals.  As previously stated, all potential offerors shall provide their technical approach utilizing an oral presentation.  This process possesses certain rules that the offeror must abide by.  Failure to follow the following rules shall render the presentation non responsive, and therefore, unavailable for award.

-	Technical Solution and Methodology must conform to the requirements of the Technical Statement of Work, dated June 02,  2008, and located at http://www.ferc.gov/about/offices/oed/oed-proc/FERC08-RFP-80999.asp
-	Only technical information shall be presented
-	No more than 30 slides 
-	The presentation shall not require a presentation lasting more than 60 minutes
-	The offeror shall provide a detailed response for each evaluation factor listed in Section 3. of the Technical Statement of Work, dated June 02, 2008. 
-	Questions are due not later than Tuesday, June 10, 2008, 5:00PM EDT, and shall be forwarded by email to sanjay.sardar@ferc.gov.  Failure to meet this date/time shall cause you to forfeit your opportunity to submit questions.
-	Oral Presentation offers are due not later than Wednesday, June 25, 2008, 5:00PM, EDT, and shall be forwarded by email to sanjay.sardar@ferc.gov.  Failure to meet this deadline shall render your oral presentation nonresponsive and therefore unavailable for award.

Once received, the FERC may require some or all of the offerors to present their oral presentations to a technical evaluation team.  Conversely, the FERC may decide that a competitive range be established without benefit of holding presentations. Under either scenario, you will be notified via email. If oral presentations are to be held, all date/time slots shall be randomly assigned.  It is the intention of this competition to award a single contract to one firm (or a team of firms for which the lead offeror is accountable) for the work to be performed and on the basis of the overall best value to the government.  As such, upon completion of the technical review, the government team shall down select to three (3) or fewer technical proposals, thereby establishing the competitive range.  Those offerors chosen for the competitive range shall be notified via email and a cost proposal shall be requested.  Upon evaluation of the cost proposal, the government shall enter discussions with one or more offerors, if necessary.  Award shall be made to that offeror determined to be the best overall value to the government. The government reserves the right to award to the lowest priced offeror.

<DESC><p>The Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) is required to replace the AN/TPS-75 radar as the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aircraft and missiles in support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander through the Ground Theater Air Control System. The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance, control of aircraft, and theater ballistic missile detection. The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions. In the case of theater missile defense operations, the new radar will have the capability to detect, track, and disseminate target information to respective command and control nodes such as the USAF Control and Reporting Center to disseminate for warning and engagement. Similarly, the joint targeting process will benefit from trajectory information provided by the 3DELRR, which will include launch and impact location. The 3DELRR will correct current radar system shortfalls by providing the capability to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets as well as classify and determine the type of a non-cooperative aircraft. It will also mitigate most of the sustainability and maintainability concerns which plague the current system.</p>

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS<br />13 May 2008
<p><br />The 62d Contracting Squadron at McChord AFS is soliciting for a indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity construction contract (IDIQ). This acquisition is for a requirement contract for a one year base period plus two, one year option periods.</p>
<p>The work consists of all plant, labor, equipment and materials for the execution of interior painting of various Military Family Housing (MFH) units for Project No. 07-4009A/B/C entitled IDC Paint Interior MFH at McChord AFB, Washington.</p>
<p>JOINT BASE LEWIS / MCCHORD: McChord Air Force Base and Fort Lewis are in the process of combining various functions and requirements as a result of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Joint Basing guidelines. This contract may add the requirements of Fort Lewis to this McChord contract at a subsequent time or in a subsequent option year, or the requirements of this contract may be added to a Fort Lewis contract at a subsequent time in which case an option to this contract may possibly not be exercised. Any additional requirements may increase quantity of work or the number of positions. Any additional requirements may not necessarily change the scope as to task performed.</p>
<p>MFH PRIVATIZATION: Congress has mandated the privatization of McChords Military Family Housing (MFH); however, the timetables are largely unknown and outside the span of control of McChord AFB.</p>
<p>The award will be made using Price Performance Trade Off procedures in accordance with FAR 15 and the terms in the RFP. The term is anticipated for one base year and two option periods. This will be a requirements-type contract awarded unrestricted in accordance with the Small Business Competiveness Demonstration Program. The magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The work to be preformed under this IDIQ acquisition will be within the North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) 238320 - Paint and Wall Covering Contractor.</p>
<p>The exact closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation including specifications and drawings, will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website at hhtp://www.fedbizopps.gov. Hard copies will not be available. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package, which will be on or about <strong>25 June 08</strong> and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and drawings. Potential offerors MUST registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and ORCA database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractors Registration at web site http://www.ccr.gov/ and ORCA at web site http://orca.bpn.gov/.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation cost.</p>
<p>Please Note: Past Performance documentation addressed in Section L of the solicitation will be required not later than five calendar days prior to the closing of the proposal.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of the Brand Name Component, Monaco System Transceivers, or Industry EQUIVALANTS, as described below, for multiple upcoming construction projects at Fort Drum, NY for 2008 through 2009.  No awards will be made from this Sources Sought Notice.  No solicitation will be available at this time.  However, responses to this Sources Sought Notice will be used to determine an appropriate acquisition strategy for future acquisitions.  

The New York District intends to solicit and award multiple construction projects for Fort Drum, NY for 2008 through 2009. The multiple construction projects will be solicited competitively under future separate solicitations. These projects will include a Brand Name Only component, as described below, unless the results of this sources sought notification indicates otherwise.  

This notification serves three purposes:  (1) to notify potential offerors of the Governments intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction project for 2008 through 2009 and (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and (3) notification of the Army's intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, system Monaco, as described below.  The Monaco System Transceiver is embedded in the multiple construction projects, which projects will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the projects requiring the Monaco System Transceiver is sole source if no sources are able to provide an equivalent system. In the event no equivalent equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.   A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or system(s) in the event an equivalent product is not submitted for consideration.  In such instances, the brand name or equal component will be embedded in the construction project that will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring brand name components will be sole source if no sources are able to prove an equal product.  Supplies will be providing the brand name component to the contractor under the future solicitation for the construction of the project, not directly to the Government.

SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:  The multiple construction projects will include Brand Name only equipment for building fire alarm radio transceivers manufactured by Monaco Enterprises. These projects with their many state-of-the-art building components require reliable receiving and reporting building fire alarm systems. It has been determined that a microprocessor based radio controlled fire reporting system is the best compatible alternative to be used with the existing system.  Fort Drum currently uses the Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.  No other product has been found that can be considered interchangeable with or equal to the Monaco D-21 Enhance Central Radio Alarm System.  The only remote transceiver that will communicate with this make of base transceiver is the Monaco model BT-X series.  The required features of the BT-XM Fire Alarm Building Transceiver are as follows:

(1) Hardwire line or narrowband radio communication with any of the D-21 Fire Management System; 
(2) Narrowband radio is FCC certified for narrowband operation and meets the requirements of the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Frequency Management; 
(3) Radio communication with the D-21; 
(4) Provides audio and fire alarm overrides for mass notification per UFC and NFPA; 
(5) Provides automatic and manual control of local or remote devices such as turning on pumps based on timed events, input from a fire alarm control panel, or manually activated from the D-21; 
(6) Provides eight relay driver outputs and four supervised zone inputs; 
(7) Eight onboard open-collector relay driver outputs can connect to the BT-XM relay board or to relay coils that remotely control equipment such as pump activation inputs, HVAC dampers, lighting, door openers, runway barriers, and gates. These outputs can also drive remote enunciator LEDs; 
(8) Four supervised fire zone inputs for connection to fire detection and monitoring devices located within 15 feet of the BT-XM; these are supervised for open (trouble), short (alarm), single-ground fault, and double-ground fault conditions; 
(9) Four zone LEDs (one for each zone) reflect the condition of the zones: trouble, alarm, or normal; 
(10) Status LEDs reflect the status of the BT-XM: general alarm, general trouble, system fault, in-communication, carrier detect, transmit, primary power, battery boost charge, and battery float charge; 
(11) Supports up to 31 zone expansion backplanes into which fire and audio expansion cards can be plugged; 
(12) Each zone expansion card provides four zone inputs and eight relay outputs for connection to local or remotely located devices; 
(13) Each expansion card has five LEDs: the PWR LED indicates power is being supplied to the card; the remaining four LEDs indicate the status of the four zone inputs; 
(14) Each BT-XM can support up to 252 zones and 504 relay outputs with 62 expansion cards installed; 
(15) One selectable RS-422/RS-485 port for communication with peripheral equipment or connection to a local access controller. An alternative use of this port is hardwire connection to multiple BT-XM units connected together for communication with the D-21; 
(16) Two full-duplex RS-232 ports used to program the BT-XM via connection to a laptop computer or for connection to peripheral equipment that does not have a RS-422 port/RS-485 port; 
(17) 115 or 230 Vac power monitored with automatic switchover to backup battery power that provides standby power; the number of hours depends on the battery 
Self test, stuck transmitter disconnect, reset, acknowledge, and battery reconnect switches; 
(18) Local audible alert; 
(19) Real-time clock and calendar; 
(20) 1/2 Mb of program memory; 
(21) 1/2 Mb of non-volatile data storage; 
(22) Fits in a variety of enclosures; the enclosure size depends upon how many expansion cards are needed; 
(23) Factory Mutual approved

Any vendor wishing to provide a system that is compatible with the existing Monaco system must provide a copy of its brochure and any other data by 14 calendar days from date of issue, NO LATER THAN 26 JUNE 2008, 4:00 PM EST, to Contract Specialist, Elizabeth A. Stanley, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, N.Y., New York 10278.

This is a market survey and notification of intent only. This is not a
request to respond to a solicitation.  This project will be solicited at a future date.
