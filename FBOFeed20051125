<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation but rather a market survey to determine potential sources.  The United States Air Force, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Global Information Grid Systems Group, Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) Program Office (GIGSG/KM) is seeking a qualified contractor for Improvement and Sustainment (formerly CLS), to include both hardware and software, for the Defense Injection/Reception Emergency Action Message Command and Control Terminal (DIRECT) (formerly the Defense IEMATS Replacement Command and Control Terminal) for March 2006 through February 2007, with annual options through February 2011. DIRECT was developed, produced, and installed by General Dynamics C4 Systems (formerly GTE Government Systems), Needham, MA, under contract F19628-96-C-0126.  General Dynamics provided CLS under contract F19628-01-C-0053 from May 2001 through September 2005 and is currently providing CLS under a Bridge contract for the period Sep 05 - Feb 06.  Overall DIRECT Improvement and Sustainment Contract (DISC) objectives are:  (1) provide organizational maintenance at the sites where DIRECT is installed, (2) provide depot maintenance for both hardware and software, (3) accomplish Technical Refresh of all systems to avoid system degradation caused by parts obsolescence and inability to obtain support for vendor items, (4) perform Special Studies as authorized by the Government, (5) accomplish Work Requests for repair of failed items as authorized by the Government, (6) install one additional system presently in storage at a site to be determined, and (7) update DIRECT communications system interfaces as required by user agencies.  Seven systems are currently installed in Nuclear Combatant Commander command centers at NMCC, NMCC Site R, USJFCOM, USSTRATCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and USEUCOM.  Additional systems may be added to alternate locations in the future.  An additional system resides at General Dynamics as a development/test and sustainment system.  DIRECT consists of both commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment and equipment designed and built by General Dynamics.  DIRECT utilizes a two-level maintenance concept--organizational and depot.  Organizational level hardware maintenance will be performed by contractor on-site technicians in TOP SECRET/OPSPLAN 8044-ESI facilities and will consist of system restoration by fault verification/isolation, removal/replacement of the faulty Line Replaceable Unit (LRU), and functional checkout using existing technical manuals and other technical data.  Potential sources must provide appropriately cleared maintenance technicians at each site which can be utilized on an on-call-as-required basis to support DIRECT.  For newly designed equipment, depot level hardware maintenance will consist of diagnostic analysis, using contractor-provided common support equipment, of returned LRUs to isolate faulty Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs), the removal and replacement of faulty SRUs, and functional checkout.  SRUs in most instances will consist of circuit cards, power supplies, or fiber optics transmitters/receivers.  The DISC contractor will determine the most cost-effective means of repair for each COTS hardware item consistent with meeting required system performance criteria and availability of commercial technical data.  A commercial drawing package, an organizational level maintenance manual, and depot troubleshooting procedures for General Dynamics-designed LRUs are available.  Two DIRECT Engineering Development Model (EDM) systems, one production system, and two Message Generator/Receivers will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  No other peculiar depot test equipment or test program sets are available. The DISC contractor will conduct site surveys and produce, deliver, install, and check out equipment in alternate locations as required. Software maintenance will consist of periodic updates (estimated two per year) to implement changes to OPSPLAN 80

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice:

The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing thirty (30) Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assemblies.  The assembly consists of the items as listed:  30 each Wheel Speed Transducer, and 30 each Hubcap.  The function of the entire assembly is to sense wheel speed at landing to prevent skid on a runway by communicating with an on-board control unit that monitors brake application pressure.  Other salient characteristics are described below:

Two wheel speed transducers provide individual wheel velocity measurement for each of the braked wheels. The transducers have axle adapters to allow them to be mounted inside the axles.  The transducer-adapter assembly is secured by threaded fasteners protruding through the axle and castellated wheel axle nuts.  The transducer shaft extends from the transducer toward the hubcap.  On the shaft a drive coupling is installed, which is driven by the hubcap drive mechanism.  The field-proven hubcap-transducer drive interface is of sufficient rotational stiffness and strength to prevent transmission of erroneous wheel speed velocity signals.  The coupling design can accommodate angular and parallel misalignment and axial assembly tolerance without degradation such as premature bearing or drive coupling wear.  The transducer is a variable reluctance alternator with 36 polies (teeth) on the rotor with 36 matching poles (teeth) on the stator.  The magnetic field is provided by a coaxial coil energized by the control unit transducer bias current.  With the excitation applied, a static magnetic field is established between the north and south poles of the rotor, air gap, stator and return path iron of the transducer, and no output is produced.  As the wheel rotates, rotor teeth pass the stator slots and teeth, causing variations in the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, which causes a change in the flux linking the coil.  The transducer output is, therefore, a sinusoidally varying voltage, with a frequency directly proportional to wheel rotational velocity.

Transducer Weight:  The weight of the wheel speed transducer is 1.1 pounds.  The weight will be further defined after final axle adapter design.  The transducer weight does not include the weight of the hubcap, which is included in the total system weight estimate.

Please note that this synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids/proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide complete Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assemblies listed above.  

Firms responding to this synopsis must identify their company’s capabilities to perform the requirements described herein, reference the synopsis number and indicate whether or not that they are a small or small disadvantaged business concern as defined in FAR 52.219-1.  The NAICS code is 336413.  The Small Business size standard is 1000 employees.  

The information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this sources sought synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this sources sought synopsis.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded in Jan of 2006. 

All responses may be sent via e-mail to Philip.cheng@edwards.af.mil or mailed to 412 TW/PKDB, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Philip W. Cheng.  Fax Number: 661-275-7827.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are due in the office by Close of Business (COB), 9 Dec 2005.
