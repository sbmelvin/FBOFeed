<p>2. CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION: Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 3 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Cost, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax and email)(this section is NOT included in the page count); Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA 09-09-RIKA with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.</p>
<p>3.

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: <br />Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p><br />3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>David Krzysiak<br />Telephone: (315) 330-7454<br />Email: David.Krzysiak@rl.af.mil</p>

<DESC><p>PRE SOLICIATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research, Morgantown, WV has a requirement to provide NIOSH with ITCP safety Train-the-Trainer products(s) for distribution to safety training organizations and construction company safety personnel.
<p>The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>Title: Internal Traffic Control Plan Train-the-Trainer Program</p>
<p>I. Background and Need</p>
<p>In 2001, NIOSH began a research program to identify, adapt, and evaluate promising strategies for preventing worker injuries caused by ground workers being struck by construction vehicles and equipment operating inside road construction work zones. In the course of conducting this research, NIOSH staff developed information about equipment blind areas, equipment movement patterns, worker activity around paving operations, and an Internal Traffic Control Plan (ITCP) training course. The ITCP training course is roughly 3 hours in length and involves a PowerPoint presentation, activity table, and worksheets. Stakeholders in the roadway construction industry have expressed interest in an ITCP train-the-trainer program. NIOSH requires assistance in developing such a program that is based on the ITCP training course. The program will be used to train safety training organizations and construction company safety personnel who, in turn, will train personnel who work around road construction paving operations.</p>
<p>II. Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide NIOSH with an ITCP Train-the-Trainer Program for distribution to safety training organizations and construction company safety personnel.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work</p>
<p>NIOSH will work with the vendor in reviewing research results and safety materials to identify information that will be included in the ITCP Train-the-Trainer Program. Based on input from the safety training organizations and construction company safety personnel, the vendor shall develop an ITCP Train-the-Trainer Program for the target audience using a design that will effectively communicate the information. The program shall include all informational products that will be presented to and used by the Train-the-Trainer trainees (referred to as the trainer trainees) and the road construction worker trainees (referred to as the end trainees). The vendor shall produce a prototype Train-the-Trainer Program for review by NIOSH, revise the program based on NIOSH input, and complete an initial production run of the final program. The vendor shall offer a Train-the-Trainer Program session, including distribution of training materials, at an annual conference sponsored by the vendor.</p>
<p>IV. Tasks to be Performed</p>
<p>A. Review of NIOSH Research Results and Safety Materials - The vendor shall secure appropriate space and arrange for NIOSH researchers to make presentations to the vendor and a panel of 6-10 safety training organizations and construction company safety personnel. NIOSH staff will present an overview of research projects and results related to preventing workers from being struck by construction vehicles and equipment, a background on the development of the ITCP training course, and an abbreviated ITCP training course. <br /><br />B. Obtain Input from Safety Training Organizations and Construction Company Safety Personnel - The vendor shall secure appropriate space and conduct a meeting with the panel of safety training organizations and construction company safety personnel to evaluate and obtain input on the content of and direction for the final Train-the-Trainer Program. Although NIOSH staff will participate in the meeting, the vendor shall be responsible for using meeting discussions to identify modifications to content, presentation, and format for the program to ensure that it will effectively communicate the information to the target audience(s).</p>
<p>C. Develop Equipment Blind Area Safety Video Clip(s) - Using government furnished materials, the vendor shall develop at least one equipment blind area safety video clip. The clip(s) will be included in the Train-the-Trainer Program for presentation to both the trainer trainees and the end trainees. The clip(s) may also be used by NIOSH in other blind area training programs. The vendor will work with NIOSH to develop the clip(s). The clip(s) will demonstrate what the operator sees from inside a dump truck including, but not limited to, the front view, mirror views, rear view, and obstructed front view. The clip(s) will show a person on the ground walking in front of the truck, behind the truck, and up the right side of the truck.</p>
<p>D. Design and Produce Prototype Program - The vendor shall do all design work on the informational product(s) that will be included in the Train-the-Trainer Program. The final informational product(s) will be presented to and used by both the trainer trainees and the end trainees. The vendor shall submit 5-10 prototypes of each product for NIOSH review. Prototype products shall include, but are not limited to, PowerPoint type presentation, train-the-trainer booklet, sample trainee booklet, activity worksheets, and other suggested training materials. <br /><br />E. Revise and Complete Production Run - Based on NIOSH review comments, the vendor shall revise the Train-the-Trainer Program and complete an initial production run. For NIOSH distribution, the vendor shall produce approximately 20 units of the final program, including all informational products intended for presentation to and use by the trainer trainees and the end trainees. In addition to these 20 units, the vendor shall produce approximately 50 units for distribution during the Train-the-Trainer Program session at the vendor sponsored annual conference. The number of units to be produced under this acquisition for distribution at the annual conference will be negotiated between the vendor and NIOSH after NIOSH approves the final Train-the-Trainer Program.</p>
<p>F. Conduct a Train-the-Trainer Program Session at the Annual Conference - The vendor shall advertize a session for the Train-the-Trainer Program in the conference literature, manage the attendance, secure appropriate space, conduct the program, and provide all informational products needed by the attendees to complete the Train-the-Trainer Program. The vendor shall evaluate the Train-the-Trainer Program conference session and provide NIOSH with a report that includes an evaluation of conference session presentation, as well as an evaluation of the Train-the-Trainer Program content and format.</p>
<p>G. Provide Progress Reports - The vendor shall provide NIOSH with quarterly updates on progress toward completing tasks.</p>

Procurement of Follow-on Maintenance support for this would include (8 hours) 5x8 next day phone support and SUS (Software Update Service) to include: Telephone/Web assistance, remote support and software update/upgrade services. ENM currently owns this software product so upgrades must be acquired by the same Indicative Brands.  If the maintenance and upgrades are not procured under the same Brand Name ENM runs the risk of violating our maintenance agreement and could incur copyright violations.An identification of the stautory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 41 USCODE 253 (C) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. A demonstration that the propsed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement. ENM currently utilizes the Indicative products and requires the maintenance support in order to provide updates and upgrades as needed.  The product we own "Indicative" is the property of Nimsoft. The only entity able to provide upgrades, bug fixes, or cover any issues with the product is Nimsoft. It's important we move on this to maintain our coverage for the product. The ILMS application relies on this product to identify performance issues throughout the network.<BR><BR>

These solenoid valves are to be used on panels attached tothe Mobile Launcher Platform and will be used to support missions to the InternationalSpace Station, to the Moon, and eventually Mars.  The Flodyne valves are large,pneumatically operated ball valves with very large CVs (flow coefficient). These valvesare used for high flow/high pressure applications. These valves will perform variousfunctions on the Ares I Mobile Launcher and Launch Tower. Some of the critical functionsare controlling flows to the vehicle for cryo load, on-board bottle fills (GN2, GHe, GO2,Bair), pre-press functions (both LO2 and LH2) and hazardous vehicle purges. In addition,some of the valves will be used to verify no leakage prior to committing to launch. Flodyne solenoid valves are high performance, proven technology designed for use inground support equipment. They have been used extensively in ground support functions forthe Apollo and Shuttle programs in critical applications. These legacy valves are wellunderstood by our technicians and precision cleaning contractors and we have anestablished logistic supply chain (spare parts, spare valves). The Flodyne valves haveKSC 79K series drawings associated with them and are ordered by the specific KSC 79Knumber. They have been qualified for use by the Apollo and Shuttle Programs at KSC forcritical applications in the demanding launch environment. The use of another source ofvalves (if there was one) would require developing new 79K drawings and requalificationof the valves.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Experimental Immunology Branch plans to procure the brand name Autogen Gene Prep Automated DNA Extraction System with Autogen; 84 October Hill Road; Holliston, MA 01746.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12  Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified acquisition procedures for commercial item.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.

Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1. Statute

Statute: 41 U.S.C. 253 (1) as set forth in FAR 13.106-(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)

(b) Solicitation from a single source. 

(2) For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.   


2.  Sole Source Justification:

The Experimental Immunology Branch maintains a 16,000 mouse colony for the production of mice for research.  This colony as well as other animal facilities generate >60,000 samples that require genotyping annually.  The work has previously been completed using two Autogen 740 DNA extraction machines.  It is critical to maintain the ability to process these samples in a rapid manner in order to maintain the current level of mouse census.  The new machine has an increased throughput that will allow one machine to replace the two instruments currently in operation within the lab.  The Autogen machine has the added advantage of using some of the same accessories (tubes) from the previous machines if desired. 

The instrument satisfying the Experimental Immunology Branch requirements shall meet the following salient characteristics: 

System shall:

1.	be fully automated for the isolation of DNA from mouse tail/animal tissue.
2.	have the ability of processing, unattended, up to 192 samples in 8 hours.
3.	integrate the enzymatic digestion of up to 48 tissue samples simultaneously 	as part of the automated run.
4. 	have 6 independent reagent reservoirs, integral 48 sample swinging bucket rotor centrifuge module, shaking heater module and XYZ robotics sample handling. 
5.	be menu driven, microprocessor controlled with easy to use LCD touch panel screen.
6. 	utilize the same patented chemistry for nucleic acid comprising 6 steps done at ambient temperature currently being used in the requesters core facility.  System does not require a filter or column for the recovery of nucleic acids.
7. 	process 16 - 48 samples in specifically designed plastic centrifuge tube units 	(8 samples/tube unit) and be able to utilize currently used centrifuge tubes(6 	samples/tube).
8.	have the ability to process 0.5-3.0 ml volumes.
9. 	provide high quality DNA for direct use in Sequencing reactions, PCR, 	Southern blotting and more.
10. 	be a floor-standing instrument for ease of movement; dimensions are 60.4 inches high; 28.3 inches wide and 26.4 inches deep.
11.	offer pre-programmed protocols and the ability to save up to 7 individual user programs.
12.	have the ability to run unattended, overnight.
13.	not use disposable pipette tips.
14. 	have a consumable cost of less than $0.80 per sample prep.

Autogen is the only known manufacturer of this to provide the necessary comparable sample throughput, a high quality product, and an adequate degree of automation to serve the requirements within the lab.

<SUBJECT>Clinical Lot of K562 GM-CSF cells, including irradiation of the intermediate bulk and cGMP fill and finish, to be used for clinical research
<SOLNBR>NCI-90121-NG
<RESPDATE>071409
<CONTACT>Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov - Caren N Rasmussen, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email cr214i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure a clinical lot of K562 GM-CSF cells, including irradiation of the intermediate bulk and cGMP fill and finish, to be used for clinical research with Johns Hopkins University (JHU); 733 North Broadway; Baltimore, Maryland 21205.
 	
The supplies and services herein are commercial as described in FAR Part 12 and the supplies and services are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.501.  
 
The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12M.

Period of Performance shall be from July 20, 2009 through February 28, 20010.  Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. 

The purpose of this requirement is to acquire a clinical lot of irradiated K562 cells engineered to secrete human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (K562 him-CSF).  Contractor shall have facilities that are FDA approved for cell vaccine production.  Vaccination of cancer patients with allogeneic tumor cells expressing high levels of multiple CT antigens in combination with depletion of T regulatory cells will induce broad immunity to these antigens.  A NCI-IRB approved protocol has been written to examine this issue.  Briefly, patients with resectable lung and esophageal cancers, and malignant pleural mesotheliomas will be vaccinated with irradiated K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing GM-CSF (K562 hGM-CSF) following completion of appropriate combined modality therapy.  

Johns Hopkins University is the only known source, to the NCI, that developed these cells and adapted to growth in serum-free media.  These cells are not available from any other known source.  In addition, it is not known that other institutions have experience producing these cells for human cancer vaccine trials.  JHU is currently conducting three clinical studies using clinical lots of K562 hGM-CSF (Irradiated) Cells produced and released by the Cell Processing and Gene Therapy facility (CPGT) at JHU.  These CPGT K562 hGM-CSF (Irradiated) clinical lots have exhibited an excellent safety profile in leukemia patients.  
    
Critically, production of this clinical product requires irradiation of freshly harvested cells.  The CPGT at JHU has a qualified, maintained cesium irradiator to facilitate the irradiation of fresh bulk cell product, followed by the immediate fill and finish of the bulk cell product into final sterile vials.  This irradiation is absolutely necessary for patient safety, as mandated by CBER of the FDA, to ensure that the cells are fully inhibited in their growth.  For the consistency of data and patient care, changing variables at this time will be detrimental to current research studies at the NCI.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Contractor shall provide one (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM ET July 14, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed or emailed to the following: Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  It is the contractors responsibility to ensure all questions have been received in the contracting office.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA).  

Please reference NCI-90121-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH intends to negotiate with the Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine (URCRM) located in the Russian Federation, a contract consisting of one base-year and three one-year options, for support services titled Support for Epidemiologic Studies of the Mayak and Techa River Cohorts.  This is a renewal of contract #N01-CP-45505 with the URCRM, whose work on this study of the Mayak and Techa River Cohorts in the Russian Federation extends back more than 10 years, as a subcontractor on predecessor contracts with the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), #N01-CP-81034 and #N01-CP-11014.

The Extended Techa River Cohort (ETRC) is comprised of 29,749 persons, of all ages and both sexes, born before 1950, who lived in any of the 41 villages situated on the Techa River between 1950 and 1960.  Cohort members were primarily exposed to external cesium-137 and internal strontium-90 from radioactive wastes released into the river by the Mayak nuclear weapons facility, the largest nuclear weapons facility in the former Soviet Union, which began operations in 1948.

This renewal will be negotiated directly with the URCRM as a support services contract, supporting REB investigators by providing cancer mortality data necessary to quantify cancer mortality risks from protracted low dose rate exposure to external radiation and internal exposure to strontium.  Results of analyses conducted thus far have demonstrated that this study has the power to detect and quantify risks of long term carcinogenic effects of low to moderate chronic radiation exposures.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate using other than full and open competition under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to continue with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION 45-DAY NOTICE FOR FEDBIZOPPS

Notice Number:  NIH-NHLBI-HC-45-10-07

Project Title:	Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Follow-up Study

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH intends to negotiate on a non-competitive, sole source basis with Wake Forest University, the Coordinating Center for the Action to control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) to award a Follow-up Study. The cited authority is 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This effort will be a five-year follow-up of the ACCORD clinical trial participants.  This contractor has been involved in the recruitment, treatment strategies, follow-up, collection and analysis of data, and reporting of results on 10,251 participants from seven clinical networks across the United States and Canada. The incumbent contractor has the unique capability to provide these required services to NHLBI for the follow-up of the study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. The objectives of the study are detailed below.

Background and Purpose of the ACCORD Trial: About 24 million people (almost 8% of the U.S. population) have diabetes, which costs the nation an estimated $174 billion annually.  People with type 2 diabetes have 2-4 times the rate of major cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared to those without diabetes.  With increasing diabetes rates in the nation, the attributable risk of CVD due to diabetes is increasing.

The goal of the ACCORD trial is to address this public health challenge by testing three complementary medical treatment strategies to enhance the options for reducing CVD rates in people with diabetes. ACCORD is a randomized, multicenter, factorially designed clinical trial in 10, 000 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus conducted in 77 clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada.  The current infrastructure comprises 7 clinical networks, one coordinating center, a central laboratory, an ECG reading center, and a Drug Distribution Center. The trial has been ongoing since September 30, 1999. Wake Forest has been the coordinating center since then.

The trial was designed to test the effects on major CVD events of a therapeutic strategy to control glycemia to near-normal levels (target HbA1c < 6%) compared to a standard strategy (target HbA1c between 6% and 7%), of fibrates added to statins  (compared to statins alone) to increase HDL-cholesterol and lower triglycerides in the context of good LDL-C control, and of intensive BP control targeting the normal range (SBP< 120 mmHg) compared to a standard BP control strategy (SBP between 130 and 140 mmHg).  All 10,251 participants are in the glycemia trial; 5,518 are in the lipid trial and 4,733 are in the BP trial. The primary outcome for all 3 trials is first occurrence of a major CVD event (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death). The trial included substudies on the investigation of the effects of the treatment strategies on cognition (the MIND substudy); on retinopathy and its progression over time (the EYE substudy); and the Health Quality of Life substudy. Each of these substudies involved substantial fractions of the overall ACCORD study participants. The recruitment phase was completed September 30, 2005 when the study surpassed their goal of 10,000 participants and recruited 10,251 participants.  In February, 2008, the ACCORD Glycemia protocol was modified due to safety concerns. All participants in the intensive Glycemia intervention arm were transitioned into the standard Glycemia treatment arm. The protocol remained otherwise unchanged with follow up continuing as planned until June 30, 2009.  After  June 30, 2009 all patients who give consent will have telephone only follow-up visits every six months (up to December 31, 2010) to assess the occurrence of major cardiovascular events

ACCORD Follow-Up Study Objectives:  A 5-year observational ACCORD follow-up study is anticipated from September 30, 2010 through September 29, 2015.  During this time, all ACCORD participants will be invited to provide informed consent for continued follow-up measurements.  An estimated 92% of the original 10,251 participants is anticipated to be available for follow-up, based on current numbers of deaths, losses-to-follow-up, and refusals.

The follow-up will determine whether differences seen during the study in mortality, CVD events, and microvascular diseases persist or change over time and whether other differences emerge. The goals of the follow-up phase is to obtain key clinical, biological and ECG data that are similar in quality to those obtained during the trial period to enable examination of trends over time.  Examining morbidity and mortality from both macrovascular and microvascular diseases will provide a complete picture regarding long-term vascular outcomes from diabetes and the impact of glucose, blood pressure lowering, and lipid treatment on those outcomes. The follow-up phase will consist of periodic clinic visits for data collection and interim phone contacts to obtain information about clinical events.  Clinic visits would use streamlined approaches from current methods to obtain key clinically-relevant data that are the most important measures for the glycemia, BP, and lipid trials. Information to be collected would be detailed by investigators but is envisioned as including the following:  BP; medications; blood for HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, lipids, and creatinine; and urine for creatinine and albumin.  As currently, a central laboratory would conduct biological specimen analyses. ECGs would be obtained to identify silent myocardial infarctions, and clinical events would be adjudicated.  A specific protocol will be developed upon award.

It is anticipated that the National Eye Institute will continue funding an Eye substudy and that the National Institute on Aging will continue a cognitive substudy, and that the CDC will continue a Health Related Quality of Life substudy, as these substudies provide important clinical information.

The Coordinating Centers expected responsibilities that will continue during the follow up phase include (but are not limited to) all data management and analysis activities including the documentation and maintenance of appropriate confidentiality and security of files for the study and substudies; lead the development of the protocol and manuals of procedures development; monitor the regulatory aspects of the study; establish standardized quality of data gathering; continue to maintain a morbidity/mortality monitoring and adjudication system; maintain quality control and monitoring of the performance status of the clinical sites; solicit and monitor core laboratories such as central ECG and  chemistry laboratory; coordinate, arrange, participate in, and provide any information necessary for regular Steering Committee, Observations Study Monitoring Board, training and other necessary study meetings; and provide technical reports as required by the Government (up to one quarterly and a final).

The contract will require an extensive comparison of the ongoing clinical trial study, which will cover the activities above.  We anticipate subcontracting opportunities during the course of this contract.  For instance, there will be a need to establish an ECG Reading Center and a Laboratory Center.
 
This notice of intent expires 45-days from its posting. This is not a request for proposals (RFP). The estimated award date is September 30, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants. Any interested parties in this or potential subcontracting opportunities may contact either Paul D. McFarlane, Contract Specialist, pm24v@nih.gov, 301-435-0345 or Cheryl A. Jennings, Contracting Officer, cj19f@nih.gov, 301-435-0347.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) requires commercial, off-the-shelf, CST Studio Suite and Microstripes software that is proprietary to CST of America Inc at 10 Laurel Ave Ste 300 Wellesley MA 02481-7537.  In accord with the circumstances defined at FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to award a firm fixed-price order for the required software, non-competitively, to CST of America Inc.  
The requirement includes (1) quantity 1 each CST Studio Suite, node locked, with subscription to 1 year of maintenance, (2) qty 1 each CST Microstripes for the CST Studio Suite, node locked, and (2) quantity 80 hours of consultation from CST relative to the software and particularly the topside analysis methodologies utilizing the Transmission Line Matrix 3D solver.
Non-competitive award is based on unique features of the software.  (1) CST's Studio Suite I-Solver utilizes the MLFMM (Multi Level Fast Multipole Method), and while it is not the only CEM (Computational ElectroMagnetic) software to use this method, it is unique in having the Iterative ability.  CST I-Solver is also unique in the ability to "link" simulation with sources from other tools, the macro/VBA ability, and the ability to import and "heal" geometry within the GUI. A CST I-Solver simulation can also be directly linked to CST MICROSTRIPES simulation.  (2) CST MICROSTRIPES utilizes the TLM (Transmission Line Method), and while it is not the only CEM (Computational ElectroMagnetic) software to use this method, the method of application is unique.  CST MICROSTRIPES is unique in the "octree" mesh and "lumping" abilities, and has unique features for modeling a compact source, compact wires and cables, thin films, ferrite tiles, and filling hollow structures with metal. A CST MICROSTRIPES simulation can also be directly linked to CST I-Solver simulation.  CST of America Inc does not employ re-sellers to market CST software products.  
Questions and responses should be submitted, in Microsoft Word format, no later than __2 July 2009__ to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@NAVY.MIL and should reference this sources sought number: N00178-08-Q-3114.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY.  The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified general contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220.  The size standard is $33.5 million per year.  This is an unrestricted procurement open to all large and small business concerns.  

All firms shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letter head.  This letter shall include a statement of interest, number of personnel that will attend the Pre-proposal conference and a signed Document Security Certification (uploaded on FedBizOpps) with a copy of a valid business license.  Letters and certification are due to the office of the Contract Specialist no later than April 20, 2009.  Send documentation to the attention of Marsha Tyson, Contract Specialist, General Services Administration (GSA), (7PMA), Room 12B01, 819 Taylor St., Fort Worth, Texas 76102 or marsha.tyson@gsa.gov.  GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.).  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $40,000,000 to $50,000,000.   Funds allocated via www.recovery.gov reflect funds for the entire project and not just construction.  Contractors should price according to the construction specifications.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about April 27, 2009 via FedTeds (https://www.fedteds.gov/).  Firms must send the letter of intent with the security certification to gain access to the documents.  A Site Visit and Pre-Proposal Conference is tentatively scheduled to be held May 6 - 7, 2009 in San Antonio, Texas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the project, specifications, drawings and technical evaluation criteria.  Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference and site visit is not mandatory.  GSA intends to contract for complete construction services with the construction contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The project for this building will include replacing the HVAC system to improve energy efficiency, modernize the building electrical and fire protection systems, including the construction of a new exterior fire stair, construct new space finishes for several tenants prior to move-in, and alter interior spaces for existing tenants and renovate public spaces with focus on historic preservation, handicap access, and upgrades to the elevators and building security systems.  Additional project work will consist of extensive restroom plumbing, refurbishing of the limestone exterior, and re-roofing.


The project is designed to comply with a Certification Level according to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED), Silver Level Rating System.  The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value/Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price.  The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire construction project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project.  The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government.  Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s).  The technical factors are tentatively as follows: (#1) Past Performance and Experience on Similar Historical Projects; (#2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel; and (#3) Detailed Management Plan and Technical Approach.  Proposals will be due on or about June 2, 2009.  All questions/clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contract Specialist no later than close of business May 18, 2009.  Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror.  

This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 52.219-19). This procurement is open to small and large business concerns.  Before award of the contract, the business concern (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507. Small, women-owned, service disabled veteran owned and small disadvantaged firms are strongly encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  All interested large business firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and disadvantaged firms as indicated FAR 19.702.  The Subcontracting Goals established for this project are as follows:  Total Small Business 36%; Total Small Disadvantaged Business 8%; Woman Owned 5%; HUBZone Business 3%; and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 3%. 

All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number GS-07P-09-HH-C-0063.  This project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009.  THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE.

OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Abingdon, Maryland

This is a notice of intent for the Federal Government to solicit space in Abingdon, Maryland.  The Government anticipates negotiating a lease extension at the existing location, which currently provides 7,564 usable square feet of contiguous office. Parking for the handicapped must be located within the same block, visitor parking facilities available within two blocks of the office. Parking for employees should be available within two blocks of the office. Offeror must provide proof of a frequent bus stop within two blocks of the proposed space.

In making such a determination, the Government will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, agency mission requirements, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.  Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, and a fitness center, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors is also necessary.  Other factors impacting the Governments rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.

Space must be ready for occupancy on October 14, 2009, or sooner.  A lease term of 2-years with 90 day termination rights is sought.

<DESC>Requirement:  

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Portland, ME, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 12,078 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield approximately 10,503 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for 10 years, 7 years firm.  The space must be available for occupancy by October 1st, 2010.  The delineated area is within the city limits of Portland, ME.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey, Pacific Islands Water Science Center, intends to award a non-competitive purchase order to EcoAnalysts, Inc. of Moscow, Idaho for identification and enumeration of benthic macroinvertebrate samples to be collected from streams in Hawaii.  This service is for a base period of 120 samples from date of award through 31 March 2010, with option period of 40 samples from 01 April 2010 through 31 March 2011.  Benthic stream macroinvertebrate samples are to be collected from streams on Maui, Hawaii as part of project number 9689DRM - "Development of a Benthic Macroinvertebrate Index of Stream Quality for Hawaiian Streams."  These samples need to be processed according to the Wadeable Stream Assessment (WSA) protocols outlined in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Report EPA 841-B-04-007 (USEPA, 2004).  It is imperative that these samples are processed under the prescribed quality assurance and in a timely manner to facilitate the completion of the project.  It is also important that the samples are sorted, identified, and enumerated in a manner consistent with previous USGS benthic macroinvertebrate work in Hawaii.
EcoAnalysts has previously sorted and identified over four hundred samples for the EMAP-West WSA program.  EcoAnalysts, Inc. is familiar with the particularly unique taxonomy of Hawaiian stream benthic macroinvertebrates.  Because of the unique taxonomy of Hawaiian streams, it is critical for quality assurance purposes that the same laboratory be used when developing a benthic macroinvertebrate index of stream quality.  The benthic macroinvertebrate index of stream quality for Hawaiian streams will be developed using samples collected on Maui as part this acquisition and samples that were previously collected on Oahu and analyzed by EcoAnalysts, Inc.   Laboratory continuity is essential.  
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled, "Acquisition of Commercial Items."  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(13)(i), other responsible sources that believe they can meet the requirement described above may submit a capability statement or quotation no later than the closing date of this announcement which will be considered by the USGS.
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-33, effective 15 June 2009. 
For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer by email at sklingler@usgs.gov .

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Fisheries Research Center is requesting proposals from marine engineering firms to develop new methods for treating emergency/high risk ballast water discharges to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.  This project will begin by August of 2009.
Ballast water is the primary pathway for aquatic invasive species (AIS) introduction and spread to the Great Lakes and Lake Superior.  At least one new invasive species is found in the Great Lakes each year.  Many ballast water treatment technologies are currently undergoing research, development and various regulatory approvals.  International, national and state laws are being established to mandate the use of ballast treatment; however it will be many years before effective ballast treatment devices are available or required for all vessels.  Lake Superior will remain at risk for new AIS for many years unless simple cost effective emergency treatment is developed, especially for high risk vessels.  High risk vessels include those that frequent Great Lakes ports with known infestations or active outbreaks of AIS.  For example, viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) has not been found in Lake Superior, but ships that take up ballast water in areas where there is an outbreak of VHS and then discharge untreated ballast water into Lake Superior pose a high risk.  Development of methods to treat ballast water in high risk vessels would substantially reduce the risk of spreading VHS and other AIS to Lake Superior.  Additional details will be available in the request for quotation (RFQ).        
The Request for Quotations, number 09WRQQ0142, will be made available through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about 08 July 2009, IAW Far 5.102(a)(1).  All firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at www.ccr.gov, as well as, the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) to be considered for award.  Interested parties should contact the Contracting Officer in writing by email at sklingler@usgs.gov.  
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-33, effective 15 June 2009.

<p>Egypt - Positive Train Control System Feasibility Study.</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a Positive Train Control System.</p>
<p>The Egyptian railway sector plays a significant role in the economy. It is a critical mode of transport for lower income Egyptians and consists of 5,085 km of track, concentrated in the Nile Delta and Nile Valley. Egyptian National Railways (ENR) is the government entity within the Ministry of Transport charged with providing rail services and managing railway infrastructure in Egypt. ENR is predominantly a passenger railway conducting large scale operations in excess of 68 billion traffic units in 2007.</p>
<p>In 2006, a series of mass casualty rail accidents in Egypt caused significant public criticism of the government. In response, the government has provided ENR with increased funds to perform essential investments to remedy critical safety problems. Improving safety, increasing capacity on high density lines, increasing freight traffic and reducing capital investment and maintenance expenditures are strategic challenges faced by ENR.</p>
<p>The proposed PTC feasibility study will improve the capacity and safety of the rail system in Egypt. ENR is faced with aging and obsolete infrastructure and equipment and current operations are conducted largely by mechanical and manual procedures, which have proven unsafe, costly and inefficient. The proposed study will serve to introduce the capabilities and functionality of PTC to a wide audience of ENR and Ministry of Transport officials and technical experts. PTC is a critical safety system and a major investment, and a successful study will enable ENR to implement a full PTC system in Egypt.</p>
<p>The study will evaluate the capability of PTC technologies and systems to improve safety of operations on the Egyptian railways; improve capacity of the ENR network to operate more traffic over existing infrastructure, and; optimize ENR's operations including management of trains and adaptation to contingencies in real-time. The study will also develop preliminary performance requirements and specification for a pilot project and a full implementation of PTC technologies and systems in Egypt.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $658,323 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00pm noon, September 10, 2009 at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<a href="mailto:richard.macklin2@va.gov">Contracting Officer Richard Macklin</a>
<DESC>1. Title of Project:  Automated Reporting and Workflow system for Enterprise Denial Management (EDMP)2. Background:  The Veterans Health Administration's  (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO) is responsible for developing a denial management system to 1) identify, 2) monitor and 3) assist in the processing of primary and secondary claims that are                  denied payment.  Third-party denials are the number-one cause for non-payment and/or underpayment.   Until recently, providers did not have the ability to identify, report or process denials on a consistent basis because insurance companies use different adjudication systems and payment reporting techniques.  With the advent of Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the ASC X12N 835 for Health Care Claim Payment/Remitance Advice, providers have the ability to capture and organize denial information in a systemic fashion.  Utilizing technology enables providers to better identify root causes for denials, accelerate the resubmission of denied claims and eventually reduce the amount of revenue written-off as a result of timely filing, medical necessity and eligibility related denials.  At this time, the CBO is interested in moving towards identifying supporting solutions for 1) identifying, 2) monitoring, and 3) reworking denied claims.3.  Scope of Work:  The system will capture third-party Explanation of Benefits (EOBs) (and/or remittance advices) that are received electronically using the HIPAA ASC X12N 835 format.  By capturing and analyzing 835 transactions, the technology component will translate complex data structures into meaningful business reports by payer, denial category, denial type and source of denial within a provider or provider department.  The system will also provide for distributed reporting capability and security among multi-users; provide reporting flexibility at both a summary and detail level to include sorting and parsing of data by the end user; support the importing of user data into multiple packages (e.g. excel, acrobat, etc.); generate reports by health plan to allow for payer performance analysis and provide user defined database fields.In addition, CBO requires Contractor services that provide the use of their technology, classroom instruction in the use of system output, and support for the use of such technology by multiple users and multiple organizational levels.  Training should enable the VHA staff to produce reports, utilize workflow tools and have a thorough understanding of the specific HIPAA ASC X12N 835 standards, terms and data elements.  CBO requires system follow up support including:	Telephone and modem support to answer coding questions and resolve technical problemsRevisions and system updates should be supplied on a timely basis to stay current with industry standards.  Such program modifications may include, but not be limited to, third-party revisions to Medicare and non-Medicare denial categories.  4. Performance Period: The period of performance (POP) shall be from date of award for a period of 12 months.   5.	Type of Contract:  Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Task Order

<p><br />Description<br />The U.S. Air Force submits a Request for Information (RFI) for industry-wide assistance in identifying potential concepts/solutions for the Air Force's full spectrum of combat support capabilities. The Air Forces's Agile Combat Support (ACS) Modernization Analysis Working Group (MAWG) is interested in obtaining information from industry, academia, and Government Laboratories for concepts/solutions, as well as enabling and critical R&amp;D innovative technologies and approaches that offer the potential to enhance the Air Force's ability to provide combat support across the full range of military operations. The MAWG is preparing to conduct the Solutions Recommendation Phase of the ACS Capability Based Assessment (CBA) for FY-12 POM input (see Attach 3_ACS_CBA). ACS is comprised of equipment and systems that are applied in support of all Air Force operations. There is an immediate need to safely and efficiently create, protect, and sustain air and space forces across the range of military operations with lighter weight, smaller footprint, reduced number of combat support resources to achieve a more rapidly deployable capability. These mandates require the more efficient application of combat support resources, equipment, and concepts, via enabling technologies to provide and support a broad spectrum of combat support capabilities. The ACS Concept of Operations identifies more than 20 functional areas comprising the ACS mission area (see Attach 4_ACS Factsheet). This RFI seeks potential concepts and solutions for the following functional areas: Air Traffic Control and Airfield Management, Chaplain, Civil Engineer, Communications and Information, Contracting, Financial Management and Comptroller, Historian, Judge Advocate, Logistics Planning, Maintenance and Munitions, Manpower, Medical, Military Equal Opportunity, Personnel, Postal Services, Protocol, Public Affairs, Safety, Security Forces, Base Services, Supply, and Transportation. To be considered a viable concept, submissions must apply to one or more ACS capabilities. A list of focus areas is provided in a subsequent amendment under the same tracking number as this special notice. Limitations in combat support capabilities across the full range of military operations restrict operational prerogatives. Initial forces often arrive with minimal support and resources. Size and/or weight of ACS equipment and systems strain limited airlift or sealift. Innovative solutions potentially serve to offset these constraints. Present combat support resources are being consumed by current operations, are aging, and are quickly becoming technically obsolete. Information on systems and solutions that require less inter-theater airlift and fewer personnel to support, erect, and maintain operations is requested. Solutions that reduce personnel requirements and logistical footprints while enhancing force protection, infrastructure, and agile logistics are of particular interest. Viable concepts/solutions shall include those that are projected to mature within the following timeframes: Near-term (2012-2017), Mid-term (2018-2023), Far-term (2024-2030). All viable concepts will be reviewed in the ongoing ACS CBA (see Attach 3_ACS_CBA). Solution data should provide sufficient detail regarding processes, technologies, approaches and capabilities for the Government to meaningfully assess the solution's viability, risk, scope of development and procurement costs as well as correlation to the ACS capability topics listed under amendment one. Submission of solutions under this RFI will require the use of one of two Solution Data Input Workbook Templates provided as attachments to this RFI using the same tracking number. Industry respondents should use the "Industry Solution Data Input Workbook" Template (see Attach 1_ACS_Industry Solution Data Input Workbook_v0_20May09) and Government respondents should use the "Government Solution Data Input Workbook" Template (see Attach 2_ACS_Govt Solution Data Input Workbook_v0_20May09). Each solution shall provide sufficient detail, not to exceed 3 pages, to facilitate solution understanding. The template format shall be followed in order for a concept submission to be considered responsive. Each response must be received at ACC/A8MC, no later than close of business 31 July 2009 in order for it to be considered. Again, the responses received must use the same tracking number as the RFI to ensure positive tracking. Data submissions must be delivered via Email (using the MS Word template file provided), or a PDF Formatted attachment, or via authorized delivery means for documents authorized under DOD procedures. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. Mark all proprietary information "For Government Use Only." Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. MAWG government representatives from across the US Air Force will technically score all responsive concept submissions. This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes. This announcement does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer which could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award any contract on the sole basis of this special notice, nor shall the US Government otherwise pay for any information solicited or administrative costs incurred under this announcement.

<DESC><p>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<br />---------------<br />A. General Information
<p>Heartland-Region 5 seeks to initiate a standardization process for Pads and Wipes under the Regional Standardization Program. The primary objective of the program is to standardize the quality of care across this region, based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. The seven facilities in the region include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox, Kentucky, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Naval Hospital Corps School Great Lakes Illinois, and USCG Air Station Traverse City, Michigan. Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative.</p>
<p>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFQ). Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, will be disqualified in Phase I. This product line includes but is not limited to the following Pads and Wipes listed in the Technical Criteria.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Regions current PV Owens &amp; Minor. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement to the PV Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is October 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<br />Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>B. Products and Performance Required<br />The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Pads and Wipes, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $38,759.02. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top-six (6) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. At the request of the Heartland Regional MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<br />The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their "intent to participate" to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:<br />1. Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of Pads and Wipes. At a minimum, the line must include alcohol, povidone-iodine, witch hazel, benzalkonium chloride, adhesive remover, nail polish remover, baby wipes and any other products in this category. <br />2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. This list should include the types of skin pads, towelettes; swab sticks, and wipes your company manufactures. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />3. In response to this RFQ, vendors must provide a statement confirming their products are manufactured according to FDA, GMP, and USP requirements.<br />4. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Pads and Wipes product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<br />5. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Heartland Region, Owens &amp; Minor, for distribution in the Heartland Region. In response to this RFQ please provide your 4-digit Owens &amp; Minor Code. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) <br />6. Vendors must provide their 4-Digit Prime Vendor Number in response to this RFQ. If unknown, contact Owens and Minor.<br />7. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />8. Vendors MUST provide latex free Pads &amp; Wipes. Pads &amp; Wipes must be clearly marked as "Latex-free" Vendors MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal<br />9. In response to this RFQ please provide the brand(s) under which your company manufactures or distributes your products. <br />10. In response to this RFQ please provide the active ingredients contained in the different types of skin pads, towelettes, swab sticks, and wipes.<br />11. In response to this RFQ please provide information that your skin pads, towelettes, swab sticks, and wipes do not have perfumes or substances that may be irritating to the skin or cause allergic reactions.<br />12. In response to this RFQ please provide the germicidal activity as appropriate for your skin pads, towelettes, swab sticks, and wipes.<br />13. In response to this RFQ please provide if your Pads &amp; Wipes are appropriate for use with adult, pediatric and neonatal populations.<br />14. In response to this RFQ please provide information that your Pads &amp; Wipes are low-lint or lint-free.<br />15. In response to this RFQ please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents. If your company has not had any of the above, so state.</p>
<p>Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient-care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors' average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors' average scores). In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold. Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />1. (Staff Efficiency of Care/ Patient Safety) The packaging is easy to open without compromising sterility.<br />a. Clinicians require packaging that allows for easy opening without compromising sterility to prevent introducing bacteria to the skin surface.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.<br />c. Evaluator will open/remove product from packaging without contaminating and apply to patient skin. Evaluator will observe the ease of performing the task.<br />2. (Patient Safety) The product does not leave lint behind.<br />a. Clinicians require that the product not leave lint behind on the skin to prevent fibers from entering the body during procedures.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.<br />c. After cleansing the patients' skin, the evaluator will examine the skin and visualize if lint was left on the skin.<br />3. (Patient Safety) The product effectively cleanses the skin.<br />a. Clinicians require that the product effectively cleanse the skin to remove dirt, debris and bacteria.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.<br />c. The evaluator will examine the patient's skin with the naked eye and determine if there is any dirt and/or debris on the skin. After the evaluator cleanses the skin, the evaluator will re-examine the skin with the naked eye and verify the skin is clear of dirt and debris.<br />4. (Patient Safety) The product is non-irritating.<br />a. Clinicians require that product not be irritating to the skin to prevent damage to the skin or allergic reactions.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.<br />The evaluator will observe the condition of the patient skin before cleansing with the product and after the product has dried for compromise to skin integrity.<br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) to include analysis to determine cost savings, if any, relative to historical spending.<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?); and<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)
<p><br />Issued By</p>
<p>The Office of General Counsel, Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will take procurement action in this matter. Further, neither the FBI nor the Government will be responsible for costs incurred by any respondent in furnishing this information. This RFI is not restricted and intends to assess the capabilities of all businesses in performing the described tasks.</p>
<p>This RFI is designed to gather information and comments from U.S. law firms regarding a proposed procurement for legal services. The request for information and comments stems from the FBI's interest in surveying all federal and state environmental and health and safety laws applicable to firearms training facilities operated or used by the FBI in the United States and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. The FBI will use the results of this RFI to determine the interest and capability of responding law firms and to refine the scope of a potential solicitation for legal services. The FBI anticipates that any solicitation will be premised on a firm fixed-price contract and awarded to the offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The FBI Office of Integrity and Compliance (OIC) implements the Bureau's Integrity and Compliance program, an internal enterprise-wide mechanism designed to promote the FBI's compliance with applicable laws, regulations and other governing authorities. Pursuant to this program, the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) and the OIC identified compliance with environmental and safety and health laws at firearms training facilities operated or used by the FBI as an area of potential legal risk, warranting a detailed legal compliance analysis.</p>
<p>The FBI has over 30,000 employees, of whom approximately 42% (special agents and police officers) carry firearms. To carry a firearm, these employees must "qualify" four times a year with their firearms. Special agents and FBI police officers qualify by receiving firearms training at a variety of firearms training facilities throughout the United States and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. <br />In one instance, the FBI owns, operates, and uses the range facility. In all other instances, the firearms training facilities the FBI uses are owned and/or operated by a variety of federal government agencies, state or local government agencies or, in a few cases, private entities. There are some locations where the FBI is the exclusive or joint operator of a facility; in the majority of instances, however, the FBI merely uses a facility owned and operated by others. The FBI's arrangement with each facility is often, but not always, governed by a memorandum of understanding, memorandum of agreement, or other written agreement vehicle. <br />Although the FBI is simply a mere user at the majority of firearms training facilities, it must comply with federal environmental laws applicable to the use of these facilities. These laws relate to the discharge, transportation, recycling, storage, and disposal of lead used at the facilities. In addition, federal law permits the states to implement and enforce environmental laws as long as those laws are as stringent as or broader in scope than the federal laws and regulations. Therefore, the FBI must understand and comply with applicable state and local law. <br />The FBI must also comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970, relating to the safety and health of FBI employees who use the training facilities. In particular, these employees must be protected from the potential inhalation and ingestion of lead. <br />The scope of work for the anticipated procurement will be limited to a review and written analysis of the legal framework relevant to the FBI's operation and use of firearms training facilities in the context of environmental and safety and health laws. The successful bidder might also be requested to provide one or more oral presentations of its findings and conclusions to the Office of General Counsel and the Office of Integrity and Compliance at FBI Headquarters. <br />The FBI expects to solicit legal services requiring each bidder to demonstrate its ability to provide the following deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Review all federal environmental and safety and health statutes, regulations, executive orders, and policies relevant to the operation or use by non-owners of firearms training facilities including, but not limited to, the applicability of:<br />a. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. ' 9601 et seq., and its implementing regulations found at 40 C.F.R. Parts 300-374; <br />b. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. ' 6901 et seq., and its implementing regulations found at 40 C.F.R. Parts 239-299; <br />c. The Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. U.S.C. ' 1251 et seq.; <br />d. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970, 29 U.S.C. &sect;651 et seq.;<br />e. The requirements imposed by the Department of Defense ("DOD") related to firearms training facilities owned by DOD and operated or used by the FBI; and<br />f. The requirements, if any, imposed by the General Services Administration ("GSA") related to the operation or use of firearms facilities located in or on the grounds of GSA properties leased to federal government agencies. <br />2. Review all state environmental and safety and health statutes, regulations, executive orders, and policies relevant to the operation or use by federal agencies of firearms training facilities owned by other entities.<br />3. Examine whether the FBI could be held liable for mere use of a firearms training facility in jurisdictions where it uses a facility owned and operated by others. If liability can be imposed in some jurisdictions and not others, highlight the jurisdictions in which liability may arise. <br />4. Analyze the factors which would affect the potential liability of an operator or user including, but not limited to:<br />a. Physical attributes of range;<br />b. Proximity to "navigable waters," such as ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, and coastal waters, as defined by the Clean Water Act and interpreted by the courts;<br />c. Proximity to public spaces, including parks and schools;<br />d. Proximity to environmentally sensitive or protected areas;<br />e. Noise decibel;<br />f. Previous facility contamination;<br />g. Frequency of use;<br />h. Dust control, protective clothing, and safe work practices; and <br />i. Record-keeping practices.<br />5. Answer the following questions:<br />a. What environmental and safety and health responsibilities does the FBI have when it operates or uses a firearms training facility owned by another federal agency, a state or local agency, or a private entity?<br />b. What environmental and safety and health responsibilities does the FBI have when it merely uses a facility it neither owns nor operates?<br />c. Are there other legal issues, including property, contractual, or regulatory, which attend the FBI's operation and use of firearms training facilities?<br />d. Are there other legal issues, including property, contractual, or regulatory, which attend the FBI's mere use of firearms training facilities?<br />6. Analyze trends in federal and state litigation over the past 15 years:<br />a. Has there been an increase in litigation alleging violations of environmental or safety and health laws at firearms training facilities, including private facilities?<br />b. Are the majority of cases brought by individual plaintiffs or styled as class actions? If the latter, what are the characteristics of a typical class?<br />c. Who are the typical defendants? Are operators and users often joined if they are not the owners of the facilities? Are users often named if they are not owners or operators of facilities?<br />d. Have most plaintiffs invoked state and local laws as well as federal laws? <br />e. Have the cases been evenly distributed throughout the U.S. or have they been more concentrated in certain geographic areas? If so, which areas?<br />f. What percentage of cases has been appealed on the merits (i.e. not standing issues or other procedural or jurisdictional issues)? <br />g. Is there a trend of third parties filing amicus briefs? If so, who are the typical amici?<br />h. Is there a trend of courts finding firing range facility owners, operators, or users liable for violations of environmental or safety and health laws? <br />i. Looking outside the firing range context, has there been a trend of courts finding "arranger liability" or other bases for liability arising out of violations of environmental or safety and health laws attributable to a mere user of a facility? If so, what factors did the courts consider compelling in such determinations?<br />7. Compile a list of all reported cases involving allegations of environmental or safety and health law violations at firearms training facilities in federal or state court in the last 15 years. Include the caption of the case, docket number, and jurisdiction.<br />8. Compile a list of all complaints filed involving allegations of environmental or safety and health law violations at firearms training facilities in federal or state court in the last ten years. Include the style of the case, docket number, and jurisdiction.<br />9. Determine whether there are environmental licensing requirements for the use of firearms training facilities, including documentation and filing with state/federal authorities. Among other possible requirements, must the FBI obtain its own National Permit Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for ranges it operates or uses where the lead is discharged into "navigable waters" under the Clean Water Act?</p>

<DESC>1.0  INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this Sources Sought is to seek information on how an interested contractor could provide area chaff dispensing capability to carrier based aircraft.

The results of this Sources Sought will be utilized to define Area Chaff Dispenser alternatives in support of POM-12 budget submission to initiate a Program of Record (POR).

2.0  DISCLAIMER

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR A PROMISE TO ISSUE A RFP IN THE FUTURE.  FURTHER, THE NAVY IS NOT AT THIS TIME SEEKING PROPOSALS AND WILL NOT ACCEPT UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS.  IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THERE ARE NO FUNDS AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

3.0  REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

3.1  Background
The ALE-43 chaff dispensing pod was originally developed for training purposes in the mid-1980s for use by the Fleet Electronic Warfare Support Group (FEWSG). Since then, an operational use for area chaff was realized. Presently, there is an insufficient quantity of ALE-43 pods in existence to support both the Navy and Marine Corps operations. 

The ALE-43 pods are over 20 years old and were not originally designed for carrier based operations. Some of the pods were structurally modified and carrier suited on the EA-6B; however, the Navy will be completely divested of the carrier based EA-6B by the end of FY 2012. The F/A-18C/D Hornet is also cleared to carry the ALE-43 but the flight envelope is limited and they do not currently have a flight clearance for carrier operations.  Carriage of the ALE-43 on Super Hornet and Growler platforms (F/A-18E/F and EA-18G) is estimated to be an equivalent level of effort as a new production area chaff dispenser solution and would not alone solve availability needs. 

Combatant Commanders have recently emphasized their continued need for area chaff capability in operational scenarios.  

3.2	Program Objectives
In order to make an informed acquisition decision regarding implementation of a dispensing capability for area chaff, a study of area chaff dispensing alternatives to meet an impending area chaff capability gap is being initiated. Potential alternatives should include, but are not limited to:
	Integrate and carrier suit ALE-43 on F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler
	Repackage ALE-43 components into an existing shape that is already certified to be carried by the Super Hornet/Growler, i.e. drop tank, etc
	Develop new dispensing system into an existing shape that is already certified to be carried by the Super Hornet/Growler
	Develop new dispensing system

Alternatives provided will aid in development of a POM-12 budget submission to initiate a Program of Record (POR).  Alternatives should:
	Address fundamental ALE-43 shortfalls/performance requirements
- Limited scalability, flexibility, supportability
- Limited interoperability, availability
	Implement mature technologies to reduce program risk
	Invoke a modular, scalable, open system architecture to ensure future growth and platform adaptability
	Be an effective, integrated, and affordable Area Chaff Dispensing system with a projected Initial Operational Capability (IOC) that would either prevent or diminish any capability gap realized due to the Navys EA-6B sundown plan

3.3	 Potential Development Approach
Responses should show the relevancy of the design solution in demonstrating technology maturity sufficient to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase by 2012.  Interested contractors should show that they possess the in-house breadth of experience and expertise to not only design the Area Chaff Dispenser, but also implement follow-on phases of development such as EMD and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). 

In addition to concerns previously discussed, Area Chaff Dispenser design responses should address the following issues of design and programmatics:
	Outline of schedule and tasks for Technology Development (TD), EMD and LRIP Phases with sufficient detail to conduct comparative analysis, include a listing assumptions and perceived levels of risk and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimates
	Physical Description, including dimensions, and interfaces such as weight, size,  aircraft mounting, power requirements and data exchanges
	Method of improving operational flexibility through control and status exchange between the operator and the dispenser to include discussion of impacts to carriage aircraft Operational Flight Programs (OFP) or schemes for emulation of existing stores interfaces 
	Form factor of chaff rovings (including any deviations from RR-179/AL rovings)
	Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) requirements and impact to existing carrier outfitting
	Ground Support Equipment (GSE) common fielded equipment utilized for dispenser handling, loading, testing, etc
	Mission Planning tools to include any provisions for post-mission analysis
	Design for carrier suitability including all aspects of Logistic Support associated with seaborne operations
	Manpower and Facilities impacts where the design may add new skill sets or facilities required for support

4.0  NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS)

The applicable Product Service Code (PSC) is AC12 and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  The NAICS Code is matched to size standards that are expressed as revenue (in millions of dollars) for companies providing services or expressed in number of employees for companies engaged in manufacturing. The size standard is 1,500 employees.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is expanding the radar capabilities at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF). This involves the addition of a remote balloon launching facility at our North Slope of Alaska (NSA), Barrow, Research Site. This facility will enable radio sonde launches to take place on a regular schedule with little impact from severe local weather conditions that can at times cause launches to be canceled because operators are unable to reach the site.</p>
<p>Performing balloon launches on a regular schedule in arctic climates can become a difficult, time consuming, even dangerous occupation. At the NSA site, access roads can easily become closed by blizzard conditions and cold temperatures can compromise the integrity of a launch. In order to maintain a set launch schedule it may be necessary to keep personnel on-site well beyond their normal working hours. The desire to increase the number of daily BBSS operations can make this effort extremely expensive. The implementation of a remote balloon launching facility that can launch a considerable number of balloons on a regular schedule unattended will allow for long-range cost savings and a safer operating environment.</p>
<p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide a remote balloon launcher in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill and launch radiosonde balloons (up to 800 g in size) with attached radiosondes automatically<br />&bull; Capable of performing at least 24 consecutive launches without attendance, including balloon filling (helium) and ground check procedures associated with the Vaisala Digicora radiosonde system<br />&bull; Provides storage location for helium<br />&bull; Capable of operating in extreme weather conditions, including high winds, blizzard conditions, extreme cold (-40 C)<br />&bull; Heated shelter for preconditioning/preparing balloons at 1-2 wk intervals<br />&bull; Ability to control and monitor launch schedule remotely<br />&bull; Capable of arbitrary, changeable launch schedule<br />&bull; Has a NIST traceable surface weather station for ground comparison</p>
<p>Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:<br />1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.<br />2) Brochures providing descriptions of equipment, maintenance and standard warranty, along with a current published commercial pricelist.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Battelle does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Please provide your expression of interest to the attention of the points of contact listed below.</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional information, they must also be submitted in writing to the points of contact.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR>The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of MEDICATION CONTAINERS.     <BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to, Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is September 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast region, the government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  Point of Contact:  Virginia Slayton, (706) 787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of MEDICATION CONTAINERS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $476,137.00.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Virginia Slayton, (706) 787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EDT on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EDT on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to VIRGINIA.SLAYTON@US.ARMY.MIL by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  <BR><BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Medication Container products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.	At a minimum the vendor must provide the following:  Medication Vials; amber, in sizes ranging from 11 - 60 dram, with child resistant and non-child resistant caps to fit the appropriate vials.  Medication Bottles; clear and amber, in sizes ranging from 75cc - 175 cc, with child resistant and non-child resistant caps to fit the appropriate bottles. Medication Jars; available in sizes ranging from one (1) ounce to eight (8) ounces, with lids to fit the appropriate jars. <BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via excel sheet, and product catalog & literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Medication Containers product line.  Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the Med/Surg prime vendor in the Southeast Region for Medication Containers (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor).  Vendor MUST provide prime vendor conversion number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Southeast Region PV (Owens & Minor) will be disqualified in Phase I.)  <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Note vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide Latex Free/Safe Medication Containers.  Vendor MUST identify all Latex Free/Safe Medication Containers in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Note vendors who cannot provide Latex Free/Safe Medication Containers will be disqualified in Phase I.  <BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) attention at the participating Medical Treatment Facilities and will be allowed fourteen (14) calendar days from the of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the Medical Treatment Facilities by COB, 5:00 PM EDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.<BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	Vendor will provide no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation.  Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  (Unused samples will not be returned).  Vendors WILL NOT be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS.  <BR>5.	To determine acceptability, the Clinical Product Team (CPT), comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.	(Patient Safety) The medication vial/cap combination is durable.<BR>a.	The pharmaceutical vial/cap combination must be able to withstand normal wear and tear encountered from filling the prescription to daily usage by the patient (US Pharmacopeia General Notices and Requirements - 10.20.30.  Well-Closed Container and 10.20.40. Tight Container &protects the contents from contamination by extraneous liquids, solids, or vapors; from loss of the article&).<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by technician/clinician assessment when handling the vial/cap during normal usage.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety/Comfort) The quality of the cap seal is sufficient to prevent accidental/unintentional opening of the vial.<BR>a.	The medication vial must remain securely closed to provide containment of the                 medication until access is required. (US Pharmacopeia General Notices and Requirements - 10.20.30.  Well-Closed Container and 10.20.40. Tight Container                &protects the contents from contamination by extraneous liquids, solids, or vapors; from loss of the article&)<BR>b.	To accomplish the evaluation of this criterion, the technician/clinician will fill the vial, place the cap on the vial, and shake the vial.<BR>3.	(Patient Safety) The exterior surface of the vial provides for secure adherence of a label.<BR>a.	Correct identification of the contained medication form the label on the vial is essential to patient safety. (National Patient Safety Goal #3, Improve the safety of using medications. NPSG. 03.04.01; Label all medications, medication containers (for example, syringes, medicine cups, basins), or other solutions on and off the sterile field.<BR>b.	The technician/clinician will evaluate this criterion by applying a standard medication label utilized by the facility to the vial and attempting to remove it.  <BR>4.	(Patient Safety) The Medication Bottle is durable and the lid provides a satisfactory, secure seal.<BR>a.	The bottle must be able to withstand normal wear and tear encountered from filling the prescription to daily usage by the patient. (US Pharmacopeia General Notices and Requirements - 10.20.30.  Well-Closed Container and 10.20.40. Tight Container &protects the contents from contamination by extraneous liquids, solids, or vapors; from loss of the article&)<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by technician/clinician assessment when handling the vial/cap during normal usage.<BR>5.	(Patient Safety) The Medication Jar is durable and the lid provides a satisfactory, secure seal.<BR>a.	The jar must be able to withstand normal wear and tear encountered from filling the                 prescription to daily usage by the patient. (US Pharmacopeia General Notices and                 Requirements - 10.20.30.  Well-Closed Container and 10.20.40. Tight Container                 &protects the contents from contamination by extraneous liquids, solids, or vapors; from loss of the article&)<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by technician/clinician assessment when handling the vial/cap during normal usage.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EDT), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>	<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) period from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast Region, (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Southeast Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Southeast Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (3) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Southeast Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 22 JULY 2009 5:00 PM EDT.<BR>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate a contract with Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
<p>This procurement is for a contract with Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, to collect and store tissue samples from patients in the cluster area with myeloproliferative disorders (polycythemia vera (PV), idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). Specimens from other individuals in the cluster area with potential or suspected environmental exposures may be included. This would include any specimens collected from cluster-area PV patients prior to the formal establishment of this contract. Specimens from other individuals in the cluster area with potential or suspected environmental exposures may also be included. Tissue samples will be used to conduct laboratory investigations to help define mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of these disorders, possible causes of the cluster, and potential treatments. Specific requirements are:</p>
<p>1. Arrange for the collection, temporary storage, and transport of tissue specimens from the PV cluster area in eastern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>2. Make the collected tissues available for PV-related research.</p>
<p>The Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium (MPD-RC) is the only international, multi-institutional non profit consortium set up to coordinate, facilitate, and perform basic and clinical research investigating the genetic and cellular mechanisms of Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). The MPD-RC is the only organization with an established tissue bank specifically geared towards MPD research, and can thus guarantee the most effective use of tissue samples donated for research purposes.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Mount Sinai School of Medicine under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are hereby afforded the opportunity to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward product and pricing information to Diane Meeder, Contract Specialist, Procurement and Grant Branch-V (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email Dmeeder@cdc.gov.</p>
<p>All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals; however, the Government will review any/all product and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, negotiations will be conducted with Mount Sinai School of Medicine, 1 Gustave L Levy Place, New York, NY 10029-6500 as the only source.</p>

<DESC><p>Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-48: 7-Day Biodefense Proposers' Day Workshop, DATE: July 20, 2009; REGISTRATION DEADLINE: July 15, 2009; TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Michael Callahan, DARPA/DSO, Email: callahanmeeting@darpa.mil; <br />URL: www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm
<p>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a Proposers' Day Workshop for 7-Day Biodefense that will provide critical information on the program vision, the program milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team to respond to a DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), DARPA-BAA-09-43. The goal of 7-Day Biodefense is to revolutionize the speed of our response to pathogens through investments in novel technologies that will prevent infection, extend survival rates until a cure is available, provide transient immunity, and speed the onset of adaptive immunity to pathogens. DARPA seeks to develop highly innovative approaches to counter any known, unknown, naturally occurring, and engineered pathogens. This program will focus on four Technical Areas: Prevent Infection; Sustain Survival; Provide Transient Immunity; and Create Persistent Immunity. Each proposal must respond to only one of these technical areas and provide an aggressive research schedule with milestones that demonstrate a clear path to achieving the end of phase metric. There will be a Live Fire Test in Areas Three (Provide Transient Immunity) and Four (Create Persistent Immunity) to demonstrate capability against a DARPA-designated unknown biological agent in an animal model.</p>
<p>Novel approaches that obviate traditional approaches and rate-limiting steps are of particular interest (e.g. pathogen isolation, culture, identification, antigen processing by the immune system, and onset of adaptive immunity). This program is seeking pre-clinical validation only. Human clinical trials are specifically excluded. Also excluded from consideration is research that results in incremental and evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice (e.g. PAPR/MOPS, HEPA filters, ventilator/mask technologies, and use of traditional post-exposure antibiotics).</p>
<p>The 7-Day Biodefense Proposers' Day Workshop will be held at The Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Blvd, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201, 9:00am-4:30pm EST, July 20, 2009. The goals of the teaming and information session are to: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the 7-Day Biodefense program vision and goals; (b) explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort; and (c) encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the 7-Day Biodefense program goals. The teaming and information session will include overview presentations by Government personnel and poster sessions (posters presented by potential proposers) to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. Additionally, a teaming website will be provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://www.sainc.com/7DayTeaming.</p>
<p><br />Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all aspects within each technical area described in the BAA will be critical to the success of the 7-Day Biodefense program. DARPA will not be funding individual component technologies that do not fully address the technical area requirements.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions, 7-Day Biodefense Proposers' Day participants are strongly encouraged to submit a two-slide PowerPoint presentation depicting their organization's capability areas, along with a poster illustrating similar strengths for presentation during the poster session. Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are provided on the registration website at https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm (conference code: DAR65291).</p>
<p>There is no registration fee for the 7-Day Biodefense Proposers' Day Workshop. Registration is limited (maximum 100 people; 1 person per organization) by the venue capacity. The Poster Session will be limited to 1 poster per organization, with poster size limited to 3x4 square feet per poster. The registration deadline is 4:00PM ET, July 15, 2009 or until capacity is reached.</p>
<p>For any questions related to this effort please e-mail callahanmeeting@darpa.mil. Please refer to the 7-Day Biodefense Proposers' Day Workshop (DARPA-SN-09-48) in all correspondence.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned.</p>

<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-10-1001
<RESPDATE>072209
<CONTACT>Syreeta  Gay, Email SSA.HIT.Draft.RFP.Comments@ssa.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY--THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services.  Response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  The information provided may be used by the Social Security Administration in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work.  

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to exchange information with industry related to its efforts to improve the speed and quality of its Disability Determination Process.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for the Nations two primary Federal Disability Programs: Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income.  Due to the significant growth in disability applications over the last 5 years, the increased complexity of those applications, limited resources, medical advances, changing health information technology, and outdated policies, our ability to process disability applications have fallen short of our own expectations.  We request an estimated 15-20 million medical records each year from healthcare facilities (hospitals, clinics, physicians, psychologists, and other health professionals) across the country to obtain evidence of an individuals medical condition.  Providing medical records is very labor-intensive and expensive for healthcare facilities.  In addition, some facilities require the use of their own forms and some do not respond to our requests for medical records at all.  As a result, we are forced to obtain and retain paper originals of authorization forms and in some instances schedule consultative examinations when medical sources do not respond to our requests.  The current process results in significant burdens on applicants, providers, and the government.  

OBJECTIVE: While there is no single solution to improve our disability determination process; one of SSAs proposed solutions is to expand our current Medical Evidence Gathering and Analysis through Health Information Technology (MEGAHIT) project by recruiting additional health care providers and networks to automate the exchange of medical records.  Automating the solution for Release of Information will save time and money for the providers and will also make SSAs decision determination process more efficient and effective.  To achieve this goal, SSA contemplates awarding fixed price contracts to expand the number of healthcare providers participating in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN).  This will be done through a full and open, competitive, fixed-price request for proposal (RFP) contracting process.  SSA hopes to award contracts to organizations representing Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), General Medical Service Providers/Facilities and Specialty Care Providers/Facilities. This effort will be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) funds and payment will be made to awarded contractors upon successful completion of the implementation and successful response to several production requests from SSA with the transmission of verified Continuity of Care Documents (CCD).

Information submitted in response to this RFI will be used to gauge interest of healthcare providers willing to participate in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN), develop the capability to receive standardized electronic requests for medical evidence of record (MER), patient authorization and respond to requests with structured medical information through a CCD(s).  SSA will also use the RFI responses to help develop a Request for Proposal that will lead to contracts for the implementation of the MEGAHIT project.  

SSA seeks information from industry for preliminary planning purposes ONLY.  This RFI will allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the governments requirement and to affirm that there is a general understanding of the requirement.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or to award a contract.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  

A detailed description of the project is contained in the attached DRAFT RFP.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  In addition, this effort will be funded with Recovery Act funds; therefore the solicitation will contain the clauses at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-5, Alternate II, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders  Commercial Items.  Specifically, the following:

52.203-15  Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009)
52.204-11 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009)
52.215-2 Alternate I, Audit and Records-Negotiation  


Responses from industry MUST be submitted via email to SSA.HIT.Draft.RFP.Comments@ssa.gov by July 22, 2009.   No phone calls will be accepted.  The subject line of the submission should be RFI for Authorized release of Medical Information to SSA through integration with the NHIN.  Responses must include the following information: 

1. Company/Facility name, address, point of contact, phone number and email address. 

2. Type of healthcare organization (Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), General Medical Service Providers/Facilities and/or Specialty Care Providers/Facilities). 

3. Does your company use an electronic health records system?   

4. Who is your electronic health records software vendor?

5. Does your company have experience in exchanging electronic health records?  If so, with whom?

6. What additional information from the Government would you need to develop a proposal?

7. Describe the risks associated with participating in this effort (business, operational, technical) and what actions could be taken to mitigate these risks?

8. If we issue a Request for Proposals, would you submit a proposal?  If not, why?

9. Do you have any other concerns/comments or recommendations regarding the Draft RFP or proposed acquisition approach? Specifically, we seek input on the following documents:

-Statement of Work (RFP Section B-1)
-Electronic Health Records Content Checklist (RFP Section E)
-SSAs Implementation Guide (www.socialsecurity.gov/hit)
-Instructions to Offerors (RFP Section F)
-Proposed Evaluation Criteria (RFP Section G-1(d))


We emphasize that this RFI is for planning and information purposes. No solicitation exists; therefore, requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the <br />Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any<br />other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

<DESC><p>The 96th Contracting Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price contract for a portable tower. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and Subpart 13.5, As supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The announcement number is F1TBBB9155A001. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 332312 with a size standard of 500 employees. Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This is a 100% small business set aside.
<p>The technical requirements on the item are as follows:</p>
<p>A requirement exists for an enclosed portable lift platform for the purpose of elevating instrumentation used for data collection. This platform is to be configured based on descriptions and details listed in the requirement section below. The application in which this platform will be used is described as follows:<br />1) The instrumentation will be installed in the enclosed booth that will be heated or cooled depending on ambient temperature or instrument operational requirements.<br />2) The booth is mounted on a scissor type, or similar lifting mechanism, that will raise the booth to an appropriate height needed for data collection.<br />3) Prior to raising the booth, the single axle trailer outriggers will be put in place to provide stability while the platform is out of the retracted or lowered position.<br />4) The heavier equipment will be placed directly on the platform floor viewing out a port hole in each of the three sides of the booth.<br />Other equipment may be positioned to view out windows that are positioned higher on the booth sides. Personnel may be positioned with the equipment, but for the most part the tower will be raised with equipment only. The lift platform will also have an electrical power generator that will operate the lift and provide power for instrumentation. This will allow full operation of the lift and instrumentation combination when positioned at a down range or remote location for data collection purposes.<br />Requirements:</p>
<p>1) A weather tight enclosed booth on platform mounted to a single axis trailer.<br />2) The trailer will have appropriate safety lighting and connection to a towing vehicle.<br />3) The ground to platform floor height of 25 to 30 ft (platform extended).<br />4) For stability, the trailer needs to have the appropriate "outriggers" that will manually be put in place prior to lifting the platform.<br />5) There needs to be tie down points at the four corners of the platform. This will allow the platform to be secured to fixed ground tie down points for additional stability.<br />6) The retracted height (ground to highest point) should not go beyond 9'11".<br />7) Ground to platform floor height retracted should be 3 to 4 ft. This will allow heavy equipment to be easily transferred from the platform to a cart.<br />8) In addition to the weight of the booth, the platform will support &gt;500lbs.<br />9) The hitch on the trailer needs to have an adjustable stand with a wheel to allow trailer placement without vehicle.<br />10) Platform size and booth needs to be ~5ft x 8ft. The booth needs to have full (clear) access form one side or end. This will allow a cart to be positioned next to the edge of the platform (platform retracted) and equipment can be easily transferred between the two.<br />11) The door width needs to be 43" minimum. The door height can be typical.<br />12) The door needs to swing wide open (180 degrees) allowing a cart to roll as close to the platform as possible.<br />13) Steps to the platform can be easily removed allowing a cart to be rolled as close as possible to the door opening.<br />14) There needs to be 3 openings (one on each side) that are 12"x12" with an access cover. These openings need to be at the platform level (close to the floor) and centered on each of the 3 sides. The access cover can be removed prior to lifting the platform.<br />15) Six windows are needed, two on each side, on in the front and one in the door. Total window height is optional.<br />16) A single window centered on the front side. Prefer 24" wide with sill at 40" from the floor (same as the side windows). Lower half opens vertically 16". <br />17) The two windows on each of the long side. Prefer 24" wide. The horizontal center or each window should be at 32" and sill height at 40". Lower half opens vertically 16".<br />18) The door window can be fixed. Window sill at 40" from platform. The width as wide as possible for safety reasons.<br />19) AC positioned for non interference with height, equipment, and personnel. Suggest mounting it exterior to the top of the front side and protected from the weather.<br />20) Wired for 110 ac, with multiple outlets 30 amps total. The connection to the generator output can be easily disconnected allowing the use of building power.<br />21) Be able raise and lower the platform from within the booth or on the ground.<br />22) In the case of emergency, be able to lower the platform without applied power.<br />23) An audible alarm when platform is being raised or lowered.<br />24) There needs to be a safety mechanism on the doors to prevent opening when platform is raised and safety chain on the inside of the door.<br />25) A gas generator with sufficient power to run a lift pump, air conditioning, and a 30 amp internal load.<br />26) The booth to be fabricated from aluminum.<br />27) All painted surfaces white (not flat white) with exception of generator and components that don't need painting.<br />28) Removable heavy duty cover or covers (canvas tarp) for the booth and generator. The cover needs to secure to trailer frame.<br />29) If the sides are not sloped out at the top, then there needs to be sufficient overhand or drip edge to prevent water from streaming down the sides and possible seeping into the interior.<br />30) There needs to be mounting points on each of the 4 corners of the booth to secure a 2" diameter round pole that will extend above the booth roof.<br />31) There needs to be sufficient weather proofing to prevent the booth from leaking in a "typical" rain storm.<br />32) Since this is a custom or modified design, questions, or issues must be collaborated with the user to insure the tower meets requirements. Suggest pictures, measurements during fabrication and a site visit prior to painting to insure completeness.<br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-23.<br />The following clauses are incorporated by reference: FAR 52-212-1, Instructions to Offers-Commercial Item and any addenda to the provisions; (JAN 99), 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items; (JAN 05) Technical capibility is more important than price, 52-212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items (Offerors must submit a complete copy with their offers; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items; (OCT 03), FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, incorporating the following:<br />&bull; 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns; <br />&bull; 52.222-3, Convict Labor; <br />&bull; 52.222-19 Child Labor - Cooperation With Authorities and Remedies; <br />&bull; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; <br />&bull; 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; <br />&bull; 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled, Veterans, Veterans fo the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; <br />&bull; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers With Disabilities; <br />&bull; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; <br />&bull; 52.225-3, Buy American Act-Free Trade Agreements-Israeli Trade Act; <br />&bull; 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases; <br />&bull; 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration;<br />&bull; FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination<br />52.233-2, Service of Protest;, <br />52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government with Alternate I;(Jul 95), <br />52.223-11 Ozone-Depleting Substances; (MAY 01), 52.247-34, F.O.B Destination , (11/91), <br />52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference; (FEB 98), This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<p>Phase 3: HCQIS Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management</p>
<p>
<p>The HealthCare Quality Information System (HCQIS) is a major application environment that uses application groups, shared servers, and WAN to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. HCQIS is composed of 5 application groups:</p>
<p>&bull; Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) for Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), including the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC);</p>
<p>&bull; Value Based Purchasing (VBP) IT Infrastructure for Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) and Hospital Outpatient;</p>
<p>&bull; Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb);</p>
<p>&bull; Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) for states and CMS;</p>
<p>&bull; Quality Improvement Initiatives (QII)</p>
<p>This statement of work is related to Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management for the SDPS and VBP application groups and is phase 3, of a 4-phase process. The other phases will be issued as separate solicitations with their specific SOW, requirements, evaluation criteria, etc. The Government estimates that it will issue these separate solicitations during 2008-2009. This information is being provided as informational only and it does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. The four Phases that currently being developed are:</p>
<p>Phase 1 - Program Management and Business Requirement Contract (PMBR)<br />Phase 2 - Infrastructure Contract<br />Phase 3 - Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management Contract (Current Solicitation)<br />Phase 4 - Development Contract</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS), implemented in 1997, supports the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) program and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) community. Prior to SDPS, each QIO was responsible for developing solutions to meet the management and reporting requirements of the Statement of Work (SoW). Besides the obvious inefficiencies of redundant systems and costs, each QIO had different competencies during that period. Since the inception of SDPS, its functions have encompassed support, standardization and development of data, software and standards for the QIO community. SDPS continues to rapidly evolve with innovative technology to meet the challenges of supporting and interfacing directly with the QIO community and surrounding healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) are under contract by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to</p>
<p>&bull; Improve quality of care for beneficiaries;</p>
<p>&bull; Protect the integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund by ensuring that Medicare pays only for services and goods that are reasonable and medically necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting; and</p>
<p>&bull; Protect beneficiaries by expeditiously addressing individual complaints, notices, and appeals, such as beneficiary complaints; provider-issued notices of non-coverage (Hospital-Issued Notice of Non-Coverage [HINN], Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights [NODMAR], and Medicare Advantage appeal); Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) violations; and other related statutory QIO responsibilities.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for the QIO Statement of Work is found in Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982. The Act established the Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization Program, now known as the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program.</p>
<p>The statutory mission of the Program, as set forth in Section 1862(g) of the Act, is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, economy, and quality of services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>In support of the QIO program, CMS authorized the design and implementation of a SDPS for the User Community. SDPS is an information system solution that provides a common platform for users to share applications and data to promote efficiency and increase productivity. SDPS is the QIO Information Technology and data support infrastructure.</p>
<p>The SDPS User Community, for purposes of this contract, refers to the QIOs, the State Agencies, CMS Central and Regional Offices, the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC), and other organizations/partners that may be incorporated in support of CMS initiatives. This system services the daily, ongoing support that the SDPS User Community needs to fulfill their contractual requirements in a manner supportive of an ongoing quality improvement program.</p>
<p>The VBP application group utilizes SDPS applications and warehouses in addition to other VBP specific products. These applications and warehouses support two provisions of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) Division B, Title 1:</p>
<p>1. Section 101, Physician Payment and Quality Improvement, includes The Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI). This law authorizes a financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate in a voluntary quality reporting program. Eligible professionals, who choose to participate and successfully report on a designated set of quality measures for services paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and provided between July 1 and December 31, 2007 to Medicare beneficiaries under the traditional fee-for-service program, may earn a bonus payment of 1.5% of their charges during that period, subject to a cap.</p>
<p>On December 29, 2007, the President signed Public Law 110-173, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA), which authorized the continuation of the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) for 2008. The 2008 PQRI reporting period is January 1-December 31, 2008.</p>
<p>The Extension Act also provides new authorities for enhancing PQRI that CMS will be implementing during 2008. MMSEA requires CMS to establish alternative reporting periods and alternative criteria for satisfactorily reporting groups of measures via claims for 2008. It also requires CMS to establish alternative reporting periods and alternative criteria for satisfactorily reporting measures via registries to enable professionals to earn the 1.5% incentive for participation in PQRI based on data submitted via these mechanisms.</p>
<p>2. Section 109, requires the development of measures for the evaluation of the quality of care of services provided by hospitals in outpatient settings.

As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

<DESC><p>INVENTION SUMMARY:
<p>Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) has submitted a patent application for a continuous liquid loop process to produce and recover the medical isotope cesium 131 using barium 130 or natural barium as a feedstock. Cesium 131 brachytherapy implant seeds are used for radiation treatment of prostate cancer. BEA's process significantly limits any undesirable production of Cs-132; produces a higher purity product; reduces radioactive waste; and eliminates time and cost of reactor target preparation, cooling time, target dissolution and separation steps. Fewer and simplified process steps lowers total operating costs and provides a shorter processing cycle time. Faster recovery of the Cs-131 results in less product being lost to decay. <br /><br />Contact Mr. Gary W. Smith. A potential licensing opportunity exists with BEA, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). BEA is seeking industrial partners interested in entering into a license agreement for the purpose of commercializing the technology described below. This is not an opportunity to provide goods or services to BEA or DOE. This solicitation will close to response sixty (60) days after publication. Parties interested in obtaining additional information should send their request to:</p>

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                    Commandant (G-A)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                Commandant (G-A)

Scope: The VHA Systems Re-design program seeks an internal Veteran Health Administration (VHA) Operations Management Course (OM).  The course is designed to accommodate up to 25 participants for a 6-month period of time.  The purpose of the Operations Management Course is to maximize efficient patient flow and throughput across the hospital healthcare delivery system.  The expectation is that each participant will develop plans, identify aims, and test changes in their inpatient flow areas - each will be expected to identify a project for flow improvement to be conducted during the course.  Faculty will consist of 3-4 VA staff and a contract faculty member. Objectives:  At the conclusion of VHA OM course, participants should be able to:"	Demonstrate understanding of variability analysis"	Demonstrate application of operations management for the participant's Medical Center in order to improve patient flow, patient access, maximize efficiency, and satisfaction for patients and staff. "	Demonstrate understanding of queuing theory and when to apply it as evidenced by the participant's project."	Complete an operations management project for a VA Medical Facility"	Coach and/or teach certain applications of operations management science to VHA Medical Center staff - such as application of queuing theory to work processes and systems.CONTRACTOR SHALL:"	Participate in OM program planning conference call with VHA SR (Systems Redesign) staff to understand project scope. "	Lead planning committee."	Design content for VHA Operations Management Course.  o	Design content for all sessions in collaboration with VHA SR staff;   o	Design to include 2 face-to-face session and 3-5 virtual learning session to be conducted; via live meeting and/or audio teleconferences;  VHA OM Course Component	LengthOverview of Operations ManagementCase Studies from industry and VHAFriday Night in the ER Introduction to Queuing TheoryVariability AnalysisIntroduction to Hospital Projects	2 or 2.5 daysProject Storyboard ReviewCritical Path MethodCase Studies from industry and VHAVariability in Operation RoomsOutcomes data review (from IPEC, FIX, etc)Hospital Modeling software	2 or 2.5 daysCoaching on Project Completion	Virtual Learning SessionsConference Calls"	Develop educational materials to be used by participants;"	Participate in weekly planning calls;"	Serve as faculty at the face to face programs and virtual sessions (live meeting or audio calls);"	Lead participant conference calls;"	Monitor participant accomplishment of projects;  "	Provide feedback to participants on projects;"	Develop and conduct method to evaluate program outcomes (level 3 or 4).  Develop evaluation plan in collaboration with VHA SR office staff; and, "	Report results of evaluation to VHA SR office.After conducting one cycle, propose to evaluate the outcomes of the course participants' and assess whether additional cycles (2 per year could be accommodated) will proceed.  Intention is to provide feedback and recommendation regarding continuation to the SR Steering Committee.2.	Background:Optimizing inpatient flow has been identified as a major initiative for VHA. To accomplish this initiative, the FIX (Flow Improvement Inpatient Initiative) Subcommittee (SR) of the National Systems Redesign Steering Committee sponsored a series of collaboratives across VHA in FY 07 & FY 08 and continued with another round of FIX topic specific Collaboratives in FY 09.  Successful collaboratives were able to use an arsenal of tools to accomplish their goals.  One such tool is the use of Operations Management science.  Operations management represents a field which addresses complex scientific decisions in an uncertain environment.  Through the use of Variability analysis and queuing theory, it has been demonstrated that patient throughput can be improved including: a)	reduction of Emergency Department diversion; b)	reduction of surgery cancellations; i.	reduction of Emergency Department holding overflow ICU patients and reduction of overflow telemetry patients remaining in the ICU due to low bed-availability, etc  Since the VHA has developed performance monitors for the inpatient flow area, it has been established that a focused effort on improving system performance will be beneficial to all facilities.  By improving flow through the operating room, access can be improved and capacity can be maximized.  The Joint Commission has recognized the importance of flow through the hospital and has incorporated it to the Joint Commission's tracer methodology.  By improving flow, capacity, and access; satisfaction of patients, providers, and staff will improve; costs will decrease; and quality will improve.3.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  USAID assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  USAID uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate USAID retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  

INTRODUCTION

In August 2002, USAID began implementation of a program in Venezuela to provide assistance to maintain democratic stability and strengthen the countrys fragile democratic institutions.  The USAID Venezuela program operates out of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and is part of a larger U.S. government effort to promote democratic stability in Venezuela. The program includes a flexible, small grants program which supports activities that promote peaceful resolution of the current political crisis through facilitating dialogue, public debate on key issues, support to democratic institutions, and the promotion of citizen participation and democratic leadership.  The program also supports Venezuelan civil society organizations that work on a variety of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, health care and legislative and judicial system monitoring.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that USAID has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent USAID and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the Regional Team Leader, and is based in Caracas as the senior USAID representative in the country.  This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.      

The Country Representatives principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of USAIDs Venezuela country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent USAIDs mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.  

Duties and Responsibilities

The work of the USAID Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based USAID Regional Team Leader for Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), the Country Representative will:

	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;

	Serve as USAIDs primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;

	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;

	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS (USAIDs Automated Directives System);

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>**THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN REVISED**

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-30.     

This announcement constitutes the only full and open competition solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541380, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.  

Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance is significantly more important than price.  


This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for the service of sequencing food born pathogens.  The Statement of Work is as follows:


Background 
One of the FDA missions in the Division of Molecular Biology, Office of Applied Research and Safety Assessment, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, is to develop efficient and rapid identification of food born pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella species, Cronobacter species and other enteric bacterial food contaminants and to relate those food born samples to clinical samples, especially in the case of food borne outbreaks of disease. 
	For the last 20 years, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been the standard used by the CDC and FDA through Pulse Net to characterize outbreak strains.  Both increased knowledge and changing technologies are changing the way outbreak strains need to be identified.  Specifically, the knowledge of entire genome sequences of over a hundred bacteria, variants in these sequences, and technologies of optical mapping, PCR, DNA microarrays (chips), mass spectroscopy, nucleotide signatures (snps), DNA sequencing and several other new technologies all promise potentially more rapid, less expensive, and better identification of food born pathogens.  
	As part of ongoing research on the cost, speed and usefulness of these different technologies we have been comparing sequencing, optical mapping, DNA microchip arrays, and other technologies.  Sequences of new Cronobacter species would provide critical information for ongoing outbreak analysis and would allow the evaluation of these other technologies for identifying Cronobacter isolates.

Objective 
The purpose of this contract is to ensure the timely delivery of genomic DNA sequences from ten Cronobacter species.  The quality, cost, and speed of  examining a strain of food born bacteria will be compared to other technologies of strain examination and identification.  

Project Scope 
This contract will provide ten genomic sequences to the Division of Molecular Biology FDA.  

Description of Work; Three phases
2.0.1 Sequencing.  An isolate of the strain of bacteria to be sequenced is grown and genomic DNA is prepared at the FDA.  DNA is sent to the contractors facility for sequencing.  Several upgrades have been implemented into 454 DNA sequencing, including paired end sequencing to improve sequencing efficiency, and other improvements in overall sequence read length and batch efficiency.  454 GS FLX Titanium Series combines 400-500 base shotgun and multi-span paired end reads (3 Kb, 8 Kb, 20 Kb) to produce for a 4-5 million base pair bacterial chromosome, 99-100% coverage in a  plate run, with 15 x oversampling  in a run time of a week.  
Genomic DNA is sheared into 20 Kb, 8 Kb or 3 Kb fragments and adaptors are added to the end of each fragment.  A paired end library is constructed; DNA fragments containing added adaptors are isolated and amplified for sequencing.
Extra long 400-500 base pair shotgun reads can sequence through many genomic repeats.  

2.0.2 Contig assembly.  All the initial sequencing runs produce hundreds of sequences.  They must be assembled by computers and specially designed software.  From this assembly process for a bacterial genome 2-200 contigs are created for one genome.  

2.0.3 Annotation.  Using known sequences, software packages have been devised to compare the 2-200 contigs to known genes.  These programs are undergoing improvements in efficiency, speed and cost.  Their contribution to the overall cost of a genome sequence is decreasing with new programs.  

Task Deliverables and Milestones: 
Genomic sequences (electronic or on CD), four strains at one time.

Criteria for Acceptance
Deliverables will be submitted to the Principal Investigator who initiated the request.  We expect greater than 95% genome coverage of each strain, in approximately 2-300 contigs.   

Period of Performance 
Date of Award - 12 months

Location, Work Schedule and Travel 
Unless otherwise directed, contractors will adhere to standard work hours, working no more than 40 hours per week and observe all U.S. Government holidays. 

Security and Privacy 
It is not anticipated that the contractor will be exposed to sensitive Agency information or data. But, the contractor agrees that contract personnel will not divulge or release information or data developed or obtained in connection with performance of this contract, unless made public by FDA or upon written approval by the Project Officer.  The contractor will complete an NPI (Non-Public Information) Agreement prior to award being made. 

Contractor Conformance with Applicable Laws, Regulations, Policies and Standards
The Contractor shall be responsible for knowledge of and compliance with all applicable federal information technology and information management laws, regulations, policies and standards at the government-wide, HHS and FDA levels. At the government-wide level, these include Office of Management and Budget (OMB), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and General Accounting Office (GAO). These can be primarily found at or through the Federal CIO Council website at: http://www.cio.gov. HHS documents are found at: http://www.cdc.gov/irmo. 

Past Experience 
The contractor must be able to demonstrate past experience directly relevant to the types of work needed. Such experience includes projects performed in the past two years similar in scope to the requirements of this Statement of Work. 

Payment Terms 
Payment to be made within 30 days of delivery of sequence.

<p>Responses to questions submitted on 5/26/09.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a rail site near the plant so shipments can be delivered by rail?</p>
<p>Yes, there is a&nbsp;Union Pacific rail line within 100 yards of the plant.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;there is storage at the Nogales plant for less than 15,000 gallons.&nbsp; The plant will take deliveries in the range of 6,500 to 12,000 gallons at a time.&nbsp; Any rail car storage issue will be&nbsp;between vendor and Union Pacific.&nbsp; Vendor would still be required to unload and deliver product via truck.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Are you currently purchasing carbon?</p>
<p>IBWC&nbsp;is not purchasing glycerin at this time.&nbsp; It is being purchased by the construction manager as part of the Nogales plant start agreement.&nbsp; Once the facility is under IBWC's&nbsp;control, the agency&nbsp;will be required to provide the glycerin with&nbsp;agency&nbsp;funds.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Is this a new requirement?</p>
<p>Yes, this is&nbsp;a new requirement for the new Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant to be completed on or about 6/23/09.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to question #2 above, please advise from whom the plant manager is purchasing material, price per gl paid and FOB terms.</p>
<p>Since this is currently not&nbsp;our contract to purchase product, we are unable to provide information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Do you use any activated carbon in your wastewater treatment process? I was reading through the bid document and only saw glycerin and corn syrup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;No we do not use activated carbon. We had looked at it as a possible source but the expense was too great. Also we are limited by the equipment we have to use&nbsp;glycerin or corn syrup. Any other carbon source would require us to invest quite substantially in&nbsp;infrastructure to support it (this rules out methanol, ethanol etc.).</p>

<DESC>The purposes of this amendment are to (a) extend the closing date until July 6, 2009, 5:00 PM Eastern Time and (b) to answer recent questions regarding the solicitation or concerns from interested parties.  The following questions have been submitted, and answers are provided as Response below each question.

1. In the solicitation, NIST only makes mention of raw clock speed and core count, but for instance, an Intel Nehalem will process significantly more IPCs than an Intel Penryn or AMD Istanbul. Do you have any performance metrics that you are trying to achieve, and if so, what are they?

Response: The specification given is the minimum requirement per node.

2. You specify minimum raw disk space but do not mention whether that raw disk space will be acceptable as JBODs or if arrays are desired. We need clarification on this point in particular before proceeding with a configuration quotation/RFI submission.

Response: The raw disk space disks shall be JBOD in each node.

3. You state in your response to vendor question no. 3: What is the rational for 1.5TB SATA desktop-class hard drive?  Is this a requirement or would you consider others?  NIST Response: The 1.5TB SATA desktop-class is a minimum specification; enterprise class drives are not required. However, will enterprise class drives be acceptable if they meet or exceed your minimum requirements?

Response: Yes.

4. How critical is node operating system data integrity? Is OS redundancy desirable or unnecessary?

Response: Node operating system data integrity is not necessary.

5.  What is the required length of the network cables?

Response: The required length for the network cables is 6 feet.

<DESC>The C-130J requires a quantity of 110 Secure Voice remote controls that are Night Vision (NVIS) compatible.  The only remotes in the Government's inventory are not NVIS compatible.  A Type V, NVIS Panel has been identified by the item/program manager to be procured so the available remotes can be modified with the panel to become NVIS compatible.    The panel will be provided to the San Antonio Air Logistics Center for modification and installation on the remotes in inventory.  Once the installation is completed, the remotes will be shipped to the C-130J bases.Part number for panel required is ON460513-8.  Market Research has shown that Photo Etch is the last known and only known source of this panel.Procuring the panel and upgrading remotes will enable the C-130J aircraft to meet mission requirements.

<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates the award of a single Firm-Fixed Price, Construction Contract. The intent of this notice is to seek a contractor to replace the existing non-lethal/lethal fence system high voltage lead out wire at four Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities: USP Tucson, AZ; USP Pollock, LA; USP Terre Haute, IN; and USP McCreary, KY. All four project sites are existing high security United States Penitentiaries. During installation, the Offeror will be required to coordinate and cooperate with institution staff to maintain the security of the institution perimeter, including preparation and approval of security/security background checks in compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 and local institution requirements for entry to the respective active USP. The Non-Lethal/Lethal Electrified Fence system consists of approximately 5500' of high voltage fence structure which is divided into zones; Concrete grade beams and sidewalks which flank the system; underground high voltage feed and return conductors, several per zone; Energizer cabinets and enclosures; Underground pull boxes; Buried rigid conduit; Computerized head end equipment; Safety interlocks and grounding system; Surge protection and riser connections. The lead-out cable is comprised of a 14 AWG steel core encased in a low density poly ethylene inner jacket coupled with a high density poly ethylene outer jacket. Due to a faulty extrusion process, the inner jacket is cracking and deteriorating, thus burning holes in the outer jacket which in turn grounds the system out.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for performing specific interrelated tasks as outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW). These tasks will include, but not be limited to, 1) removing all existing non-lethal/lethal fence high voltage lead out and riser cable; 2) replacing the non-lethal/lethal fence high voltage lead out and riser cable with new cable as specified in the SOW; 3) determining wire quantity by confirming wire distances at each facility; 4) testing the cable for shorts and opens prior to the cable termination in accordance with the cable manufacturers recommendations; 5) terminating the new high voltage cable to the fence structure, surge arresters, safety relays and energizers; and 6) coordinating the non-lethal/lethal fence manufacturer for an onsite inspection and system tuning prior to re-energizing the system. The anticipated performance period of this contract is to have first delivery by July 30, 2009, after the initial notices to proceed is issued. The performance period of each installation is 30 calendar days, with coordinated staggered notice to proceed. The estimated magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238210. The following evaluation factors will be used in evaluating proposals, which are listed in descending order of importance, past performance, technical, and price.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">It has come to CMS' attention that solicitation number: <strong>RFP-CMS-2009-SB-RAD-03</strong> was inadvertently cancelled by a computer glitch, not by anyone at CMS. To allow for adequate competition, CMS is reposting the solicitation under the new solicitation number: <strong>RFP-CMS-2009-SB-RAD-03A</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This solicitation, RFP-CMS-2009-SB-RAD-03 is hereby cancelled and replaced with solicitation, RFP-CMS-2009-SB-RAD-03A.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">***************************************************************</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />Phase 3: HCQIS Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management</p>
<p>The HealthCare Quality Information System (HCQIS) is a major application environment that uses application groups, shared servers, and WAN to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. HCQIS is composed of 5 application groups:</p>
<p>&bull; Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) for Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), including the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC);</p>
<p>&bull; Value Based Purchasing (VBP) IT Infrastructure for Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) and Hospital Outpatient;</p>
<p>&bull; Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb);</p>
<p>&bull; Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) for states and CMS;</p>
<p>&bull; Quality Improvement Initiatives (QII)</p>
<p>This statement of work is related to Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management for the SDPS and VBP application groups and is phase 3, of a 4-phase process. The other phases will be issued as separate solicitations with their specific SOW, requirements, evaluation criteria, etc. The Government estimates that it will issue these separate solicitations during 2008-2009. This information is being provided as informational only and it does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. The four Phases that currently being developed are:</p>
<p>Phase 1 - Program Management and Business Requirement Contract (PMBR)<br />Phase 2 - Infrastructure Contract<br />Phase 3 - Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management Contract (Current Solicitation)<br />Phase 4 - Development Contract</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS), implemented in 1997, supports the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) program and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) community. Prior to SDPS, each QIO was responsible for developing solutions to meet the management and reporting requirements of the Statement of Work (SoW). Besides the obvious inefficiencies of redundant systems and costs, each QIO had different competencies during that period. Since the inception of SDPS, its functions have encompassed support, standardization and development of data, software and standards for the QIO community. SDPS continues to rapidly evolve with innovative technology to meet the challenges of supporting and interfacing directly with the QIO community and surrounding healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) are under contract by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to</p>
<p>&bull; Improve quality of care for beneficiaries;</p>
<p>&bull; Protect the integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund by ensuring that Medicare pays only for services and goods that are reasonable and medically necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting; and</p>
<p>&bull; Protect beneficiaries by expeditiously addressing individual complaints, notices, and appeals, such as beneficiary complaints; provider-issued notices of non-coverage (Hospital-Issued Notice of Non-Coverage [HINN], Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights [NODMAR], and Medicare Advantage appeal); Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) violations; and other related statutory QIO responsibilities.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for the QIO Statement of Work is found in Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982. The Act established the Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization Program, now known as the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program.</p>
<p>The statutory mission of the Program, as set forth in Section 1862(g) of the Act, is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, economy, and quality of services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>In support of the QIO program, CMS authorized the design and implementation of a SDPS for the User Community. SDPS is an information system solution that provides a common platform for users to share applications and data to promote efficiency and increase productivity. SDPS is the QIO Information Technology and data support infrastructure.</p>
<p>The SDPS User Community, for purposes of this contract, refers to the QIOs, the State Agencies, CMS Central and Regional Offices, the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC), and other organizations/partners that may be incorporated in support of CMS initiatives. This system services the daily, ongoing support that the SDPS User Community needs to fulfill their contractual requirements in a manner supportive of an ongoing quality improvement program.</p>
<p>The VBP application group utilizes SDPS applications and warehouses in addition to other VBP specific products. These applications and warehouses support two provisions of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) Division B, Title 1:</p>
<p>1. Section 101, Physician Payment and Quality Improvement, includes The Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI). This law authorizes a financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate in a voluntary quality reporting program. Eligible professionals, who choose to participate and successfully report on a designated set of quality measures for services paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and provided between July 1 and December 31, 2007 to Medicare beneficiaries under the traditional fee-for-service program, may earn a bonus payment of 1.5% of their charges during that period, subject to a cap.</p>
<p>On December 29, 2007, the President signed Public Law 110-173, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA), which authorized the continuation of the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) for 2008. The 2008 PQRI reporting period is January 1-December 31, 2008.</p>
<p>The Extension Act also provides new authorities for enhancing PQRI that CMS will be implementing during 2008. MMSEA requires CMS to establish alternative reporting periods and alternative criteria for satisfactorily reporting groups of measures via claims for 2008. It also requires CMS to establish alternative reporting periods and alternative criteria for satisfactorily reporting measures via registries to enable professionals to earn the 1.5% incentive for participation in PQRI based on data submitted via these mechanisms.</p>
<p>2. Section 109, requires the development of measures for the evaluation of the quality of care of services provided by hospitals in outpatient settings. An Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program modeled after the current Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Reporting Hospital Quality Data Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program will be established.</p>
<p>Section 109, which applies to hospitals as defined under section 1886(d)(1(B) of the Act, also requires that hospital outpatient departments (HOPD) that fail to report data required for the quality measures selected by the Secretary will incur a reduction in their annual OPD fee schedule increase factor by 2.0 percentage points. OPPS payments beginning in CY 2009 will be based on hospital reporting of OPD data beginning in CY 2008.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Statement of Work (SoW) is to obtain adhoc report, analytic, and data management services to support the Healthcare Quality Information Systems Value Based Purchasing (VBP) and Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) application groups.</p>

For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. Indicative is an application performance monitoring tool for measuring application performance on numerous platforms. Procurement of Follow-on Maintenance support for this would include (8 hours) 5x8 next day phone support and SUS (Software Update Service) to include: Telephone/Web assistance, remote support and software update/upgrade services. ENM currently owns this software product so upgrades must be acquired by the same Indicative Brands.  If the maintenance and upgrades are not procured under the same Brand Name ENM runs the risk of violating our maintenance agreement and could incur copyright violations.An identification of the stautory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 41 USCODE 253 (C) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. A demonstration that the propsed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement. ENM currently utilizes the Indicative products and requires the maintenance support in order to provide updates and upgrades as needed.  The product we own "Indicative" is the property of Nimsoft. The only entity able to provide upgrades, bug fixes, or cover any issues with the product is Nimsoft. It's important we move on this to maintain our coverage for the product. The ILMS application relies on this product to identify performance issues throughout the network.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p><strong>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY</strong>. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the <strong>small business and socio-economic market</strong> for the type of work described herein. The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are <strong>qualified small business concerns capable</strong> of furnishing the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) with
<p>1) <strong>Oceanographic Technician</strong> - The Oceanographic Technician must have at least 10 years experience and a college degree in oceanography or trade school training in oceanographic technical support.</p>
<p>The Oceanographic Technician must demonstrate they have the expertise for collecting, processing, interpreting, archiving, and documenting the oceanographic and meteorological data; and demonstrate that they can perform the work utilizing the current NOAA at-sea data collection software (Scientific Computing System).</p>
<p>2) <strong>Electronic Technician</strong> - The Electronic Technician must have at least 5 years experience in electrical or electronic engineering. A professional certification (e.g., a Professional Engineering (PE) certificate or the US equivalent) is desirable but not required.</p>
<p>The Electronic Technician must demonstrate the ability to provide general shipboard electronic technician (ET) support and specialized skills and services in the shipboard maintenance, operation, and repair of instruments for measuring seawater properties, meteorological conditions, and multi-frequency acoustic backscatter.</p>
<p>Personnel must demonstrate their expertise in calibrating, monitoring, and maintaining the performance of a multi-frequency scientific echosounder system (SIMRAD EK500, EK60, and others).</p>
<p>Personnel must demonstrate that this experience is on a similar scale to that prescribed herein, in terms of the physical environment of the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, the northern Antarctic Peninsula, and other regions of the southern Scotia Sea.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (Title III of Pubic Law 98-623, 16 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) provides the legislative authority necessary to implement, with respect to the United States, the Antarctic Living Marine Resources (AMLR) program. The AMLR program, which is managed by the Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division (AERD) at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), provides information to the U.S. delegation to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), part of the Antarctic treaty system.</p>
<p>CCAMLR is an international treaty that seeks to manage Antarctic fisheries with the goal of preserving species diversity and stability of the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem. In keeping with this objective, CCAMLR has designated areas of research that member nations are obligated to pursue. The AMLR Program has identified specific datasets that must be collected to respond to CCAMLR's research directives. In doing so, the AMLR Program supports the U.S. Government's commitment to CCAMLR.</p>
<p>Each austral season, the AMLR Program conducts two research cruise legs in the study area. Within the study area, the Program has defined a large-area survey grid of approximately 108 stations around Elephant, Clarence, King George, and Livingston Islands, which will be occupied once on each cruise leg. In addition, station transects across hydrographic features, directed net sampling, fine-scale acoustic surveys, and other specialized studies are conducted. In some years, a single "krill" leg and a "fish" leg is conducted. In all other years, two "krill" legs are conducted.</p>
<p>A critical component of the shipboard operations is the collection and archiving of data used to describe the physical environment. These data include 1) continuous observations of sea surface and meteorological conditions, and 2) vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, light transmission, and other parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The overall purpose of this contract is to provide meteorological and oceanographic data, which will be used to describe frontal zones, water mass structure and surface currents near Antarctic Peninsula. This information will in turn be used to study the physical causes of variations in biological production in the area. These studies ultimately lead to the formulation of management advice and options in support of U.S. obligations to CCAMLR.</p>
<p>Specific objectives are: 1) Set up and maintain the instruments, connections and data logging equipment; 2) Collect and archive underway and station data; 3) Provide QA/QC of all physical data; 4) Prepare a report summarizing activities and data collected; and 5) Provide general electronic technician support to other shipboard research components.</p>
<p>The data will be collected during the course of approximately a 62-day cruise, beginning and ending in Punta Arenas, Chile (cruise times and dates are decided each cruise year and are not definite or the same from one cruise year to the next). In addition, there will be a 3-day import prior to the beginning of the cruise and a 2-day mid-cruise port call. 24-hour per day operations will be conducted during portions of the cruise and it is expected that at least two sea-going people will be required to accomplish the tasks listed below. In addition, the contractor shall be responsible for providing transportation to and from Punta Arenas.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall set up, test and maintain two complete data collection systems. The first consists of an underway data logging system using a Windows-based program called "Shipboard Computer System", a serial port multiplexer and various sensors. The sensors include a Pacific Environmental Systems WeatherPak, a SeaBird 21 thermosalinograph, and digitized inputs from the ship's gyrocompass and GPS. Additional sensors may include a flow-through transmissometer, a light meter, and a fluorometer. The second system consists of a SeaBird 911+ CTD with bottle carousel, oxygen sensor and altimeter; additional instruments could include transmissometers, fluorometers and light meters. Water samples would be taken from 7-10 depths but no analysis will be conducted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall collect underway data whenever the ship is underway: during transits to and from port, during survey operations, during calibration activities and while servicing shore camps. Data products will include real time displays of selected variables, time averaged data logs indexed by position, date and time, and a report describing the data collection activities and associated files. Collect of CTD data will be conducted at fixed survey stations (approximately 115 stations on each of two surveys) plus occasional unscheduled stations (less than 20 total). Data products will include raw scan data files, processed and bin averaged data files, sample bottle files, and a report describing the data collection activities and associated files.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall assure that data collected by the oceanographic program meet high standards. This may require re-processing of historical data collected by previous AMLR surveys with up-to-date algorithms. Quality control and assurance procedures shall include error checking for all stations. Basic QA will also require data entry into a US AMLR database that will record station and cast information at each sampling station.</p>
<p>Period of performance is a base year from date of award through September 30, 2010 and four (4) option years. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990 with a size standard of $7 million. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required. <strong>NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.</strong> No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement by July 10, 2009.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is expanding the radar capabilities at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF). This involves the addition of a remote balloon launching facility at our North Slope of Alaska (NSA), Barrow, Research Site. This facility will enable radio sonde launches to take place on a regular schedule with little impact from severe local weather conditions that can at times cause launches to be canceled because operators are unable to reach the site.</p>
<p>Performing balloon launches on a regular schedule in arctic climates can become a difficult, time consuming, even dangerous occupation. At the NSA site, access roads can easily become closed by blizzard conditions and cold temperatures can compromise the integrity of a launch. In order to maintain a set launch schedule it may be necessary to keep personnel on-site well beyond their normal working hours. The desire to increase the number of daily BBSS operations can make this effort extremely expensive. The implementation of a remote balloon launching facility that can launch a considerable number of balloons on a regular schedule unattended will allow for long-range cost savings and a safer operating environment.</p>
<p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting proposals from prospective offers to provide a remote balloon launcher in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill and launch radiosonde balloons (up to 800 g in size) with attached radiosondes automatically<br />&bull; Capable of performing at least 24 consecutive launches without attendance, including balloon filling (helium) and ground check procedures associated with the Vaisala Digicora radiosonde system<br />&bull; Provides storage location for helium<br />&bull; Capable of operating in extreme weather conditions, including high winds, blizzard conditions, extreme cold (-40 C)<br />&bull; Heated shelter for preconditioning/preparing balloons at 1-2 wk intervals<br />&bull; Ability to control and monitor launch schedule remotely<br />&bull; Capable of arbitrary, changeable launch schedule<br />&bull; Has a NIST traceable surface weather station for ground comparison</p>
<p>The request for proposal can be found at <a href="http://www.pnl.gov/contracts/solicitations/">http://www.pnl.gov/contracts/solicitations/</a>&nbsp; then RECOVERY ACT:&nbsp; Remote Balloon Launcher</p>

<AWARDEE>AADCO INC;115 N 2ND AVE;BEECH GROVE;IN;461071305
<DESC>The Justification below is being posted in accordance with FAR 6.305(a):JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONBased on the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) under FAR 6.302-1a.1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  VISN 11 Contract Service Center2669 Cold Spring RoadIndianapolis, Indiana 462222.	Nature/Description of ActionIn accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.303-2(a), this document sets forth the justification and acceptance approval for one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(a)(2). To establish a sole source contract with AADCO, Inc. to provide construction services to provide a code compliant integrated fire alarm system for the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center. Contract period is expected to be 180 calendar days from issuance of Notice to Proceed. 3.	Description of Supplies/ServicesAADCO shall provide all tools, equipment, material, labor and supervision necessary to upgrade the fire alarm system in the existing A, B, C and D wings within Building 1, WTS at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis, Indiana. 4.	Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and open CompetitionThe statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).5.	Demonstration of Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of Authority CitedThe Medical Center recently activated the new 7th and 8th floors in the A-wing and provided new code compliant ADA Fire Alarm Devices.  However, the entire hospital is not in compliance with the latest NFPA regulations and ADA Fire Alarm and will need to be upgraded to the latest Fire Alarm Codes/devices.  The medical center's goal is to have the same standard of care through out the entire facility, which requires the upgrade of the rest of the facilities Fire Alarm System to be capable of integrating with the new areas.  The purpose of an integrated facility-wide Fire Alarm System is that if an alarm would sound off, the entire system reacts to the code.  If the Fire Alarm System is not compatible in all areas, care givers outside their areas could miss the alarm and endanger patient and staff safety.  Aadco, Inc. is a local authorized distributor and installer of the existing Pyrotronics Fire Alarm System and Software.  All warranties would be voided and the System could shutdown if other software and devices were to assimilate their system with the one existing.  Aadco has the current contract for maintenance of the existing system and their software runs the facility Fire Alarm System.  The Pyrotronics Fire Alarm System is the only system that will allow for the same functionality as the rest of the facility.  Aadco, Inc. is the current maintenance provider and has the software license to the Fire Alarm System.  The facility-wide upgrade must be Pyrotronics and Aadco because no other system will effectively integrate all components of the existing Fire Alarm System, including the MXL System Main Panel and individual modules located throughout the facility.  Introducing another vendor's devices and software would cause interference with the currently installed systems.  Other systems have not been approved and are not guaranteed that they could be connected to the MXL System Main Panel.  As stated above, Aadco is a local licensed carrier of Pyrotronics Fire Alarm System in our area, and therefore a sole source is necessary of the facility-wide Fire Alarm System Upgrade.6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure a Variety of Potential SourcesAadco, Inc. provides yearly maintenance and installations to the facility.  Pyrotronics is the only Fire Alarm installed and operated within the facility.  The facility does not want to mix other Fire Alarm Devices within the current system or the devices and software will not operate effectively.  No other complete responses were received in response to the intent to sole source notice posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website on May 20, 2009. Additional market research was not conducted, as the facility upgrade requires the same system continuity and standard of care as stated above in item 5 to insure patient and staff safety.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost to the GovernmentThis contractor will provide information (i.e. other than cost or pricing data), which could include commercial price lists and prices for similar or the same services provided to other customers as well as thorough breakdowns of labor and materials to assist the Contracting Officer in determining if the contractor's proposed price is fair and reasonable for the services to be provided. The Contracting Officer anticipates the cost of this procurement to be fair and reasonable.8.	Description of Market SurveyThe intent to sole source notice posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website on May 20, 2009 invited proposals and information to be submitted in order to determine if a competitive procurement was a viable option. No additional market survey was necessary due to Aadco, Inc. currently providing yearly maintenance and installations to the facility.  Pyrotronics is the only Fire Alarm installed and operated within the facility.  9.	Any Other Supporting DataNone10.	Listing of Interested Sources"	AADCO, Inc 115 N 2nd Avenue, Beech Grove, IN 46107 11.	Actions That May be Taken to Overcome Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:None, this is a nonrecurring requirement.12.	Contracting Officers CertificationThe Contracting Officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.

<p>RECOVERY - Rationale for a contract action that is not both, fixed price and competitively awarded, as required by FAR Subpart 5.7 - Publicizing requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>
<p>Type of contract action: USDOJ/OJP Task Order 2008TO08135under the GSA Contract GS-23F-0288L, OJP-Wide Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) 2008BF08007 Circle Solutions, Inc., to provide the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) with the services and resources required to support three (3) additional financial management seminars nationwide for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This BPA was competitively awarded in April 2008 under the auspices of GSA FSS, Advertising and Integrated Marketing Solutions (AIMS) Schedule Contract, SIN 541-5. This task order was awarded September 2008 against the Circle Solutions BPA to provide logistical support for "2009 Regional Financial Seminars in Washington, DC and 10 States (TBD)". The period of performance of the current task order is September 26, 2008 through December 31, 2009. This modification is within the scope of the task order, the requirement is for 3 more seminars, and it is logical to add these requirements to the Circle Solutions, Inc., existing task order.
