<p>The mass storage resources anticipated for installation within the ESIF upon completion of construction is the focus of this request for proposals (RFP), which is named ESIF-MSS-1 Resource. The ESIF-MSS-1 Resource will provide long-term data retention and backup for the ESIF HPC environment, and includes the following resources:</p>
<p>&bull; Near Line Storage (Tier1) Resource<br />&bull; Second Tier Storage (Tier2) Resource<br />&bull; Validation, Test, and Debugging Client (VTD) Resource,<br /><br />The ESIF-MSS-1 Resource is expected to be a tiered storage solution, with the Near Line Tier consisting of disk and the Second Tier consisting of tape, and will be capable of dynamically moving data to the most appropriate media type, migrating data to new media types as they become available, storing data in open formats, and being accessible by industry standard protocols. The HPC clients are expected to manually move their data to the Near Line storage with standard Linux commands or vendor supplied commands. The data migration is dynamically moved to the Second Tier Storage without client interaction or knowledge. The solution must be able to scale in both performance and capacity to support multiple petabytes (PB) of storage and be extremely cost-effective on the basis of cost-per-gigabyte, density, and operation for cooling and power.

<DESC>The Jack C. Montgomery VA Medical Center is seeking a Contractor interested in providing a comprehensive transitional living program that can deliver transitional living, emergency housing, case management and services consistent with Homeless Veterans Innovative Project (HVIP) contract objectives. The type of Veterans to be cared for under this contract will require therapeutic, rehabilitative, job training and placement and permanent housing placement services over and above the level of room and board.  The goal of the HVIP is to serve 4 to 16 Veterans within the course of 1 year. Veteran's who graduate early or are expeditiously placed into independent housing, will be replaced by a new homeless Veteran as long as the Veteran is able to accomplish his/her goals before the end of the funding period. VA Homeless Program staff will assist contractor with appropriate assessments to determine services needed.
Currently, approximately 67.8% of homeless Veterans in the Jack C. Montgomery service area suffer from a severe mental illness and 79.3% suffer from a substance use disorder. Because of the aforementioned statistics, it is imperative that supportive housing services are implemented. As a result, transitional living for homeless Veterans which provides therapeutic, rehabilitative, job training, job placement and permanent housing placement services would encourage a more adaptive level of psychosocial functioning and independent living. The services that will be provided have 3 main tiers. Tier 1 is for Veterans interested in a formal vocational rehabilitation program.  Tier 2 is for Veterans interested in a formal job training (apprentice) program.  Tier 3 is for Veterans in need of transitional housing to gain life skills and resources essential to secure independent housing.   
It is expected this contract will be a firm fixed-price contract.  The Contractor shall be required to furnish all necessary and appropriate labor, supervision, materials, equipment, supplies, and housing to supply the services required for this contract.  The solicitation will be available on or about March 3, 2012.  Solicitation, amendments and other miscellaneous documents shall be posted on FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Each contractor shall be responsible for reviewing this website for amendments, updates, or changes to current information.

The project will consist of converting approximately 4,800 sf of space that is currently being utilized as an interim pharmacy locations while the new pharmacy area is being renovated, to include clinical space, waiting areas and medication storage space.  The design will need to ensure that the existing footprint is completely reconfigured to include wall demolitions, ceilings, flooring, asbestos abatement and electrical and mechanical systems. The design must replace all electrical and mechanical systems and relocate fire protection as necessary to provide new exam room clinical space. This project will completely demolish the necessary existing walls, electric, lighting, ceiling, floor tile, asbestos mastic abatement, mechanical ductwork for the current temporary pharmacy space on the ground floor and will redesign a new suite of approximately 4,800 sf.  It is expected  that all new electric and mechanical will be required from existing services unless infrastructure increases are necessary, completely new plumbing and drains will need to be run and all architectural finishes will be new and be similar in material to the existing environment and to match the requirements of each clinic.  Of the new exam rooms each room will be outfitted with standard primary care furnishings and utilities to match the rest of the outpatient care clinics. This will include such items as an exam room, hand-washing sink, cabinetry, table, IS cabling and build in work stations. Some of these rooms may also need medical gasses and suction.   

The intent is for the design to occur during FY2012 with construction in FY2013.

Short-List Criteria to select the firms for interview will be based on H09 Hospital and Medical Facilities and E05 Elevators, especially design and construction expertise within existing facilities, technical competence, specific experience and qualifications of proposed personnel and consultants along with record of working together as a team, past performance for VA work, geographic location of the firm, success in prescribing the use of recovered materials, waste reduction and energy efficiency, and the inclusion of small business consultants.  Special consideration in the evaluation and selection process will be given to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  Final ranking of interviewed firms will be based on the team proposed for this project, previous VA experience of the team, and specific structural design experience with existing facilities.

<DESC>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Material Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4114. Point of Contact: Janis Norelli, Small Business Specialist, Phone (315) 330-3311, FAX (315) 330-2784, Email Janis.Norelli@rl.af.mil.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Capable sources are sought to perform research, technology assessment, software development, deployment, familiarization, testing, installation, maintenance, and life cycle support for the next-generation Cross Domain Solution (CDS).</p>
<p>The effort will concentrate on researching new Cross Domain Transfer Solution technologies, enhancing current solutions utilizing technologies from varying Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), and deploying and supporting these solutions to meet the current and rapidly evolving Intelligence needs of the Air Force, Department of Defense, and the 16 Intelligence Community components of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). This effort will result in the availability of scalable, certified, Cross Domain Transfer solutions to be utilized by Air Force, US Government agencies and coalition partners to enable bi-directional flow of data between two or more security domains accredited for operation at different classification levels. Cross Domain Transfer Solutions will provide authorized users the ability to securely transfer data between interconnected security domains, while protecting the security domains from unauthorized access or malicious attack; and auditing all data transfers between security domains.</p>
<p>Over the life of the contract, effort involving the research, enhancement, and deployment within the following areas is anticipated: Information Support Server Environment (ISSE) Cross Domain Transfer Solution, Multi-Level Data Base Replication (MLDBR), Rules Execution and Modification Capability Workflow Enforcement Services (REMC-WES), REMC-Space (for Joint Space Operations Center-JSpOC) and "Tearline" Processing for AFPAK.</p>
<p>As Cross Domain transfer requirements continue to evolve, the need for rapid research, enhancements, and deployment of the above mentioned and new cross domain solutions will be required.</p>
<p>Cross security domain information sharing is critical to the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency's Combat ISR Office, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, and existing ISSE user sites. This effort supports Air Force efforts in providing commands with required Cross-Domain C2ISR information, when and where it is needed.</p>
<p>This cross domain information sharing program will develop a next generation Cross Domain Security (CDS) capability, enhance the current CDS at the Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units and maintain CDS at current sites. It will be necessary to provide analysis, design, software development, integration management, deployment, system and network administration/operation, technical documentation and testing to support the maintenance and evaluation of existing systems and of new development systems. In the course of performance, the support personnel will interface with various agencies and commands throughout the DoD through electronic means and visits to various DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community, 5-Eyes coalition partners and NATO organization sites worldwide. The support personnel will also provide technical support to AFRL/RIE to assist in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing and evaluation. Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation as well as hardware suites to satisfy operational user's requirements.</p>
<p>AFRL will be conducting a Pre-solicitation Informational Meeting for this acquisition. The purpose of this meeting is to provide interested companies with an overview of the program and an opportunity to gather more information prior to the RFP being issued. This meeting will be combined with the Pre-Solicitation Information Meeting for High-Security Environment Infrastructure Development &amp; Integration (HEIDI). Further information regarding this meeting will follow in a special notice.</p>
<p>Interested parties are advised that to perform this acquisition, the successful offeror will be required to have, at the time of award, twenty five (25) personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances and five (5) additional personnel people with Secret collateral clearances (total for prime and subcontractors).

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of potential contractors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
This is not a request for proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this sources sought notice.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.
The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region has a requirement to provide and install time-transit, acoustic velocity meters (AVM) in the 4, twenty-two foot penstocks.  Work to install the AVM's will include, but may not be limited to, installation of the transducers with an internal mount, installation of the wiring and cabling necessary for communications, and installation of the AVM electronics in the Parker Dam Control Room and at the penstock location.  The AVM must be capable of 8 path measurement using a Jacobi-Gauss integration method, and have the capability to report the standard deviation of measurement and to calculate and report the uncertainty of measurement. AVM's must be capable of communicating in these communications protocols: MODBUS-serial via RS-485, MODBUS-TCP/IP, and 4-20ma with a minimum of 12 bit resolution. AVM must be capable of operating between ambient temperatures of 22-140F. AVM must be capable of accuracy  0.5%. 
Installation must meet the standards of ASME PTC-200X. 
The future solicitation will schedule a date for a site visit for vendors to inspect the site prior to submittal of proposals; an internal penstock inspection may or may not be possible based on plant operational schedule.  Prospective vendors may be asked to demonstrate equipment capabilities on site at Parker Dam, CA.
Vendors should be aware that Penstock 1 is a short length and they will be unable to achieve the typical 5 pipe diameters used to limit turbulence in the water during measurement and develop a plan to achieve optimum results in that condition.
The proposed procurement instrument will be a firm fixed-price contract.  This acquisition, when announced, will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334513, Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables (Flow instruments, industrial process-type, manufacturing) with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
Interested vendors are invited to submit capability packages describing the products/services they provide related to providing and installing the AVM's meeting the above requirements.  Packages should include the following information:  
(1) Provide business name, address, business size and socio-economic type (8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number. (2) Demonstrate the firm's experience by providing a list of projects completed where the work involved the design installation of AVM's in penstock sizes between 18-50 ft. completed within the past five years, and in which your firm performed the installation.  Specify in the list the extent of work completed by your firm and that work which was subcontracted.  Additionally, for each project listed, provide the following: a brief description of the work performed, project title, dollar value of the job, the plant name, plant location, and the customer's contact name and phone number for the work completed.  (3) Provide product data/catalogues of the types of time transit acoustic velocity meters available that may meet the above requirements including commercial catalogue prices if available.
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Dennis Campbell/LC-10215, Contract Specialist, P.O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail to DLCampbell@usbr.gov  by March 1, 2012.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking information in preparation of an anticipated future solicitation/solicitations for an information technology solution to automate support processes for the Agency's scientific business services. This request for information (RFI) is not a solicitation and does not guarantee that the Government will proceed with a solicitation or award of a contract in the future. This request is only for market research purposes, and its purpose is to poll vendors about a potential solution to meet CDC's scientific business needs.
<p>The Scientific Support Services Project (S3P) represents the cross-Agency efforts of OADS and Centers, Institutes, and Office (CIO) program staff conducting research and scientific studies throughout the world to improve scientific administrative and management oversight activities at the Federal level. S3P aims to improve the efficiency, quality, accountability, and user friendliness of three Scientific Integrity services, and to enhance the ability to process a project in a consistent, logical manner using Information Technology (IT) systems. S3P is following the CDC implementation of the HHS Enterprise Performance Life Cycle framework established by HHS policy in 2008. S3P includes formal governance for all activities and decisions related to executing the project.</p>
<p>A key goal of S3P is to modernize IT that supports the goals of OSI across the Agency including its world wide science and research. The desired capabilities of the resulting S3P system(s) are derived from existing functionality of current systems (to be retired) and new functionality that is not covered by the current systems. The S3P end solution will include one or multiple "best in breed" commercial and/or open source software products to be integrated via configuration or customization into a single solution to meet the defined capabilities. The solution will reside on-premise at CDC.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This Sources Sought (SS) Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).<br /><br />The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns, including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) that are interested in and capable of providing an MRI compatible video monitoring system.</p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).&nbsp; There is no solicitation available at this time. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br /><br />The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns, particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) under</p>

<p>NHLBI requires an MRI compatible video monitoring system which allows MRI technicians to monitor patients undergoing MRI procedures. Video monitoring will reduce radio frequency electromagnetic radiation that a window to the MRI room would cause. Since there are no windows between the control room and the scan room, the system will provide the only visual contact between the technician and the patient. A high quality system must be used because a low quality system could compromise patient safety.</p>

<DESC>Yellowstone National Park annouces it is intending to purchase name brand only Gasboy 9850KX-D dispensing Unit with additional accessories.
The justification for this name brand only requirement is as follows:
The existing dispensing unit (Gasboy 9859KX-D) has been in Grant Village approx. 5 years; We will need this dispensing unit operational when snow crew arrives to open the park.  The park is presently over snow vehicles only so getting a unit out now is out of the question.  There is a very short window in which to take out the old one and replace it.  This dispenser has internal satellite piping to connect to a slave dispenser.  This unit sits on a concrete slab on an island that is 16 inches thick.  Under the dispenser is a containment sump that is sized to match the dispenser. The sump has underground product piping that is connected to fire/shear valves, as well as numerous electrical conduits and sensor penetrations that connect directly to the dispenser.  The dispenser also connects to the slave dispenser via internal piping.  There is no room for alternations on any of these applications, without major demolition work to the concrete, which could jeopardize safety, the sump pan, the 10,000 gallon fiberglass fuel tank, product piping and electrical wiring.
Any vendor interested in receiving the combined synopsis/solicitation or to make comments on the name brand requirement should email Andrea_Hannon@nps.gov. Comments and requests must be received my February 22, 2012.

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helv">The appraisal shall conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), the Code of Professional Ethics and the Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice of the Appraisal Institute, as well as the guidelines of the U.S. General Services Administration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Appraisal Contractor and the lead field appraiser are to be Certified General Real Estate Appraisers for the state your firm is interested below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Appraiser Contractor shall not engage a subcontractor for these appraisals.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helv">The purpose of the appraisal is to determine the Federal Annual Rental (FAR) for the specific property as of the target date of 10/1/2014. The appraiser will need to derive and state the FAR of the appropriate <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>property-for its office space, as well as parking spaces-as of four effective dates: the date of inspection, 10/1/2012, 10/1/2013, and the target date of 10/1/2014. The appraisal must include, at a minimum, three (3) executed comparable leases to non-governmental tenants within the appraisal. Also, the appraisal must include at least three asking inside monthly parking rental comps for the parking appraisal section of the report. At least three inside parking comps must come from within comparable office buildings with indoor unreserved parking. If the market charges a premium for reserved indoor parking spaces, then the appraiser is to show evidence of those rates from 3 additional reserved indoor monthly parking comps.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helv">In addition to this scope of work, the appraiser shall also be guided by and refer to the following documents which will be attached to the request for proposal in regards to the requirements for the preparation of the appraisal report.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Fort Knox, KY area. The proposed project is to design and construct a standard design Engineer Battalion Complex.  Primary facilities include barracks, battalion and company operations, classroom, and storage facilities.  Supporting facilities include all site utilities, site improvements, fire protection systems, access roads and parking, paving, fencing, walks, curbs, and gutters, and storm drainage. Sustainable Design and Development and Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05) features will be provided.<br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br><br>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br><br>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br>b. The complexity of the project. <br>c. Shortage of skilled labor in region. <br>d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br>e. The use of PLAs on other comparable projects. <br>f. The promotion of the Governments long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br>g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br>h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. <br><br>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br><br>a. Should a PLA be executed on the Fort Knox Engineer Battalion Complex contract? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br><br>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br><br>e. The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on the project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br><br>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br><br>g. Completion of the anticipated project will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br><br>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br><br>Responses shall be submitted via email to Misty Jones at misty.d.jones@usace.army.mil no later than 11:00 AM EST on 22 February 2012.<br><br>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.<br><br>

<a href="mailto:loretta.l.tanner@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of sole source intent by the US Army Corps of Engineers Mobile District, to execute a short term bridge - sole source contract with Hensel Phelps Construction Company to provide facilities operations and maintenance services for the US Southern Command Headquarters and supporting facilities in Miami-Doral, FL for a period of up to six (6) months, from 01 Mar 2012 through 31 Aug 2012.  This proposed contract action follows earlier out of scope modifications to the Hensel Phelps construction contract number W91278-08-C-0021 that was awarded in Apr 2008 and substantially completed 29 Oct 2010.  This is the first short term bridge award, after three contract modifications for the same services. The original modification was for the period November through 31 May 2011, followed by subsequent modifications for the periods 01 Jun through 31 Oct 2011, and 01 Nov 2011 through 29 Feb 2012. It remains the Government's intent to provide for essential facilities operations and maintenance services while the existing Army public works activity expands its capacities and completes the award of an on-going competitive 8(a) solicitation for a more comprehensive facilities operations and maintenance contract under request for proposal number W911SF-11-R-0028 by the US Army Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Fort Benning, Georgia. Federal budgetary and hiring limitations through Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012 have delayed the expansion of the Army's Public Work capacities and delayed the development and execution of this solicitation. The solicitation is currently in the selection phase with an award and notice to proceed expected in Apr 2012, followed by a 45 day transition period between Hensel Phelps and the incoming 8(a) contractor through 31 May 2012. However, the Government is providing notice at this time of its intent to continue the current sole source action for up to six (6) months, through 31 Aug 2012, if necessary to continue services at this critical facility should award and notice to proceed for the new contract be further delayed due to required negotiations, protest resolution, or other unforeseen circumstances. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received within fifteen days after publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.<br><br>Description of Work.  The modification would include firm fixed price for facilities operations, maintenance, and emergency repair/response services for all US Southern Command and US Army Garrison Miami real property facilities, components and systems, and selected improved grounds maintenance (roads, parking, storm water retention, utilities, security fencing and related equipment). It may include a limited capacity to estimate scope/cost, design, and perform minor maintenance and repair projects no longer covered by new construction warranties and/or minor alteration projects to meet new operational requirements.  It will not include landscape maintenance, custodial services, or utilities services.  The facilities complex supported by this modification is a new $400-million campus style complex, substantially completed on 29 Oct 2010, that includes three complex, state-of-the-art multi-purpose and command and control facilities, to included small retail sales and food court facility, totaling over 645,000 square feet, all supporting roads, parking, drainage, storm water retention, utilities, back-up power and other supporting infrastructure.  The complex is located on a government secured 55-acre site in Miami-Doral, FL and supports over 2,400 government employees and contractors that make up Headquarters, US Southern Command (one of six regional US Combatant Commands critical to national security) responsible for command and control of US military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as US Army Garrison Miami, and a diverse array of other supporting tenants and activities.  The site will be secured and require appropriate government background checks and identification for access; with some areas requiring a Secret security clearance and/or escorted access.  The national significance of this site and of the functions it supports requires a unique and significantly high degree of response, urgency, and expertise.<br><br>US Army Garrison - Miami is the current public works activity and is only staffed to coordinate basic building management services for 250,000 square feet of leased facilities acquired through full service leases; expanding those capacities to support the new 670,000 square feet of owned facilities has been delayed through much of 2011 and 2012 due to Army workforce reduction measures and hiring constraints associated with the ongoing federal budget reduction efforts. The organization is only now beginning to develop a capacity to provide the extensive technical information, training and other assistance required to solicit, award and supervise a comprehensive facilities operations and maintenance contract.  As such, developing, executing and starting a comprehensive competitive solicitation for these services, with a contractor that may not be inherently familiar with these complex facilities, has taken longer than anticipated.<br><br>The detailed facilities technical specifications and data for these complex new facilities were not made available and turned over to the Government until almost six months after beneficial occupancy and substantial completion.  As such, combined with the Army's limited public works capacities and required contract solicitation timeline, the Government was unable to solicit competitive contract for these services any earlier than late Sep 2011, and extensive questions and clarifications with offerors took until the end of Dec 2011 due to the aforementioned public works staffing shortfalls.<br><br>Hensel Phelps, as the prime contractor who designed and constructed these complex facilities, and has been performing facility operations and maintenance services, to include warranty management, for the past 16-months, is intimately familiar with the facilities and has the unique knowledge and expertise to provide effective and efficient facilities operations and maintenance services and effectively transition these functions to a new contractor once an award in made in Apr 2012, providing technical assistance and training during transition that is currently beyond the Governments capacity to provide.<br><br>Future Acquisition Strategy & Contracting Opportunities.  The Government is currently soliciting for comprehensive facilities operations and maintenance service for this requirement through an 8A competitive solicitation (W911SF-11-R-0028) being handled by the Fort Benning, Georgia Mission and Installation Contracting Command office.  This solicitation is currently in the selection phase, and the Army anticipates awarding this contract in Apr 2012, with transition between the current provider to occur through May 2012, with full performance by Jun 2012.  This solicitation is for a performance period of five years from date of award, one (1) base year and four (4) additional option years.<br><br>This announcement is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Other Than Full & Open Competition. This notice is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Firms interested in being considered shall provide information regarding their capabilities and experience to perform the requirements as well as past performance of similar work, to include project location and names and telephone numbers of customer points of contact.  Experience shall include facilities operations and maintenance on comparable facilities of comparable size and complexity, as well as experience with other US Army or DoD organizations/installations facilities operations and maintenance systems.<br><br>Written notification and supporting documentation regarding this action may be submitted in writing to: US Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C (Carl Wade), P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-0001 or carl.m.wade@usace.army.mil.  Responses must be received by (1 March 2012) 15 calendar days of publication of this synopsis. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided. A solicitation is not available. <br><br>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: The NASA Langley-developed system provides both structural support and thermal protectionattributes in a fail safe manner. This innovation incorporates the use of a PCPcomposite structure that when overheated or exposed to fire or plasma will convert to aceramic matrix composite (CMC), retaining structural integrity and still functioningeffectively. When damage causes the thermal protection system (TPS) to fail, theunderlying PCP structure converts to a CMC material that has high-temperature structuralproperties, will not catch fire or melt, and continues to perform its structuralfunction. The system can be used in a variety of vehicles and static structures, such asincorporation into a building to keep it structurally sound during a fire. Used in are-entry heat shield, it costs less to produce than current heat shield systems. Thetechnology also has applicability to engines in general aviation aircraft, turbines,automobiles, or other ground vehicles.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS MODIFICATION WILL BE PROCURED ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS UNDER AN EXISTING INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE NIST CENTER FOR NEUTRON RESEARCH (NCNR).
<p>This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>
<p>Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 10478was awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on September 23, 2010, in the amount of $4,663,448.08. The period of performance is September 27, 2010, through February 15, 2012.</p>
<p>Description of Services<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/NCNR reactor is equipped with a thermal shield. This radiation shield consists of steel and lead that has to be water cooled in order to be kept at a temperature where it does not change shape under its own weight. Over the many years of usage the thermal shield plumbing has developed tiny leaks, which are impossible to repair.</p>
<p>Work under this task order requires the fabrication of, <br />installation of and training for the upgrade of the thermal shield plumbing system whereby the cooling water is administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure as in the present mechanical configuration.</p>
<p>The task order was awarded on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii).</p>
<p>Modification 0005 will be executed to extend the period of performance through March 15, 2012 to repair a software issue that was identified.</p>
<p>Pursuant to this modification, the total firm fixed price of the task order, $4,706,340.52, remains unchanged.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price order, on a sole source basis, with Jon H Sherly for the purchase of Support Service for identification and mitigation of systematic frequency offsets in Primary Frequency Standards based on cesium hyperfine transitions.under other than full and open competition.
<p>NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(2) Only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: Dr. Shirley is a world expert (arguably THE world expert) on the theories of various systematic frequency offsets in primary frequency standards. Dr. Shirley's expertise is critical to the continued operation and improvement of NIST-F1, the US primary frequency standard and to the introduction of NIST-F2, NIST-F1's replacement. There are no other contractors with greater or equivalent specialized expertise. He is the only known source that meets all the technical requirements of the requiring activity. As a result, Dr. Shirley is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.<br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541690 Other Scintific and Technical Consulting Services, the size standard is $7M</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.

<SOLNBR>DE-AC55-07NA25750 
<ARCHDATE>02152013
<CONTACT>Phillip Kirby, Contracting officer, Phone 865-574-3233, Email kirbypm@yso.doe.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION .<br />The United States Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Y-12 Site Office intends to award a sole source modification to existing contract DE-AC55-07NA25750 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1), to G4S Government Solutions (G4S GS), 7121 Fairway Drive, Suite 301, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33418-3766 for continued protective force support services at the NNSA Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12 NSC). The current G4S GS contract is scheduled to expire on Jun 3, 2012. The proposed modification will be for a 180 day extension and include an option to incrementally extend services up to six months thereafter, if needed. The modification will ensure the continuation of vital services of the existing contract to a new competitively awarded five-year contract currently being solicited by the NNSA Business Services Division (BSD) (Request for Proposal number TBD). The BSD anticipates an award of the follow-on contract by Sept 30, 2012, and will include a two month transition period after award. These dates, however, are subject to change.
<p>G4S GS, by virtue of being the incumbent contractor, is the only responsible source for the modification to extend the current contract. The execution of the modification will prevent any potential adverse impact to the mission of the agency, which would occur in the event of interruption or disruption of the work presently being performed. The national security mission of YSO requires the site to maintain and administer a highly specialized, extremely focused, intensive, efficient and effective security protection program. The incumbent G4S GS provides highly trained Security Police Officers and Special Response Teams to protect national nuclear weapons assets and manage the security alarm systems for the protection of a Category I Special Nuclear Material (SNM) facility at the Y-12 NSC, and has the appropriate high level security clearances to perform this work. To attempt to do a stop-gap short-term contract to cover these requirements pending the award of the follow-on five-year contract is not feasible because the three-tiered transition (from incumbent to short-term contractor to follow-on contractor) within a span of a six month period would potentially disrupt the protection of the site to an extent that would put national security at risk.</p>
<p>The statement of work under the modification is to remain the same as under the current contract. G4S GS will continue to provide mission critical protective force support services for the protection of nuclear weapons and their components from acts of sabotage or other malevolent acts at YSO during the extension period. These services include the physical protection of, Special Nuclear Material (SNM), Stockpile Stewardship Operations and Vital Equipment, classified and sensitive information, property and unclassified facilities. Continuous protective services are required 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The applicable NAICS code is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, with a size standard of $18.5M.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a modification under the current contract and is not a request for quotes or proposals and no solicitation is forthcoming. The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement by March 2, 2012, 2:00 P.M. Eastern Time, to Mr. Phil Kirby, Contracting Officer, National Nuclear Security Administration, Y-12 Site Office , PO Box 2050, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 37831, or by e-mail at kirbypm@yso.doe.gov. Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not harm security interests of the YSO. NNSA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this Notice. This Notice in no way obligates the Government to award any modifications to the existing contract.</p>

<DESC>SOLICITATION F3QCCL1227A003 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ)
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. F3QCCL1227A003.</p>
<p><br />SERVICES REQUIREMENTS:<br />CLIN 0001- Request non-personal service for one-time service contract for all parts, tools, labor, and transportation to install liquid nitrogen piping IAW statement of work dated 26 Oct 2011.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002- CDRL A001 IAW attached DD Form 1423-1 for all ACAD drawings pertaining to this install that shall become the property of the Government.</p>

<p>SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD:<br />(a) NAICS: 238220<br />(b) Dollars: $14,000,000.00</p>
<p>For this requirement, only new equipment will satisfy the government's needs. No other equipment condition will be acceptable.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to:</p>
<p>TSgt James Kaari (james.kaari@robins.af.mil) - no later than Monday, 30 January 2012 at 3:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>This requirement is sole source to the following company:<br />Quality Cryogenics of Atlanta, LLC<br />Cage 1DSR2</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source: A new ESS chamber has been purchased. It is necessary to reduce the possibility of leakage due to manufacturing differences among multiple vendors. Quality Cryogenics installed the primary system in the 2005-2006 time range and is considered a priority vendor for modifications to the existing LN2 system. The new vacuum jacketed piping will service and connect to this primary system. The interface between the existing piping and the new piping will be made with a Bayonet connector. When connecting piping with the same vendor, the closest tolerance fits possible will improve the quality of the installation and reduce the possibility of a failure. The existing connections are made using Quality Cryogenics' proprietary bayonet connector. They must use this proprietary connector to interface with their existing piping, which is why we must use Quality Cryogenics for this work.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br><br>US Army Communications-Electronics Lifecycle Management Command (C-E LCMC), Software Engineering Center (SEC), Fires Software Engineering Division (FSED) was appraised and received a Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Maturity Level 3 rating in December 2008.  To maintain the FSED Maturity Level 3 rating, SEI requires that appraisals be conducted with SEI partners following the Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI) every three years.   The SCAMPI is designed to provide benchmark-quality ratings relative to Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) models.<br>The scope of the appraisal will include all major projects at the FSED, to include the Software Development Contractor and Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) contractor organizations. The Organization's Set of Standard Processes (OSSP) is integrated processes and includes roles and responsibilities for both the government and contractor organizations.  The Fires Software Engineering Division is the principle organizational entity being assessed.  This includes the SEC, FSED, 50 Government employees, and the portions of the Software Development Contractor, 350 employees, and the IV &V Contractor, 55 employees that support the FSED. The appraisal will focus on the Tactical Weapon Systems at the FSED.   Seven projects fall within the scope of the appraisal.  FSED has identified 3 proposed projects that will be recommended for assessment.  These projects were selected because they accurately represent the software development process in existence at Fort Sill, have the longest expected future, and have the greatest number of completed developments since the advent of the FSED formal process improvement program. For FSED, the selected 3 projects constitute approximately 54% of the effort expended in the organization and 64% of the Full-Time Equivalent personnel.  Specific project details will be provided following contract award.  <br><br>The SCAMPI is designed to provide benchmark quality ratings relative to Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) models. The SCAMPI Method Definition Document (MDD) describes the requirements, activities, and practices associated with the processes that compose the SCAMPI method. <br>Results of the appraisal activities will allow the organization to obtain a Maturity Level rating of current process capability and gain insight for continued process improvement. FSED is prepared to move forward with appraisal activities; therefore the work can start as soon as the contract award is made.   <br>

                            (End of Clause)
 
 
 C.2 52.236-2 DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS (APR 1984)
 
   (a) The Contractor shall promptly, and before the conditions are disturbed, give a written notice to the Contracting Officer of (1) subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site which differ materially from those indicated in this contract, or (2) unknown physical conditions at the site, of an unusual nature, which differ materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inhering in work of the character provided for in the contract.
 
   (b) The Contracting Officer shall investigate the site conditions promptly after receiving the notice.  If the conditions do materially so differ and cause an increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, performing any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed as a result of the conditions, an equitable adjustment shall be made under this clause and the contract modified in writing accordingly.
 
   (c) No request by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment to the contract under this clause shall be allowed, unless the Contractor has given the written notice required; provided, that the time prescribed in (a) above for giving written notice may be extended by the Contracting Officer.
 
   (d) No request by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment to the contract for differing site conditions shall be allowed if made after final payment under this contract.
 
                            (End of Clause)
 
 C.3 VAAR 852.203-70 COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING (JAN 2008)
 
   The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.
 
                              (End of Clause)
 
 C.4 VAAR 852.211-70 SERVICE DATA MANUALS (NOV 1984)
 
   (a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.
 
   (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number.

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(2)	Rules, regulations, directions, and requirements which are issued by command authorities under their responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the installation, or who travel on Government transportation.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

With the recent award of 15 BPAs of Office Supplies in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) and to best allocate government resources, GSA temporarily postponed Schedule 75 to new Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) offers for 24 months, effective October 1, 2010. At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program. 

*This solicitation continues to be postponed to new offers.

GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored. 

Questions regarding postponement:

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

However, as a clear indicator of vendor's intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee. Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the Contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.

Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 September of each government fiscal year and must be reported by 31 October of each calendar year.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quotation (RFQ) number W912LP-12-Q-0003.  All proposals shall reference the RFQ number and shall be submitted by 11:00 a.m. local (central) time on 16 March 2012. The anticipated award date is 23 March 2012. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-55, Correction II, dated 25 January 2012.  This acquisition is open for 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611519 size standard of $7.0m. Contract line item numbers and quantities: CLIN 0001, Base Period (FY 12) for Patrol Officers Response to Street Drugs, seven course iterations; CLIN 0002, CMR Reporting for Base Year (FY 12); CLIN 0003, Option Year #1 (FY 13) for Patrol Officers Response to Street Drugs, seven course iterations; CLIN 0004, CMR Reporting for Option Year #1 (FY 13); CLIN 0005, Option Year #2 (FY 14) for Patrol Officers Response to Street Drugs, seven course iterations; CLIN 0006, CMR Reporting for Option Year #2 (FY 14); CLIN 0007, Option Year #3 (FY 15) for Patrol Officers Response to Street Drugs, seven course iterations; CLIN 0008, CMR Reporting for Option Year #3 (FY 15); CLIN 0009, Option Year #4 (FY 16) for Patrol Officers Response to Street Drugs, seven course iterations; CLIN 0010, CMR Reporting for Option Year #4 (FY 16); Vendors shall review the Statement of Work for a detailed list of course requirements and items to be submitted as part of their proposal.  The prices provided for each of the CLINS above shall include all labor, material, travel costs, supervision, and associated services to carry out the Midwest Counterdrug Training Center's (MCTC) mission requirements as defined in the Statement of Work. Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR); the vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendor's intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee. Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the Contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The Contractor is required to completely fill in all the information in the format using the following web address: https://cmra.army.mil. The required information includes: (1) Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative; (2) Contract number, including task and delivery order number; (3) Beginning and ending dates covered by reporting period; (4) Contractor name, address, phone number, e-mail address, identity of Contractor employee entering data; (5) Estimated direct labor hours (including sub-Contractors); (6) Estimated direct labor dollars paid this reporting period (including sub-Contractors); (7) Total payments (including sub-Contractors); (8) Predominant Federal Service Code (FSC) reflecting services provided by Contractor (and separate predominant FSC for each sub-Contractor if different); (9) Estimated data collection costs; (10) Organizational title associated with the Unit Identification Code (UIC) for the Army Requiring Activity (the Army Requiring Activity is responsible for providing the Contractor with its UIC for the purposes of reporting this information); (11) Locations where Contractor and sub-Contractors perform the work (specified by zip code in the United States and nearest city, country, when in an overseas location, using standardized nomenclature provided on website); (12) Presence of deployment or contingency contract language; and (13) Number of contractor and sub-contractor employees deployed in theater this reporting period (by country). As part of its submission, the Contractor will also provide the estimated total cost (if any) incurred to comply with this reporting requirement.  Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 September of each government fiscal year and must be reported by 31 October of each calendar year.   Contractors may use a direct XML data transfer to the database server or fill in the fields on the website. The XML direct transfer is a format for transferring files from a contractor's systems to the secure website without the need for separate data entries for each required data element at the website. The specific formats for the XML direct transfer may be downloaded from the website. The CMRA web site maintains a "Frequently Asked Questions and Answers" https://cmra.army.mil/ that is updated periodically.  Any technical or implementation questions not addressed on this site can be discussed and coordinated through the CMR Help Desk at 703-377-6199, or https://cmra.army.mil. IMPORTANT!!!

<p><br />Solicitation Number<br />DTNH22-12-Q-00147</p>
<p>Presolicitation: Synopsis</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA" or "the agency") is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). As part of NHTSA's mission, the agency has been issuing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) for the last thirty years. EPCA requires the agency to establish average fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks at "the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretary [of DOT] decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year." The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) was enacted on December 19, 2007 and amended EPCA by mandating, in addition to passenger car and light truck standards being set at the maximum feasible level in each model year, that the model year (MY) 2011-2020 CAFE standards be set sufficiently high to ensure that the industry-wide average of all new passenger cars and light trucks, combined, is not less than 35 miles per gallon (mpg) by MY 2020. In fulfillment of its EPCA and EISA requirements, and in response to President Obama's request to create a coordinated and harmonized National Program for motor vehicle efficiency and emissions standards, NHTSA recently published a joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set CAFE standards under EPCA/EISA and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) standards under the Clean Air Act for passenger cars and light trucks manufactured in model years 2017-2025. Based on public information and information NHTSA gathered about how vehicle manufacturers plan to comply with CAFE standards in those model years, the agency anticipates that the industry will make use of vehicle mass reduction as a means for reducing vehicle fuel consumption in the future.</p>
<p>This synopsis seeks to acquire technical experts in the fields of light-duty vehicle light-weighting and material application, safety analysis, and automotive technology costing to peer-review the report and models. Over the past year, the agency tasked a contractor team to complete a design, validation, and cost estimate for a light-weighted Honda Accord, including a finite element analysis (FEA) model and a cost model. The current version of the draft report to be peer reviewed is just over 400 pages in length, including all tables and appendices.</p>
<p>The agency asks peer reviewers to examine both the underlying assumptions in the analysis as well as the veracity of the conclusions based on the assumptions, the analysis, and the available data.</p>
<p>The study covers areas of advanced material properties and usage, joining techniques, vehicle structure design and optimization, manufacturing processes, bending and torsion tests, NVH simulations, vehicle durability simulations, full vehicle crash simulation, and manufacturing cost estimation. NHTSA plans to select reviewers from a diverse background of industry, academia, and government experience to review all aspects of the study, with emphasis on the sources of information, methods employed, crash simulation testing techniques, and the estimated costs for the potential of mass-reduction technology in the 2017-2025 timeframe. NHTSA is seeking reviewers' expert opinion on the technologies utilized, methodologies employed, and validity of findings regarding this study.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Subpart 13 award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis from who submits a responsive offer. Multiple awards will be awarded from this solicitation.</p>

<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516.</p>
<p>The Energy and Environment Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a reference material to improve the reliability of chemical emissions measurements from building products.</p>
<p>A heated micro-sized chamber system will give the group the capability to make rapid measurements of organic chemical emissions from building materials, which will extend the capabilities of our small chamber testing system. Micro-chamber systems are a recently developed technology that are being adopted by industry and testing laboratories for quality control screening of emissions of volatile organic chemicals, semi-volatile organic chemicals and formaldehyde content of materials. As a result, several standards are being developed regarding the use of micro-chamber technology. NIST requires a micro-chamber system that consists of multiple heated chambers, in multiple sizes less than 150 mL, with integrated gas control that allows for the measurement of different types of chemicals. These unique features are essential for allowing the division to match current industry measurements and giving us the flexibility to simultaneously test several samples at different conditions. Below are the detailed specifications required:</p>

<DESC>National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Helping to lead the way toward important medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives, NIH scientists investigate ways to prevent disease as well as the causes, treatments, and even cures for common and rare diseases. Composed of 27 institutes and centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in all fifty states and throughout the world.
<p>The Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, is the nation's largest hospital devoted entirely to clinical research. It is a national resource that makes it possible to rapidly translate scientific observations and laboratory discoveries into new approaches for diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease. Approximately 1,500 studies are in progress at the NIH Clinical Center. About half the studies are the first tests of new drugs or medical treatments in people. The rest are natural history studies of diseases-including many rare diseases. These long-term studies lead to better understanding of how diseases develop and to improvements in prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>The Biomedical Engineering and Property Management Section (BEIP) manages the maintenance, calibration, safety, and performance monitoring of clinical and nonclinical equipment and ensures that all clinical equipment meets regulatory agency(s) regulations and industry standards.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Midgette, (252) 335-6943, Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

EVALUATION FACTORS
See Attachment 1, PWS.
   The following is incorporated in full text into FAR 52.212-2:
 (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
1. Business and Technical Capability.   This section includes the technical and business approach as well as staffing and management and shall clearly articulate how the Offeror will meet the requirements in the Description/Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The response shall be specific, detailed, and comprehensive enough to enable technical personnel to make a thorough evaluation of its content.
  All proposed performance under the resulting task order shall be mapped to the PWS elements in the PWS (e.g., 2.1.1, 2.1.2).  Unless stipulated, resumes and other supporting materials beyond the 12 page limitation are discretionary.  Proposals shall be evaluated on their compliance with the technical specifications and understanding of system supportability and training requirements.  Offerors shall specifically address their ability to meet the Governments required delivery schedule.  See Attachment 3.
	2. Past Performance.  Proposals shall be evaluated on the level of risk posed by the	Offerors past performance history.  Offerors shall be evaluated for their experience with	projects similar in relevancy and scope in the past three (3) years.

3.
 Price. A total evaluated price for each Offeror will be calculated by summing the extended unit price for each CLIN.   Provide a breakout of participating team members (i.e. labor), associated schedules, discount, discounted rates, travel, and Other Direct Costs (ODC) necessary to support your technical approach, mapped to the appropriate PWS element (e.g., 2.1.1, 2.1.2).  Provide any discount that you intend to apply to your total pricing.  Additionally, propose a payment schedule that corresponds with the period of performance and your desired CLIN structure.  Example:  90 day period of performance, labor $200,000 and Travel $ 2,000.00 and ODCs $10,000.
  (b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.
 The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>After completion of Washington training, the Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) may be assigned to Washington, other locations in the United States, or an overseas office, and will be required to serve through rotational assignments. At any time, at the discretion of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Headquarters, the incumbent may be reassigned/relocated to a geographical location where the individual's services are needed.</p>
<p>Applicants for the HAA/M position must be willing to be posted at any location. The potential posts are listed as follows, but the location of service could be ultimately determined by the location of future unknown operational requirements. OFDA currently has established relationships with the Department of Defense's (DoD) Combatant Commands (COCOM) in Miami, Florida; Honolulu, Hawaii; Tampa, Florida; and Stuttgart, Germany, where there is an OFDA operational need to work with the military independent of future country specific disasters. The OFDA strategic plan also calls for assignment of HAA/Ms in Washington, D.C.; Bangkok, Thailand; San Jose, Costa Rica; Okinawa, Japan; and Manama, Bahrain.</p>
<p>Initial post assignments will be based on each applicant's understanding of USAID/OFDA and the humanitarian assistance environment, each applicant's background (i.e., language, regional experience, etc.), and available post vacancies at the time of award.</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. OPS performs these functions through several teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team and the Military Liaison Team (MLT). The MLT provides technical assistance and guidance, military liaison and consequence management of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear or Explosive (CBRNE) events. It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of MLT and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:charnis.boardsbailey@us.army.mil">ACC-RSA - (Aviation)</a>
<DESC>W58RGZ-PM-UAS-UMS<br>QUESTION and ANSWER<br><br>QUESTION 1: Question concerning RFI requirement #3.<br><br>Item 3 reads "Potential Respondents shall describe proposed financial plans, including, if appropriate, the manner in which charges levied for services rendered would be derived.  Charges cannot be based on cost plus a percentage of cost."<br>We would like some clarification on what you would like us to include in the response.<br><br>For instance, one approach might be to say that the company has established GSA PES rates which will be used to bill labor costs based upon a proposed mix of personnel required to perform work under a RFQ.  It would be anticipated that all responses would be based upon these rates and any material or subcontract costs would be billed at cost plus material handling without fee.<br><br>Another approach might be to say, the company anticipates bidding on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee basis on any RFQ.  Labor costs will be quoted based upon an average labor cost for each type of labor classification required.  Material, travel and subcontract costs will be identified separately and properly burdened.   Standard overhead, general and administrative, and fees will be applied to appropriate cost elements for proposal and billing purposes.<br><br>Another approach might be, the company will propose new labor categories and develop a matrix of current and future employees that it anticipates will be required to perform on this contract.  The labor costs associated with the new T&M labor categories developed for this contract will be burdened with appropriate overhead, general and administrative, and fees to arrive at a billing rate.  Material, travel and subcontract costs will be identified separately and properly burdened for proposal and billing purposes.<br><br>Is this the type of information you are expecting in the response or are you seeking something broader in terms of the "financial plans"?<br><br>ANSWER 1: Respondents should provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate, based on past experience and the areas presented in this RFI.  The ROM should cover all expected resources to include labor, materials, etc.  The ROM should list any assumptions made, and may be based on a phased approach for implementation.

<DESC>W58RGZ-PMUASFLEET<br>QUESTIONS and ANSWERS<br><br>NOTE:   If a contractor submits proprietary information under this RFI, the contractor must execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) between themselves and the support contractors listed in the RFI. A signed copy of the NDA agreements must be furnished to the Government with the response submission.  Contractors are hereby advised that they are accountable for marking their submissions appropriately.<br><br>QUESTION 1:  The RFI that was released does not have any instructions for preparing an RFI response.  Do you have any instructions on what needs to be included along with the format of the RFI?<br><br>ANSWER 1:  No specific format is required; however, the Government will accept Rough Order-of-Magnitude (ROM) estimates.<br><br>QUESTION 2:  The RFI states "Under the auspices of the Universal Operator Concept, outlined in the UAS Training Strategy,..."  Do you have a copy of a link to the UAS Training Strategy and any additional information on the Universal Operator Concept?<br><br>ANSWER 2:  The UAS Training Strategy is not necessary to prepare a response to the <br>Request for Information UAS Training - W58RGZ-PMUASFLEET, In addition, it is not available for release at this time.<br><br>QUESTION 3:  Is a white paper format satisfactory?<br><br>ANSWER 3: Yes.<br><br>QUESTION 4:  I noticed that FBO provides a link to additional information, but the link is not hooked up to a specific web address and therefore not working.  Can you please send me the web address that provides further content?<br><br>ANSWER 4:  Under Additional Info: The Department of Army, Program Manager - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PM-UAS) was linked by error.  There is no additional information for this RFI.<br><br>QUESTION 5:  Can the response be submitted electronically, and if so, to what email address, etc.<br><br>ANSWER 5: Yes.  It can be emailed to Charnis.BoardsBailey@us.army.mil<br><br>QUESTION 6:  What is the response page limit, if any? <br><br>ANSWER 6:  There is no page limit.<br><br>QUESTION 7:  What is the current benchmark for the 15% reduction to be realized in training effort?<br><br>            A.  How many instructors are currently used in the 40 weeks of training for UAS operators?  <br><br>            B.  Is there a minimum student to instructor ratio?<br><br>            C.  What facilities (buildings, simulators, devices, etc.) are currently used?<br><br>            D.  Is all the training currently conducted at Ft. Huachuca or do mobile training teams or distributed training network provide refresher training in units?  <br><br>            E.  Have the common elements from the 3 POIs (Shadow, Gray Eagle, and Hunter) already been identified and has the Universal Operator content already be identified?  <br><br>ANSWER 7: Understand that this assumes that your company is "king-for-a-day."  And if given that opportunity, how would you train UAS operators using state-of-the-art technologies (if applicable) or any other means at your disposal?  Providing all this information is not relevant.  Your approach should be telling the Government how and what your company would use in the training of UAS operators. <br><br>QUESTION 8:  Does this RFI pertain only to UAV operation, or is maintenance also included? <br><br>ANSWER 8: Same answer as ANSWER 7.<br><br>QUESTION 9:  Could you clarify the "applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures" mentioned in   the RFI under the Scope section.  Other than air space and NATO interoperability standards, what are these?<br><br>ANSWER 9:  As a company that would provide these services, this should already be known.<br><br>QUESTION 10: The point of contact for Aerodyne, Inc. is Bobby Reynolds, Lead Associate (UAS TADSS Development & Support Analyst) and his phone number is listed as (259) 842-1091; however, that is a hotel number.

<DESC>*** This Amendment to Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) Reference Number W31P4Q-12-R-0074 extends the response date to March 08, 2012. ***<br><br><br><br>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898 on behalf of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile Systems (PFRMS) Project Office, Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, hereby issues the following Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) to ascertain the level of interest of potential vendors desiring to contract for the development and production of an improved Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rocket. This RFI is released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e).  Interested sources will provide a white paper describing their recommended strategies. Responses must be in compliance with all applicable Army, DoD and Federal policies. <br><br>Requirement Statement:<br>The desired improvements in a next generation GMLRS rocket are: <br>-	Increase the maximum range from the current capability up to 250 km with minimal impact on the current minimum range capability of 15 km. A minimum of two missiles per launcher pod is desired.  Range, number of missiles per pod, and warhead weight are the major performance characteristics to be considered.  Performance and system cost are of equal importance.<br><br>-	Using a single warhead, provide scalable lethality effects equivalent to high explosive blast/fragment warheads ranging from 50 lb to 250 lb of high explosive.  <br><br>o	This desired lethality capability will permit engagement of both point targets and/or wide area targets. The desire is a warhead capable of meeting both GMLRS and TACMS point and imprecisely located targets. <br><br>o	This lethality will be selectable in discreet increments either in the Fire Mission Digital Message or by the Fire Control Panel Operator on the launcher.  <br><br>-	This warhead will have the capability to operate in a proximity mode, point detonation mode, or time delay after impact mode. <br><br>-	The rockets will be housed within a Launch Pod Container (LPC).  The physical dimensions of the LPC (i.e. height, width, length and weight), as well as the mechanical interface, must be compatible with the current M270 series, M142 launchers and existing logistical assets.  The LPC must be usable with the current family of launchers to avoid the cost of developing new launchers and to avoid costly changes to current logistical/material handling equipment.<br><br>-	Rocket time of flight from launch to target engagement will be consistent with current MFOM (MLRS Family of Munitions) rockets; with no greater than 10 percent degradation.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses and/or small disadvantaged businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, concerns owned by an Indian tribe, Alaska Native Corporation and women-owned small business) that have the capability to support CMS' Data Privacy Safeguard Program (DPSP).</p>
<p>History: In July 2011, CMS established the DPSP to ensure the protection of CMS data that are disclosed to external organizations for research purposes. The DPSP reflects the agency's priorities to both improve data stewardship and to protect the privacy and security of CMS' research identifiable files (RIF), which are disclosed for relevant research studies. The program is supported through a contract with CMS.</p>
<p>One of the primary objectives of the DPSP is to provide guidance to external organizations on how to implement effective, reasonable, and appropriate measures that protect CMS RIFs. The DPSP leverages the resources of the Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC), a CMS contractor that provides free assistance to academic, government and other researchers interested in using Medicare and/or Medicaid data for their research. <br /><br />The DPSP consists of monitoring, by remote and/or on-site review, compliance with the privacy and security protections as described in the organization's data management plan (DMP). The DMP is a section of the researcher's protocol that is submitted to CMS, along with a signed data use agreement and contains additional details about the safeguards researchers have in place to protect CMS RIFs. The information provided includes information about the organizations' administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.</p>
<p>The potential contractor will be expected to use the researcher's DMP submission as the basis for its review. It will review the DMP submission and evaluate whether the researcher has explained and documented the privacy policies and procedures it has in place to protect CMS RIFs. Ultimately, the DPSP provides CMS the opportunity to review external organizations' DMPs and make informed decisions on future data requests. For general information about the program, please visit the "What's New" section on the ResDAC home page: http://www.resdac.org/. <br /><br />Contractor Requirements:</p>

<p>2. A working understanding of NIST/FISMA requirements to safeguard personally identifiable and protected health information.</p>
<p>3. Conduct approximately 20 remote and/or on-site reviews using previously developed materials.

<p>4. Provide ongoing technical support to external organizations about the information needed to successfully submit a DMP.</p>
<p>5. Evaluate approximately 200 DMPs, including identifying deficiencies and areas for improvement per criteria.</p>

It is uniquely qualified, given this background experience, to provide detailed and effective code site inspections for the RTI construction. Based on this role during design, C-West carries the professional liability of having certified that the design of the facility meets code requirements. As such, carrying out inspections during the construction of the design to ensure its continued compliance with applicable building codes is a natural extension of services already rendered, much like the Architect-Engineer of record carrying out Supervision, Inspection and Overhead (SIOH) services during construction. There are no other known sources that can provide the services that are unique to this requirement in the required timeframe. All interested sources must respond not later than 17 February 2012, 1000 hours MST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses should be emailed to Nicole Jensen at Nicole.jensen@us.army.mil. For any additional details please contact Nicole Jensen @ 720-847-8679.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), proposes to extend task order GS-23F-9755H/ HSHQDC-09-F-00004 for 3 months on a basis of other than full and open competition for Business Operations Support, Facilities Management Support, and NPPD Training Support Services.
<p>Task order GS-23F-9755H/HSHQDC-09-F-00004 was awarded to Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) on January 30, 2009 with a 4 month base period and 3 option periods of 1 year each. The total award amount including options is $20,010,145.35.</p>
<p>DHS has a requirement on a limited source basis to provide continued services while in the process of hiring federal employees at an estimated cost of $726,290.40. The 3 month extension is through May 7, 2012.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, "Limiting sources." In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is that only one source is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services are unique or highly specialized. The current task order was competitively solicited and awarded and the modification to extend services is necessary to prevent a gap in services while the positions are being converted to Federal positions. Additionally, the Government needs BAH to transition out as federal employees transition in over the 3 month period. Transition to a new contractor for this short duration would involve disruptive transition efforts, personnel security clearance processing, and a need to brief and indoctrinate new contractor personnel. The time and expense associated with a new contractor would be cost prohibitive. No other company except BAH can provide transition services except BAH as the services provided are unique to BAH.</p>

Shooter and target adjudication based on dynamic events must occur within the time of flight of simulated munitions to provide a realistic training environment.  Understanding the network topologies, infrastructure, mobility, scalability and minimum latencies achievable for a complete communications loop between shooter, target(s) and the Instrumentation System will help the government evolve various use case solutions for short time of flight weapons.  Further, contractors are asked to address the additional network throughput demands and Quality of Service (QoS) of this "peer to peer or peer to peer like" network use case.  Additionally, what is the ability of the communications network and radio to support near real time communications allowing for remote command and control of Training Aids, Devices, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS) such as IED simulators and range effects devices?<br><br><br>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.<br>

2.  Method:  	a. Researched equipment needed
	        	b. Conducted Internet and local search
		c. Justification 
d. Posted Sources Sought Notice 
			
3.  The research requires the latest technology specifically for research, GE MR750s.  According to General Electric Healthcare there are only two of these in the San Diego area and both are at UCSD. On 12/20/11, Carl L. Linsz, Regional Product Manager of MR equipment from General Electric Healthcare, was contacted in order to get the most up-to-date information.  According to Mr. Linsz, the are only two GE MR750s south of Camp Pendleton.  Also, the Center for Functional MRI is the ONLY research fMRI center within walking distance from the VA Hospital.



4.  Internet search in the local area for the specific FMRI equipment that will fulfill the need. There is one additional MRI facility at UCSD's Sorrento Valley location which is dedicated to research only.  However, the MRI is 1.5 Tesla, providing lower quality scans.  A review of all major academic centers in the San Diego area was conducted.  None of these institutions has an MRI; in fact, all of the scientists wishing to conduct MRI research locally go to the UCSD Center for Functional MRI for their services.  The institutions contacted were San Diego State University, The Salk Institute, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology, and the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute.   This was also confirmed on 12/20/11 with Carl L. Linsz, Regional Product Manager of MR Equipment from GE Healthcare.  He has first-hand knowledge of all research-use MRIs in San Diego.  Also, the Center for Functional MRI is the ONLY research fMRI center within walking distance from the VA Hospital

5.  A notice was posted on FBO to look for alternative sources and inform the public of this sole source contract.  No response was received providing the ability to offer this service.  

Conclusion:
The market research was thorough accordingly a sole source will be given to University of California San Diego (UCSD)  for  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRIs) for research.

<DESC>It is the government's intent to&nbsp;extend&nbsp;task order&nbsp;FA8823-11-F-0001&nbsp;two weeks to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in accordance with&nbsp;Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This extension&nbsp;is necessary to continue to meet mission critical requirements, mitigate the impact of personnel turnover, and to support transition to competitively award a&nbsp;follow-on task order. The period of performance for this extension is 1 January 2012 through 13 January 2012. This sole source extension is strictly for the continuation of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS)&nbsp;to the Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Logistics Directorate&nbsp; and related space organizations. This&nbsp; extension will support the Air Force's immediate need to bridge a gap in service from the end of the current A&amp;AS task order which expires 31 December 2011 and award of the follow-on task order. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals. As stated above, the Air Force intends to award the two-week extension described herein to the incumbent contractor.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies, located in Washington, D.C. to participate as a member in IOM's Forum on Microbial Threats . <br />USU intends on awarding an option year contract with a base period of one (1) year with four (4) one year options. The performance period of the base year is February 01, 2012 through January 31, 2013.<br /><br />This membership will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br />6.302-3 Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services<br />(2) Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order- <br />(ii) To establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center
<p>The University will be represented on the Forum on Microbial Threats (the Forum), a convened activity of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. In this context, the University will play a role in the development of key in-depth reviews of urgent and time-relevant infectious disease threats facing the US and the larger world community.<br /><br />Each organization that supports the Forum derives access to up-to-date scientific data and key thought leaders throughout the public debates and private consultations that occur regularly throughout the year. As a supporter of the Forum, the University is expected to provide a representative knowledgeable in infectious diseases and the public health threats associated with these diseases. As with all supporters of the Forum, the University's representative will have the opportunity to shape the discussions, debate,<br />and final reports through regular and engaged involvement in the Forum's activities.<br /><br />The Forum on Microbial Threats is a convened activity of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. There are no other offerors elsewhere who convene a similar activity.</p>
<p>Participation in this activity is only possible through the Institute of Medicine.</p>
<p>In its medical education and medical research roles, the University serves as a critical component of the MHS in terms of developing responses to emerging infectious disease threats that face the DoD. Participation in the Forum's activities will directly augment the University's capabilities in this area and in doing so, will assist the University in its larger DoD mission.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals and a solicitation package will not be issued. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be received via email (micreenan@usuhs.mil) by 9:00 a.m. EST on March 17, 2012.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), proposes to extend task order GS-23F-9755H/ HSHQDC-09-F-00004 for 3 months on a basis of other than full and open competition for Business Operations Support, Facilities Management Support, and NPPD Training Support Services.
<p>Task order GS-23F-9755H/HSHQDC-09-F-00004 was awarded to Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) on January 30, 2009 with a 4 month base period and 3 option periods of 1 year each. The total award amount including options is $20,010,145.35.</p>
<p>DHS has a requirement on a limited source basis to provide continued services while in the process of hiring federal employees at an estimated cost of $726,290.40. The 3 month extension is through May 7, 2012.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, "Limiting sources." In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is that only one source is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services are unique or highly specialized. The current task order was competitively solicited and awarded and the modification to extend services is necessary to prevent a gap in services while the positions are being converted to Federal positions. Additionally, the Government needs BAH to transition out as federal employees transition in over the 3 month period. Transition to a new contractor for this short duration would involve disruptive transition efforts, personnel security clearance processing, and a need to brief and indoctrinate new contractor personnel. The time and expense associated with a new contractor would be cost prohibitive. No other company except BAH can provide transition services except BAH as the services provided are unique to BAH.</p>

<FOJA>Follow-on Delivery Order Following Competitive Initial Order
<AWDNBR>GS-35F-0844N
<DONBR>HSHQDC-12-F-00021
<DESC><p>Synopsis:<br /><br />Limited Sources Justification<br /><br />1. Agency and Contracting Activity<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO). <br /><br />2. Nature and/or Description of the Action being Approved<br /><br />The purpose of this task order is to provide program management support services for Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) program operations. This Task Order is a follow-on Task Order to ensure the continuity of the aforementioned services while a follow-on requirement (solicitation HSHQDC-11-R-00144) is competed, and will replace expiring task order HSHQDC-06-J-00418. The follow-on requirement solicited under HSHQDC-11-R-00144 is planned for award in April 2012. The period of performance for the task order contract is 90 days, and funds are available. The total estimated amount of the Task Order for the 90-day period of performance is $949,186.00.<br /><br />3. Description of Supplies/Services<br /><br />The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) is the primary and predominate secure communication and collaboration system that supports the unified effort to prevent and deter terrorist attacks, and prepare for and respond to any natural or manmade disaster. The contractor shall provide program management support services to the DHS Office of Applied Technology (OAT) within the Chief Information Officer (CIO) organization responsible for managing HSIN. The services provided through this contract will allow the CIO to meet the DHS HSIN goals and objectives. It has been determined that Blackstone Technology Group is the only contractor that can provide these services without disruptions or delays in current services, and that can ensure a seamless continuation of mission support prior to award of the follow on contract solicited under HSHQDC-11-R-00144. <br /><br />4. Identification of the Justification and Rationale<br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-6 Limiting Sources. In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), in the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order that was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original FSS order was competed among GSA vendors. Blackstone Technology Group was selected and their services are needed for an additional three months until the follow on contract is awarded in April 2012. Blackstone Technology Group is the only contractor that can meet critical schedules and has prior experience of a highly specialized nature vital to successfully performing this effort. <br /><br />5. Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with 8.404(d)<br /><br />The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that the anticipated prices will be fair and reasonable and represents the overall best value to the Government and will result in the lowest overall cost alternative, considering price and administrative costs, and has the lowest risk of performance to meet the Government's needs. The order will be in accordance with FAR 8.404, "Use of Federal Supply Schedules." The General Services Administration (GSA) has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing rates and GSA awarded rates will be used. Additionally, prior to issuance of the task order, the ordering activity will consider the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform the specific task being ordered in determining that the total price is reasonable.<br />&nbsp;<br />6. A Description of the Market Research Conducted among Schedule Holders and the Results of a Statement of the Reason Market Research was Not Conducted<br /><br />Market Research consisted of reviewing several schedule holders on the GSA Advantage website. However, there is no reasonable expectation that the other sources have the experience and understanding of DHS HSIN program and its core functions systems and the requisite number of TS/SCI cleared personnel to immediately fulfill the Government's needs. Also, there is no reasonable expectation that another source can ramp up to provide the services in this short period of time.<br /><br />7. Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification<br /><br />Not Applicable. <br /><br />8. A Statement of Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take To Remove or Overcome Any Barriers that Preclude the Agency from Meeting the Requirements of 8.405-1 and 8.405-2 before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services is Made<br /><br />The OPO is currently processing a follow on competitive solicitation to acquire the full scope of HSIN support services to support the HSIN program office.<br />&nbsp;<br />9. Contracting Officer's Certification<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(c)(2)(ix), I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
