ORIGIN. NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) intends to solicit the Boeing
Company (81205) for the purchase of items associated with the P-8A Poseidon
aircraft platform. NAVSUP WSS' intention is to award a Firm Fixed Price
contract. Although the Navy intends in the future to obtain competition wherever
feasible for the subject items (generally referred to as common commercial
parts), key logistics/support data essential to competition is not currently
available. Specifically, essential provisioning data and engineering/technical
data necessary for manufacture and acceptance of the subject parts (initially
developed for the 737 aircraft by Boeing Commercial Aircraft or its commercial
sub-vendors) is not available to the Navy. In addition, Critical Safety Item
(CSI)/Critical Application Item (CAI) determinations for the P-8A continue to be
made and life limits assessed, including for commercial common parts. Given such
circumstances, at present, purchases of the listed items will only be made from
Boeing the airframe manufacturer, from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs),
or from authorized distributors (if any) to assure parts integrity given the
P-8A's critical mission and early deployment status. Notwithstanding the current
constraints requiring procurement as noted, once CSI/CAI determinations are
made, and where other necessary enginee ring/technical data becomes available,
the Navy will be actively seeking in the future to maximize the opportunity for
competition presented by P-8A commercial common parts. In that regard the
following should be noted. The P-8A is not FAA type certificated. New sources
for items determined to be CSI/CAI will therefore require Navy Source Approval
prior to award. If you are not a Navy-approved source, when in the future the
Navy has sufficient engineering/technical data to accept and evaluate source
approval requests, you will have to submit, prior to or together with any
proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Brochure
which can be obtained on the internet at:
https://www.nasup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupww/business_opps. Future offers
received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure
will not be considered for award. Please note, if evaluation of a so urce
approval request submitted cannot be processed in time and/or the approval
requirement precludes the ability to obtain the items being procured in time to
meet Government requirements, award of the procurement may be continued based on
Fleet support needs. For information or questions regarding this notice, please
contact Edward Pluciennik at the email address: edward.pluciennik@navy.mil.
