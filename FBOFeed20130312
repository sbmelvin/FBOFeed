This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-13-00114 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

The intended sole source contractor is:  <br>  <br> Spectrum Comm, Inc. <br> One Compass Way <br> Suite 300 <br> Newport News, VA 23606 <br>  <br> The synchronization prototype software capability was initiated under the DARPA  quote mark Active Templates quote mark  program in the late 1990s and transitioned to a USSOCOM customer.  PEO EIS Technology Applications Office (SFAE-PS-EI-TAOC) contracted with General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GD AIS) under contract number DAAB18-03-D-5021 to develop productionized releases of the synchronization software capability.  In FY04 and FY05, the USSOCOM Mission Planning Office provided resources to enhance the synchronization software capability. <br>  <br> In FY06, the Mission Planning Office provided resources to Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) to leverage contract number H94003-04-D-0003 (GD AIS) to enhance and maintain the software and to develop an integrated capability with the Falcon View mapping application.  The period of performance for this effort ended in July 2006.  No procurement activity for this capability has been funded by the Mission Planning Office since FY06. <br>  <br> In FY05, the Office of Naval Research (ONR)/Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/ U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) started the Joint Coordinated Real-Time Engagement Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (JCRE ACTD) effort, which utilized some of the synchronization capability, ended in FY09 and this capability was transitioned to DISA.  No further efforts have been performed. <br>  <br> At this time, the Government will upgrade the software.   <br>  <br> All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number E13PS00032 for Proposed Research on Oil Spill Response Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf
DESCRIPTION:
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BSEE Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR) Program on Oil Spill Response Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research and studies.  For a summary of research recently performed, visit http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Oil-Spill-Response-Research-(OSRR).aspx. Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submission of white papers.
BACKGROUND:   
The BSEE OSRR Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Authors of selected white papers will be requested to submit full proposals.  Proposals selected for funding by BSEE may receive funding via Fiscal Year 2013 allocations. The BSEE anticipates that $6,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research and/or studies addressing topics identified through this announcement.  The BSEE does not anticipate any one award exceeding $1,000,000.  
NOTICE:  
The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE. The BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP). 
OBJECTIVES:   
Responses to the Fiscal Year 2013 (FY13) oil spill response research under this announcement should be limited to the following topics: 
1.	Development of Surrogate Oils for Oil Spill Remote Sensing Technology Testing and Training - Environmental considerations generally preclude the ability to develop/test oil spill detection and response tools in the intended operational environment with actual crude oils.  There is a need for development of environmentally friendly surrogate oils that would mimic the characteristics of crude oil for use in field testing and training.  BSEE is specifically interested in; 	A surrogate whose properties would mirror the reflective signature of crude oils for use with remote sensing technology.  This surrogate would be utilized to provide realistic testing/training for technology designed to detect/map/measure spilled oil in a marine environment. 	A surrogate that would be appropriate for use in an Arctic environment, for example oil trapped under an ice sheet.   	A surrogate that could be used to test mechanical recovery equipment in field tests, specifically in an Arctic environment. 
2.	Flow Rate Verification - There is a need for new technology that will allow for a more precise measurement of the flow rate of oil and gas during an underwater uncontrolled release.
3.	 Conducting Expanded Seasonal Testing in Simulated Arctic Environment at Ohmsett - Ohmsett, the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey, is a government owned facility.  It is the largest outdoor saltwater wave/tow tank facility in North America where full-scale oil spill response equipment testing, research, and training can be conducted with oil.  With an expanded focus on testing in simulated Arctic conditions, BSEE would like to explore expansion of Ohmsetts capabilities to allow for increased testing of oil spill equipment in various simulated arctic conditions. This project should include a needs assessment, define the current limitations of the facility, and provide a roadmap for implementation of recommendations.
4.	Innovative Technology Enhancements for Measuring Test Parameters at Ohmsett - BSEE would like to explore the possibility of enhancing the Ohmsett facility to allow for real-time measurement of test parameters such as percent of surface oil coverage, percent of surface ice coverage, and accurate ability to easily measure oil thicknesses during testing.  5.	Review of ASTM Standards for Oil Spill Response Equipment  The ASTM Committee F20 on Hazardous Substances and Oil Spill Response has developed many consensus standards that pertain to many aspects of oil spill response equipment.  A review of existing standards with a recommendation on any needed standards is desired.  This review should encompass any special considerations required for oil spill response operations in Arctic conditions and the effort could include preparation of draft documents for consideration by the F20 Committee.
6.	Assess Options for Maintaining a National Inventory of Oil Spill Response Resources  Review current systems that provide partial data needed to establish a fully-populated national inventory of oil spill response resources. Provide recommendations on software requirements, data elements, methods to populate inventory and avoid duplication of entries, server requirements and hosting recommendations.  The desired end-result would provide a searchable, real-time data source for oil spill response resources in the United States. 
7.	 Methods for Removal of Oil under Solid Ice  While technology to locate oil under solid ice, or encapsulated within solid ice, is being developed, there is a need for innovative methods to remove that oil once it is located.  White papers are being requested for prototype development and/or testing of new technologies, or adaptations of existing technologies. This may include the use of robotic technology to assist in the cleanup process.
8.	Research to Support the Prediction of Effectiveness of Dispersant Use in the U.S. Beaufort and Chukchi Seas  White papers are being requested on a series of focused studies utilizing the crude oil types and operating conditions typically encountered in the U. S. Beaufort and Chukchi Seas that would provide information to support decision-making and the prediction of dispersant effectiveness.  The oceanographic characteristics such as salinity, temperature, circulation and wave patterns, and the influence of sea ice coverage should all be considered. 
9.	Tools to support the decision-making process of the Federal On Scene Coordinator (FOSC) when determining the optimum response methods given a unique marine oil spill scenario  White papers are being requested on research to develop tools that will assist the FOSC to coordinate response options via decision-making tools.  HOW TO RESPOND: 
White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the DOI/BSEE, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Ms. Herma Banks, not later than 5:00 PM, EASTERN TIME on April 12, 2013.  WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort.  NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER.  The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits.  IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL WILL BE REQUESTED BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FROM YOUR COMPANY.  Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.

<CONTACT>Stephanie P. Fantasia, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-9523, Fax 703-767-2382, Email stephanie.fantasia@dla.mil - Megan R Kesler, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-9553, Email megan.kesler@dla.mil
<DESC><p>The DLA Energy Utility Services Division seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the natural gas distribution (221210), the water distribution system (NAICS 221310), and the wastewater collection system (NAICS 221320) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), OH. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to assume ownership of the utility system(s) at WPAFB and as the new system(s) owner shall operate and maintain the system(s) and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility system(s).</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility. Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead no later than 3:00 pm EST on February 5, 2013. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address: (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating natural gas, water, or wastewater utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business). The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.</p>
<p>This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March 2013 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>If determined appropriate, the Government will issue the synopsis and solicitation in the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") system. To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in FBO, offerors must follow the steps outlined below. It is recommended that all potential offerors complete the steps outlined below in anticipation of a potential synopsis and solicitation to allow ample time for processing in each system.</p>
<p>1. Be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at www.fbo.gov and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. The FBO Vendor Guide is available at<br />https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf to provide assistance.</p>
<p>3. Once your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, click on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form. You can also find the DD2345 at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hardcopy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form. JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date within five days of receipt. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect. Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 form from JCP and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.</p>
<p>a. The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>6. Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>
<p><br />This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DLA Energy Contracting Office.</p>

<p>See Notes:<br />(X) The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 03/28/2013.<br />(X) This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestricted technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C/ 2304 (c) (1). Approved source is: Harris Corporation (91417).<br />(X)While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.<br />(X) The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-9705, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis services collection and data cleaning of occupational history data for a multi-center hospital-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AsiaLymph) from DATA SCIENTISTS PTY LTD, 28 RAILWAY PDE, LOGANLEA, QUEENSLAND 4131, Australia.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance shall be from award through nine (9) months.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>OEEB's mission is to combine epidemiology, quantitative exposure assessment, and molecular components into multi-disciplinary studies to provide insight into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been increasing world-wide in developed and developing countries. Large-scale molecular epidemiological studies in North America, Europe, and Australia (i.e. Western countries) have studied the etiology of NHL using state-of-the-art approaches to exposure assessment.  <br />There are several distinct aspects of NHL patterns in Asia, as compared to the patterns observed in Western countries. To provide insight into the environmental and genetic causes of NHL and related malignancies in Asia, and in particular to explore the etiology of subtypes that are relatively more common in Asia, NCI has conducted a case-control study of NHL in Asia (AsiaLymph).  AsiaLymph is utilizing a computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) to ascertain occupational, family, medical, and residential histories. Specific exposure modules in the CAPI will be triggered in response to certain combinations of industry and job title for certain types of occupational solvents (e.g., benzene, OCs, TCE).</p>
<p>Support is needed to maintain and troubleshoot all aspects of the data being collected by AsiaLymph's customized version of OccIDEAS.  The consistent and proper functioning of OccIDEAS is critical for the collection of the AsiaLymph data.  To successfully maintain OccIDEAS, the contractor must have substantial experience efficiently and productively working within the virtual OccIDEAS platform as well as considerable experience managing and maintaining complex and sophisticated databases and servers. Tasks to be performed include: (A) Review the OccIDEAS database log files on a weekly basis;  (B) Carry out all necessary OccIDEAS server and database maintenance on a weekly basis;  (C) Attend monthly teleconference meetings with the NCI; and,  (D) Investigate issues and perform tests on the OccIDEAS server on a weekly basis to identify and troubleshoot problems.</p>
<p>Data Scientists Pty Ltd has specific knowledge of OccIDEAS as well as the AsiaLymph databases and servers that will be needed to be manipulated to carry out the data collection and cleaning. Data Scientists Pty Ltd has a proven experience in bioinformatics statistics, and software development, and has previously demonstrated these abilities. They have worked with NCI databases, and are familiar with NCI's data organization tool. Using the same contractor, Data Scientists Pty, for the current project will provide consistency in results. The NCI knows of no other entity that possesses the necessary expertise. Therefore, given Data Scientists Pty Ltd.'s unique knowledge, experience and capability to carry out the terms of this contract, they are the only contractor able to provide this service.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.   Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM EST, on March 26, 2013.  For further information, please contact Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through sam.gov.   Reference: NCI-130047-TG on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Officer in Charge requires all labor, management, supervision, tools, materials, transportation, and equipment and other items necessary to provide Custodial services at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY), Kittery, Maine.  The work includes, but is not limited to, Floor care (various); trash removal; Interior/Exterior Window Cleaning; Employee Mess Area Cleaning; and Restroom cleaning.
The work identified is to be provided by means of a combination Firm-Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity contract.  Source Selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that provides the lowest price and is technically acceptable to the government.  Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Method.
  In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology:  Proposal will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest price to highest price).  The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the five (5) lowest priced proposals.  The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal from among the five (5) lowest priced proposals.  However, the Navy, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to increase the number of proposals it will review under this methodology.  Accordingly under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contract concerning the proposals received.
  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both technical and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.

The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Asea Brown Bovari (ABB) Inc., for Maintenance Services for NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic seam plants Distributed Control System (Bailey Net90/Infi90).  Sole source procedures will be utilized due to the required specialized maintenance and proprietary software and equipment.  This requirement provides continuous maintenance on the same type of systems at a total of eleven different locations.  The resulting contract will have one base year and four option periods under the NAICS code of 334513.  This maintenance requirement includes (1) Onsite Maintenance, (2) Preventive Maintenance, (3) Corrective Maintenance, (4) Rapid Response Retainer Service, (5) Extended Parts Warranty, and (6) Continuous Assurance Program.
  This requirement will also include training on new software programs as they are released.  This office will no longer issue a hard copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ); therefore, a copy can be obtained from website http://www.neco.navy.mil.  By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this RFQ, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.
  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.bpn.gov.  The Government intends to include and evaluate prices for clause FAR 52.217-8, prior to making award.  The RFQ should be posted on or before 25 April 2013.

<CONTACT>James R. Davis, Contract Specialist, Phone 850-883-3431, Email james.davis@eglin.af.mil - Kevin R. Miller, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-883-3404, Email kevin.miller@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis: The following is a Request for Information (RFI) to gather data for planning purposes. This sources sought synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does it in any way restrict the Government to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government is not liable for any costs incurred by the Contractor in response to this synopsis and therefore will not compensate any Contractor for work performed in response to this synopsis. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Test and Training Division, Range Systems Branch, is conducting market research to determine potential sources for an additional FY14 follow-on production to the P5 Combat Training System/Tactical Combat Training System (P5CTS/TCTS) acquisition, hereafter referred to as the P5CTS. The P5CTS provides realistic air combat training to the warfighter and employs instrumentation on high activity participant aircraft and Ground Subsystem components. The system contains an air-to-air data link for sharing participant Global Positioning System based time-space-position information, and is capable of both rangeless and ground-based live monitor operations.</p>
<p>The P5CTS includes the Airborne Subsystems (pods) (AN/ASQ-T50(V)1 and AN/ASQ-T50(V)2, with Data Recording Devices (DRDs)), Ground Subsystems (Transportable with and without live monitor (AN/GSQ-T104 and AN/GSQ-T105), Portable (AN/PSQ-T3) and Fixed (AN/GSZ-T106)), and Remote Range Units (AN/FSQ-T33); auxiliary equipment (including hanger band weights, boot flash modules, umbilicals, A-10 adapters) and support equipment. Peculiar support equipment includes a Control Display Unit. The P5CTS interfaces with user field site infrastructure, electronic warfare servers, and Radiant Mercury ground guards located at live monitor locations.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis and RFI includes a requirement for continued production of the P5CTS (dual band - L and S Band). The Government plans to award a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract for continued production of the baseline system. The Government expects the Contractor to provide a one-year warranty on all deliverables effective upon system acceptance. The Government expects to include in the contract a requirement for the following: (1) delivery of Airborne Subsystems (approximately 96 pods), associated Ground Subsystems, auxiliary and support equipment for PACAF locations, and spares; (2) systems/sustaining engineering and technical support; and, (3) travel.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform site surveys, site installations, system check-out, and Site Acceptance Testing for all production deliverables. The Contractor shall provide training to pilots, flight line, and maintenance crews (instructional and hands on) to ensure Government personnel are thoroughly prepared to operate and maintain the delivered system.</p>
<p>Field crews accomplish limited maintenance at organizational level (remove and replace line replaceable units). Contract services apply for depot level support. The Government does not have unlimited data rights for the system (limited rights apply to the pod hardware, and restricted rights apply to the pod software). The Government does not have a complete technical data package or depot level manuals. While the Government has some drawings for the Airborne Subsystem, it does not have any drawings for the Ground Subsystem. The Ground Subsystem consists primarily of commercial off-the-shelf components, with the exception of the Remote Range Unit and DRD readers; however, the Ground Subsystem requires peculiar software and firmware. The P5CTS uses the proprietary Individual Combat Aircrew Display System. Also, the Government took delivery of executable software or firmware code only and has no source code for the system.</p>
<p>For the above efforts, interested parties would be required to establish subcontracts, nondisclosure arrangements, and interfaces with other Contractors and Government agencies to: (1) perform tasks necessary to ensure the P5CTS, its interfaces, and subcomponent integration meet the system performance requirements in accordance with the specifications; (2) enable free exchange of information, both proprietary and nonproprietary; and (3) resolve problems to prevent schedule delays.</p>
<p>The AFLCMC Range Systems Branch is interested in the following for PACAF operations:</p>
<p>(1) Production of the baseline system (dual band - L and S Band) (approximately 96 Airborne Subsystems), associated Ground Subsystems, auxiliary equipment and support equipment) (13 to 15 months from contract award);<br />(2) Production of spares; and<br />(3) One-year system warranty on all delivered items.</p>
<p>Information available for potential Government solicitation includes:</p>
<p>(1) Some nonproprietary P5CTS drawings and documentation, such as, P5CTS performance specification and technical orders; and<br />(2) P5CTS executable code only.</p>
<p>Contractors shall ensure Statements of Capabilities provide specific relevant experience and/or approach, as appropriate, in satisfying the above requirements, to include:</p>
<p>(1) Demonstrated production of P5CTS Airborne Subsystems (pods), integrated with Ground Subsystems and infrastructure, and successful site acceptance testing;<br />(2) Capacity to produce baseline Airborne and Ground Subsystems, auxiliary and support equipment for delivery within 13 to 15 months after contract award;<br />(3) Experience/Knowledge in:<br />a. Air Combat Training Systems and Air Force training ranges, specifically installations and operations in PACAF (Kadena AB and Misawa AB in Japan; Osan AB and Kunsan AB in Korea);<br />b. Site installations and testing, to include integration with range infrastructure (e.g., electronic warfare servers, Radiant Mercury, etc.);<br />c. System integration;<br />d. Aircraft interfaces and certification of aircraft stores</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to submit their Statement of Capabilities in the form of a White Paper, a maximum of 10 single-sided pages with text no less than 12-point font (Arial or Times New Roman) and a minimum of one-inch margins in Microsoft&reg; Word, Adobe&reg; PDF or compatible format. Do not include photos or references as part of the package. Number and title each paragraph in your response to align with paragraphs (1) and (2) and (3) a.-d. above. If no experience/capability, indicate same in your response.</p>
<p>Format white papers as follows:</p>
<p>Section A: Title; Name of Company; Name; Telephone number; Email address for a Point of Contact; Contractor Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code; Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number in the capability package and indicate company category (e.g., a US company, large business, small business, small disadvantaged business or women-owned small business) as described by NAICS code 334220. Those desiring to do business with the Air Force must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration System (http://www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>Section B: Background: Brief History highlighting past relevant experience designing, developing, testing, integrating, and producing Air Combat Training Systems, to include installations at PACAF locations. Interested parties shall respond based on all paragraphs above and identify number of years and specific systems.<br /><br />Section C: Experience/Capabilities: Identify how existing capabilities will be used to satisfy paragraphs above.</p>
<p>Section D: Workarounds Where Capabilities Do Not Exist: For each paragraph above where capabilities do not exist, identify how the requirements would be satisfied. <br />Specifically address workarounds required due to the lack of hardware/software technical data package and the lack of software/firmware source code.</p>
<p>Information associated with this effort is unclassified or classified up to, and including, SECRET. If respondents wish to restrict distribution of White Papers, they must be marked appropriately. The Contractors should mark all unclassified and classified responses accordingly and review to ensure consideration of operational sensitivities prior to submission. The Government will post responses to questions that are broadly applicable to all on the FedBizOpps website. The Government encourages Unclassified responses to the maximum extent practicable. The Contractors must coordinate Classified responses with AFLCMC/EBYK, Kevin Miller, 314 W. Choctawhatchee Ave, Bldg 40, Eglin AFB, Florida, 32542-5700.</p>
<p>Participation is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government. The Government must receive responses by 4:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on Tuesday, 26 March 2013. At the sole discretion of the Procuring Contracting Officer, any responses received after this date and time may not be considered. The Contractor may submit Capability Statements and/or questions in writing electronically to Kevin Miller, kevin.miller@eglin.af.mil or regular mail to AFLCMC/EBYK Attn: Kevin Miller, 314 W. Choctawhatchee Ave, Bldg 40, Eglin AFB, Florida, 32542-5700; or faxed to (850) 882-3226.</p>

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command - New Jersey in support of the Armament, Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) intends to solicit, negotiate, and enter into a section 845 Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with the Consortium for Command, Control, Communications and Computer Technologies (C5).  Section 845 of Public Law 103-160, as amended, authorizes the use of OTAs, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, under certain circumstances for prototype initiatives directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems proposed to be acquired or developed by the DoD.   <br>  <br> The government has a need to team with industry, academic, and nonprofit partners through establishment of an Other Transaction agreement with C5 members. Through the proposed agreement, the Government's primary objective is to collaborate with a consortium to perform a coordinated research and development program designed to develop prototype technologies improving U.S. industry, university, and Government capabilities as required to sustain U.S. military supremacy in weapon system information technologies.  <br>  <br> A consortium comprised of educational, nonprofit, and commercial organizations and with broad and open membership is required to provide the Government a partner able to collaborate across barriers that include military/civilian, public/private, local/regional/national, and political/jurisdictional concerns. The consortium should be open to new membership and display a broad array of expertise and experience, connected to weapon system information related technologies and applications.   <br>  <br> OTA's for prototype initiatives are acquisition instruments that generally are not subject to the federal laws and regulations governing procurement (FAR based) contracts.   As such, they are not required to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), its supplements (i.e., DFARS) or laws that are limited in applicability to procurement contracts.  To be eligible for an OTA instrument, the proposing contractor must be a non-traditional contractor or have at least one nontraditional defense contractor participating to a significant extent OR provide a one third cost sharing.  In addition, the contractor must have the capability to manage both classified and non-classified prototype initiatives.   Two OTAs to the same consortium may be awarded, one to handle classified work and one to handle unclassified work. <br>  <br> Under the proposed agreement, members of the C5 shall carry out a coordinated research and development program designed to develop prototype hardware, software, and system technologies directly relevant to the development of weapons and weapon systems proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense (DoD). <br> Consortium objectives will be to develop, demonstrate, implement, and transition technologies that improve weapon system security, concepts and designs that address threats, vulnerabilities, and security disciplines of systems, networks and applications.  Related areas of interest include development of weapon systems using applied system security engineering processes that enforce risk mitigation as well as implement cost-effective countermeasures not limited to information assurance controls, software protection products, effective rigorous software development processes as well as enforcing software design rigor and physical security measures. <br>  <br> In addition, the consortium will seek to improve control unit system concepts and designs that address expanded performance ranges, advanced technologies to increase targeting precision and situational awareness.  Areas of interest include development of control unit systems with enhanced survivability, penetration depth, range and explosive performance for both nonlethal and lethal concepts, military research operations, emergency response, testing, and training. <br>  <br> The consortium will address Army logistics systems support and development, battlefield automation systems, data architecture and design, enterprise solutions and product lifecycle management.   This support will include development of enterprise software systems that support battlefield systems, client/server architecture and open system portability and scalability.  In addition, the consortium will provide system engineering and integration services for software and hardware weapon programs as well as research and development programs, modeling and simulation, and using data to develop/improve/refine products and analysis tools. <br>  <br> The consortium will leverage emerging software system concepts and designs that address the broad and diverse capabilities in advanced weapon technology, research, test, prototyping and advanced engineering development of weapon systems.  Areas of interest include development of software systems that support battlefield automation systems, data architecture and design, high performance technologies, rapid prototyping , sensors, unmanned air systems (UASs), and unmanned ground systems for battlefield applications. <br>  <br> The consortium will also seek to improve engineering design, technical support data and software support that address supportability design and analysis, engineering process improvement, field support, obsolescence, rapid prototyping, systems engineering, and technology insertion as applied to the development of weapon system technologies. A formal written solicitation is not planned.   <br>  <br> Any responsible/interested sources shall electronically submit their qualifications and capabilities within fifteen (15) business days of this notice to: Ms. Kristen Kachur at Kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil.   Information submitted should include your organization, personnel, facilities, applicable subcontractor network and past experience to meet specific needs stated above.  Include company name, address, telephone number, technical point of contact, item nomenclature, item description, and brochure/literature. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION.  Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement.  <br>  <br> Electronic submittals are required.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH.  <br>  <br> This is a sources sought announcement only for the purposes of conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not serve to bind the U.S. Government in any way. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov for the release of any follow-on information. The Government will not reimburse any concern for any information that is submitted in response to this sources sought request. Any information submitted is voluntary. <br>  <br> The MICC Fort Stewart Contracting Office intends to issue a six-month extension to the incumbent contractor for Dining Facility Attendant Services on Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia. The extension period will be from 1 April 2013 to 30 September 2013. This announcement is to determine the extent to which small businesses are capable of performing as the prime contractor for all labor, personnel (with all required certifications), equipment, materials, supplies, supervision and other items and services necessary to provide Dining Facility Attendant (DFA) service across twelve (12) dining facilities located on Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield; with approximately 67 meal periods per month (breakfast, lunch, dinner during the week and brunch, dinner during weekends) with a rough average headcount of 250 per meal. These dining facilities are not normally all operated simultaneously but are opened and closed based on the needs of the installations. The work to be performed would require the contractor to be on site and fully operational on 1 April 2013.  The six month extension will allow for sufficient time to compete the follow-on requirement which will be posted on the FBO website.  Four months will be issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8 which is included in the contract, and two additional months will be used as a bridge if it becomes necessary. <br>  <br> This work is performed under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 722310. The small business size standard for this NAICS is $35.5 million average annual revenue for the last three fiscal years. Work under this requirement shall provide the management, administration, supplies, materials and labor necessary to perform the required services.  <br>  <br> Any response to this sources sought must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Government's needs. Responses must be received no later than 9:00 a.m. EST, Wednesday, March 20, 2013 by email to brandon.m.chapman.mil@mail.mil and james.r.frye20.civ@mail.mil. No solicitation will be released for competition from this announcement, and no reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this announcement. No contract will be awarded on a basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government. No solicitation document is available and telephones requests for technical information will not be honored.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, Quotation abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND<br /><br /></span></strong>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognize that it is critical to establish relationships with organizations that encourage and foster communication and information access. A major effort to enhance understanding of information needs, resources, and services began in June 1993 when NLM and the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) cosponsored a conference that brought together users of NIH information resources including health care providers, scientists, information specialists, journalists, and members of the community affected by HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the conference was to review the various HIV/AIDS information services, assess current efforts with respect to needs, and identify additional needs. The resultant recommendations were widely circulated and continue to be utilized for planning and informational purposes. The conference report is available on the NLM AIDS Web Site http://www.sis.nlm.nih.gov/hiv/nihrpt.pdf.<br /><br />Patients and the affected community want access to the most up-to-date and accurate health information to manage their care and make informed decisions about their health. Health care providers and health educators also need access to the most current information to provide the highest quality of care. Information access disparities exist in many communities that are affected by the digital divide. NLM is committed to assisting community-based organizations in accessing the spectrum of information resources and services that are currently available. <br /><br />As a result of the recommendations made during the conference, the National Library of Medicine issued a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for AIDS Community Information Outreach projects in May of 1994. Between 1995 and 2012, similar solicitations were issued (see http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/outreach/aids_cio_projects.html for a list of past award recipients). The goal of the AIDS Community Information Outreach funding is to improve access to HIV/AIDS related health information by patients, the affected community, and their caregivers. NLM has continued to issue this solicitation into the year 2013 and has awarded over 300 organizations with funding in an effort to eliminate disparity of information access in the HIV/AIDS Community. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OBJECTIVES<br /><br /></span></strong>The purpose of the AIDS Community Information Outreach Project is to design local programs for improving HIV/AIDS health information access for patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers and the general public. Emphasis is on providing information or access to health and medical information in a way meaningful to the target community, and increasing the awareness and utilization of NLM online health and medical resources in the HIV/AIDS Community. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br /><br /></span></strong>Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories:<br /><br />1. Information Retrieval: To provide or improve access to electronic AIDS- and other health-related information resources by the organization or by the clients they serve and to implement access to state-of-the-art AIDS-related information tools via the Internet and/or mobile phone technologies. This may require the purchase of hardware (computer equipment), software, or contractual relationships necessary to obtain a connection to the Internet for the purpose of accessing AIDS-related information or sharing AIDS-related information.
<p>2. Skills Development: Training to develop skills in accessing or using HIV/AIDS-related information including the use of NLM online databases and mobile resources as well as general AIDS information resources in order to improve services and benefit the community. This may include training for the staff of the agency, development of training programs for clients and patrons, training programs for other agencies, etc.;</p>
<p>3. Resource Development: To support an organization to meet the needs of their clients or communities by developing specific educational or informational materials such as culturally or language specific fact sheets, bibliographies, guides or other products.</p>
<p>4. Equipment Acquisition: To improve access to electronic AIDS and other health-related information resources may require the purchase of hardware (computer equipment), software, or contractual relationships necessary to obtain a connection to the Internet for the purpose of accessing AIDS-related information or sharing AIDS-related information.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br /><br /></strong></span>It is anticipated that the period of performance shall be between twelve (12) from the date of award. Awards are anticipated to be made in September of 2013.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS<br /><br /></strong></span>The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.<br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:</p>
<p>(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for Small Business Search (Please see attached document for details).
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Ohio Water Science Center has a requirement for services to be provided for field sample collection at four sites in the western Lake Erie area:  Maumee Bay State Park Lake Erie Beach, Maumee Bay State Park inland beach, Lions Park (Sandusky), and one additional site on Sandusky Bay or Lake Erie.  
In Ohio, local health officials have identified the presence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) during the summer and early fall seasons at some Lake Erie and inland lake beaches. The HABs are caused by cyanobacteria that produce microcystin and other toxins. The overall goal of the project is to apply new tools over an entire season to better understand the link between cyanobacteria community structure, environmental and water-quality factors, and HAB toxicity.  The new tools include (1) assays for a molecular method, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR),  that target the genes for cyanobacteria and toxin producers and (2) optical sensors based on the fluorescent properties of chlorophyll (indicative of total phytoplankton abundance) and phycocyanin (indicative of cyanobacterial abundance). 
The USGS is seeking small business sources to provide the following services:
Scope of Work:
This scope of work is for the collection of field data and samples from May through December, 2013, by the contractor and includes the following elements:
1. Eight sampling trips throughout the season on days agreed upon between the contractor and the USGS project chief. Some sampling trips will be scheduled to target HABs.  A tentative schedule is one sampling trip in May, one in July, two in August, two in September, one in October, and one in November.
2. Samples will be collected at the following sites during each trip:
- Maumee Bay State Park Lake Erie beach
- Maumee Bay State Park inland beach (control site not generally affected by HABs)
- Two additional sites on Sandusky Bay or western Lake Erie.  Potential sites include Lions Park (Sandusky), Bay View West (Sandusky), East Harbor State Park, and Port Clinton.
3. During each sampling trip the following constituents will be measured:
- Specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, chlorophyll, and phycocyanin at the time of sampling using an in-situ probe.   The USGS will provide equipment for all these measurements.   The contractor is expected to maintain and calibrate equipment per manufacturers instructions, and record calibrations in a log book.
 - In addition to measurements during the 8 sampling trips, these measurements will also be made regularly (weekly or more often) throughout the season.
- Secchi depth at the time of sampling.  The USGS will provide equipment, if needed.
- The contractor will completely and accurately fill out field observations on field forms (provided by the USGS) at each site during each sampling trip. 
- At each beach, a sample is collected from six locations (three transects at knee- and hip-deep water) within the designated swimming area and composited into one sample.   If an accumulation of cyanobacteria occurs outside of the transect location, an additional sample will be collected from the accumulation.
- The composited sample will be split into aliquots for different analyses.  All bottles, preservation supplies, filtering equipment and supplies, and shipping materials will be provided by the USGS.  Analytical service request forms (ASRs) will be filled out for each sample type (provided by the USGS), keeping a copy for the file and shipping the original paperwork with the sample.   
 - Nutrients.  Samples filtered and preserved on ice and shipped to the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory, in Denver, Colo. on ice within 48 hrs of sampling.
- Cyanotoxins (microcystin, saxitoxin, and cylindrospermopsins by ELISA (total).  Two 100-mL samples are frozen (total toxins) within 24-hours of collection.  One sample from each pair is shipped on dry ice to the USGS Kansas Organic Geochemistry Laboratory.  Samples are shipped twice during the sampling period.
-Phytoplankton abundance and community structure by microscopy.  Samples are preserved with lugols solution and stored in the refrigerator.  They are shipped in a box to BSA Environmental in Cleveland, Ohio, twice during the sampling period. 
- Cyanotoxins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  This will be done for approximately 25 percent of samples if a more detailed analysis is warranted (i.e., the phytoplankton community structure consists of anatoxin producers).  Samples are processed and preserved as described above for ELISA.
- Cyanobacteria by qPCR.   Three sample aliquots of approximately 30-mL are filtered in the field or within 15 min of sampling, stored on dry ice during transport, kept frozen in the laboratory, and transported on dry ice by personnel from the USGS to the USGS Ohio Water Microbiology in Columbus, Ohio. Samples will be transported to Columbus twice during the sampling period.
Training in field data collection methods and sample processing will be provided by the USGS Ohio Water Science Center.  Regular QA/QC performance checks will be conducted by USGS Ohio Water Science Center staff on contractor's personnel throughout the specified project timeframe.
The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to provide the above mentioned service.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required service or its functional equivalent (based on criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required supply/service stated herein.  This information will be used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request.

All offered properties must be located within 1.5 miles from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center located at 1600 SW Archer Rd, Gainesville, FL, 32608. If an offered property is located more than 1.5 miles form the above-mentioned Clinic; then the base price per parking space, must include a shuttle service at no extra cost for the Government.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

"	Availability date.
"	Documents to prove property is outside the 100 Yr flood plain
"	Building ownership information
"	List of services provided (lighting, maintenance).

The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

The Government is limited by law (40 USC 278a, as Amended 10-1-81) to pay no more than the appraised fair rental value for space.

The lease term requirement is for a term of Three (3) Years / One (1) Year Firm Term. The space must be available for occupancy by October 1, 2013. Space within or fronting on the following boundaries will be considered:

					NORTH: University Ave
					SOUTH: Williston Rd
					EAST: S. Main St
					WEST: SW 34th St

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or to remain at its current location. 

All offered properties must be located within 1.5 miles from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center located at 1600 SW Archer Rd, Gainesville, FL, 32608. If an offered property is located more than 1.5 miles form the above-mentioned Clinic; then the base price per parking space, must include a shuttle service at no extra cost for the Government.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

Please send expressions of interest to Todd Pappas by mail or e-mail no later than 2:00 PM Mar 22, 2013 at the following:
300 E. University Ave

"	Rentable parking spaces available and expected rental rate per parking space, fully serviced
"	Availability date.
"	Document to prove the property is outside the 100 Yr flood plain
"	Building ownership information
"	List of services provided (lighting, maintenance, shuttle).

The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, the USDA Agricultural Research Service intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with AKIMA Facilities Management, LLC a Three (3) month extension period and three one month extension options periods for a Firm Fixed Price modification for extension of services, with a small IDIQ component. The acquisition is to provide uninterrupted contractor support services to meet the operational mission of ERRC. Services shall be for facilities operations, maintenance and administrative support services at the Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC) in Wyndmoor Pennsylvania. The Contractor is required to provide services to maintain the facility in full support of the research mission. This bridge modification will allow enough time for the long term follow-on effort for the Operations and Maintenance Services requirement to be competed. By not awarding a modification to extend the period of performance for&nbsp;the bridge modification&nbsp;it would adversely impact the mission of the ERRC (In accordance with FAR 6.302(a)(2)).
<p>The contractor is required to provide services that include but are not limited to: Work Management, Administrative Services, Facilities Services and Utility Services for a period starting April 1, 2013. The Contractor is also required to interface with other Contractors onsite.</p>
<p>ERRC is one of four Regional Research Centers whose scientists and engineers conduct mission oriented research directed toward the development of new methods and processes for: Detection and and characterization of Human Pathogens, Microbial Predictive Modeling, Sustainable agricultural practices and production of Bio-Fuels, Development of bio-based products, Effective Intervention and Innovative Technologies, Opening and Expanding domestic and foreign markets, Utilization of By-Products, Development of new Dairy products with improved functionality and Health Benefits. To that end, it is vital to the research mission of the WRRC that the incumbent continue to provide O&amp;M support.</p>
<p>This six (6) month bridge modification extension (after exercising base and all option periods) is necessary to allow for sufficient time to complete the re-competition procedures for a new follow on contract. No other offeror could immediately perform all of the required services within the necessary time frame and period of performance of six (6) months is a sufficient timeframe in which to transition a new contractor. Therefore, AKIMA is uniquely qualified as the incumbent contractor to provide continuity of services to ARS. This notice is not a request for competitive bids, rather public notice as required to allow for a competitive follow-on Contract for the aforementioned service.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ) Picatinny Arsenal, has a requirement from the PD TMDE to provide the Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS). <br>  <br> NGATS is the latest addition to the Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) developed and managed by the PD TMDE.  NGATS is a reconfigurable, general-purpose, mobile, deployable, Automatic Test System (ATS) designed to provide off-platform sustainment support to all Army weapon systems.  This flexible testing platform will provide diagnostic maintenance of Current and Future Force electronic systems and will standardize the Army's Automatic Test Equipment (ATE).  NGATS tests Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) by isolating failures to the component level.  Current ATS in the Army inventory, such as the IFTE Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF) V3/V5 and the Direct Support Electrical System Test Set (DSESTS), are experiencing sustainment and obsolescence issues.  NGATS is the answer to filling these needs. <br>  <br> In accordance with Statement of Work (SOW), the contractor will produce and support the NGATS Console, perform final integration and verification of the NGATS console into the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) shelter, and provide engineering services.  Expected products from this effort will be complete production quality NGATS consoles, integration of a subset of the consoles into government provided shelters in accordance with the CLIN structure, a complete technical data package suitable for re-competition efforts, documentation required to maintain the system, logistics support plans and data, a complete set of technical manuals, and all software source code. <br>

<a href="mailto:angelic.m.hatcher.civ@mail.mil">MICC Center - Fort Sam Houston (JBSA)</a>
<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT. The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Sam Houston Contracting Office on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (OACSIM) intends to negotiate and award a logical follow-on in the interest of economy and efficiency to an original order placed against the Information Technology Enterprise Solutions - 2 (ITES-2) contract under CHESS. This order will be issued to Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102-4904 to procure services in support of the Headquarters Installation Information System (HQIIS). The objective end state and vision for HQIIS is a single well-engineered, web-enabled enterprise integrated management database system which provides accurate, reliable and timely information through sustainable business processes where data is captured once at the auditable source and available for use by the entire user community and to maintain the Army's registry of installation, site, enclave, and base information needed for the Army's real property and related business processes, within the terms and conditions of the contract, for the development, unit testing and integration testing portions of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to include: (1) HQIIS Data Repository and User Interface/Data Entry Capabilities, (2) HQIIS Reporting Capabilities/Data Analysis, (3) HQIIS User Support, (4) HQIIS Documentation, (5) HQIIS Support to Department of Defense (DoD) Real Property Analysis Database (RPAD), (6) System Interfaces and Web Services, (7) Business Modernization Support, (8) McKinney Act Support, (9) Operations and Maintenance Support, and (10) Project Management Support. This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price Task Order with a period of performance of approximately 6 months beginning 1 April 2013. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541512 with a size standard of $25.5M. <br> Booz Allen Hamilton has the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain services currently performed under task order W91QUZ-06-D-0019-1V06. No source other than the incumbent can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. For the reasons noted above, MICC - FSH intends to award a short-term logical follow-on task order to Booz Allen Hamilton to ensure that the OACSIM is able to meet its mission without any lapse in services while the competitive process for the follow-on acquisition is completed. <br> No contract will be awarded on the basis of reponses received to this notice. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the OACSIM's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. All questions and/or responses must be directed to Angelic Hatcher via email at angelic.m.hatcher.civ@mail.mil. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Please note a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition will be posted within 14 days of award.

<DESC><p>As you are likely aware, effective March 1, 2013, the Budget Control Act mandated budget reductions totaling $85 billion across the Federal government for the remainder of the Federal fiscal year.</p>
<p>As contractors with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), we are writing to provide you with timely and clear information about how these budget cuts impact us, and in turn what it means for funds provided to you.</p>
<p>At this time, USDA is taking steps to mitigate the effects of these cuts, but based on our initial analysis, it is likely that your company's workforce, revenue, and planning processes may be affected. For example, USDA may decide not to exercise an option on your contract or may need to negotiate lower prices or other terms via a bilateral modification to meet the constraints imposed by sequestration. The Department may also determine it necessary to stop or suspend work, reduce the scope of work, or partially or completely terminate your contract for convenience. Additionally, planned contract actions for new work may be rescoped, delayed, or canceled depending on the nature of the work and the degree to which it directly supports the agency's missions.</p>
<p>To the extent that your contract is affected due to these budget cuts, you will be contacted by the appropriate Contracting Officer with additional details. Thank you for your continued work and cooperation as we manage these circumstances.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lisa M. Wilusz<br />Director, Office of Procurement and Property Management<br />and Senior Procurement Executive</p>

<DESC>This project requires climbing whitebark pine trees, caging the cones, then returning to pick cones with ripe seeds from those trees in compliance with the terms, specifications, and provisions incorporated herein. Whitebark pine trees are scattered over a few locations within the Colville National Forest generally above 6,000 feet in elevation.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies and incidentals to do the job.
<p>The collection of whitebark pine cones requires two visits per tree (stem) per year.  In early to mid July, depending on environmental conditions, the tree is climbed and wire mesh cone cages are placed and secured over branches with developing cones to protect the cones from predation from birds and rodents.  The cages remain on the trees (stems) through September, then the trees (stems) are climbed again, the cages are removed, and the cones and seeds are collected.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only Request for Quote (RFQ). Written quotes are being requested. A hardcopy written RFQ will not be issued.
<p>NOAA's Santa Crus Tiburon Laboratory in cooperation with designated researchers at University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), successful vendor will conduct quarterly shipboard measurements along Monterey Bay Transect Lines 60 and 67 through September 2013. NOAA, Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) or Moss Landing Marine Lab (MLML) ships will continue to serve as the sampling platform for all cruises. Measurements for the Summer and Fall cruises will consist of Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD)/rosette casts, plankton tows, vessel-mounted acoustic doppler current profilers (VMADCP) current observations, and continuous underway measurements of sea surface and meteorological parameters. CTD stations are placed at 10 National Meter Identifier (nmi) intervals from the head of Monterey Submarine Canyon to station 67-90 and at 20 nmi intervals for the remainder of the survey. Casts will extend to 1000 m along line 67 where water depth permits.</p>
<p>Niskin bottle samples from the CTD casts will be obtained from the surface to 200 m at even stations and to 1000 m at odd stations. This seawater will be assayed for nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phophase and silicate). Water samples in the upper 200 m will also be assayed for Chlorophyll-a, primary production, phytoplankton taxonomy and cell counts. Two water samples from each cast will be used for laboratory salinometer measurements of salinity. Water samples will also be collected for subsequent laboratory analyses of dissolved oxygen content. From historical data and these observations, algorithms well be developed and refined to convert surface chlorophyll and fluorescence profiles to primary and new production. A Seabird 911 plus CTD will be used for the measurements. The CTD will include primary and secondary temperature and conductivity measurements, fluorometer, transmissometer, Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and dissolved oxygen measurements. Conductivity and temperature sensors are calibrated regularly and laboratory salinometer measurements maintain the accuracy of salinity at 0.003. Data are processed using Seabird software and binned into one or two decibar intervals. Derived quantities (density anomaly, spiciness, geopotential) are computed using the 1980 Equation of State.</p>
<p>Underway measurements of sea surface and atmospheric conditions including pCO2 will be made. Atmospheric parameters include wind speed and direction, air temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and PAR. Sea surface observations include temperature, salinity, and fluorometry. VMADCP measurements are made with a 150 kilohertz Teledyne RD Instruments Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Data are collected at 1 second (s) intervals in 8 meter (m) bins extending from 15 m to 300 - 400 m depth, depending upon weather conditions. 1 s pings are averaged over 5 minutes and data processed using software developed at the University of Hawaii. An attitude measuring system insures that the accuracy of the ship's heading is about 0.1 degree.</p>
<p>Successful vendor will be responsible for 1) coordinating the collection and processing all aspects of the physical oceanographic sampling described above for the summer and fall cruises including at-sea data collection, 2) leading the preparation of a technical report for the summer and fall cruises, and 3) archival of CTD data from the summer and fall cruises at National Oceanographic Data Center and Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory /Environmental Research Division, 4) preparing syntheses of the measurements for the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations annual reports, professional meetings, and publication.</p>
<p>Minimum Qualification Factors<br />- Contractor must have demonstrated experience with longitudinal studies of the California Current.<br />- Contractor must have experience with conducting shipboard oceanographic studies.<br />-Contractor must have professional experience with oceanographic chemical analysis and have access to facilities to carry out such analysis.<br /><br />Interested firms shall provide, in writing, a brief narrative (no more than 4 pages in length) and documentation to support your firm's capability and experience meeting the requirements herein.<br /><br />The period of performance is anticipated to be from May 2013 to Dec 2013, with no option period thereafter.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990 with a size standard of $14M.</p>
<p>The government intends to issue a firm fixed price contract with period of performance commencing approximately May1, 2013 through Dec 31, 2013 with no option period. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within ten (10) calendar days of its publication.

Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may override negative trends. <br> 	The Government may collect information from references provided by the offeror in regard to its past performance (See below elements that should be addressed).    References other than those identified by the offeror and the information received will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance. <br> 	The offeror must provide the information requested for performance risk evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no directly related or similar past performance.

Any response in rebuttal to a survey must include factual support for the contractor's assessment of the situation. <br> VOLUME 2 - Price <br> 	The offeror shall provide separate price information containing prices for each and every line item as designated in the solicitation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />1.0 GENERAL: Syllabic Rate Squelch Prototype and Production</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE: <br />This effort provides for the initial procurement of one (1) Pre-production Syllabic Rate Squelch (SRS) unit (part# SRSS-V3), one (1) Spare Parts Kit (part# SCPK-V3), and associated technical documentation. The SRS units will be utilized for installations at the two USCG Communications Area Master Stations (CAMS) and Communication Station (COMMSTA) Kodiak. In addition to the initial procurement, the anticipated total procurement is expected to include as many as twenty (20) Syllabic Rate Squelch units and twenty (20) Spare Parts Kits over the life of the contract. The Spare Parts Kit will include two (2) Squelch Modules (part# SCSM-V3) plus one (1) Power Module (part# SCPM-V3).<br />Each SRS unit shall be capable of providing noise reduction to at least eight (8) communications circuits, with each RF subassembly (Squelch Module) dedicated to a single circuit. Each RF subassembly shall be interchangeable to all others within the SRS unit.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND: <br />Due to high noise levels encountered by Coast Guard watch standers while monitoring High Frequency (HF) communications circuits, a requirement for a noise filtering device was established. The Coast Guard worked with a vendor that was experienced in building communications filtering/squelch devices. The vendor developed a prototype SRS unit that would remove excessive noise from HF communications circuits using a squelch device designed to respond to certain speech characteristics. Following rigid testing and evaluating of the capabilities of the prototype, two of these units were installed as a pilot installation at COMMSTA Kodiak. Based on the results of this pilot installation, a determination has been made to move forward with production installations at COMMSTA Kodiak and the two CAMS facilities.</p>

<p><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>(1) Agency, Contracting Activity</p>
<p>The United States Coast Guard Command, Control, &amp; Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), Portsmouth, VA.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br />This piece of equipment is needed for noise reduction in high frequency (HF) radio watchstander booths where multiple HF receivers are being monitored simultaneously. The ability to apply noise reduction via squelch circuitry on each individual HF channel is required, as is the ability for the watchstander to monitor audio activity within the device, electrical power present, and status that the device is working for each individual channel.</p>
<p>(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including total estimated value):</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is an IDIQ Contract with one base year and three option years to procure up to:</p>
<p>Initial Purchase of : 1 each of: SRSS-V3 Squelch Device (Up to 20 Each over the 4 year period)<br />Initial Purchase of: 1each of: Spare Parts Kit SCPK-V3 Squelch Device (Up to 20 Each over the 4 year period)</p>
<p>Initial Purchase of: 1 each of: Technical Manual in electronic format</p>
<p>Estimated value of all items (4 Yrs) : 130,000.00<br /><br />(4) Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />Section (ii) "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-(AA) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition..." is directly applicable.<br />(5) Contractor's Unique Qualifications</p>
<p>Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: The US Coast Guard tasked C3CEN with developing a method for one watch-stander to affectively monitor multiple HF receivers. While researching capabilities, SHIPCOM was determined to be the only vendor that manufactured a Syllabic Rate Squelch System (SRSS). In addition, SHIPCOM's SRSS was the most acceptable means to satisfy the operational requirement and the only SRSS-like system in use by commercial communication services. Substantial additional development costs and delays would be incurred if another vendor was awarded the contract.</p>
<p>SRSS is proprietary equipment SHIPCOM LLC is the OEM that can provide this product and these items.<br />Conventional amplitude squelch circuits used in receivers operate on the principal that the amplitude of a received signal must exceed a pre determined threshold before the squelch circuit will un-mute the receiver allowing audio to the speaker. While this method works well for VHF and above, it is unsuitable for &lsquo;our' use on HF. The static noise found in the HF bands causes the operator to set the &lsquo;adjustable' squelch circuit to respond to a higher amplitude in order to eliminate the static noise.<br />A noise compensated Syllabic Rate Squelch System (SRSS) circuit minimizes this problem by achieving a high sensitivity to voice signals while at the same time being insensitive to the type of noise typical on an HF circuit.<br />(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from a many potential sources a practicable.</p>
<p>Requirement shall be posted on to FEDBIZOPS. The posting will<br />include verbiage that any Offeror that feels that they can provide items that meet this requirement as stated may provide a quotation, and the Government will consider all offers.</p>
<p>(7) A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the purchase cost for these items will be the same or less than the General Public would pay for the same items in the Commercial Market place.<br />(8) Market Research</p>
<p>We have performed market research via the internet, phone and meetings, and found NO other products that perform similar functions.<br />(9) Any other facts supporting the use of full and open competition</p>
<p>None at this time<br />(10) A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>No other parties have expressed interest at this time.</p>
<p>(11) Removing Barriers to the Competition</p>
<p>None at this time</p>
<p>(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. The anticipated cost to the Government is determined to be fair and reasonable.<br />James A. Lassiter<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p>(13) Evidence that any supporting data is complete and accurate by the<br />technical or requirements personnel.</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET FOR REQUIREMENTS

It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Chad.B.Davis@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1200 Pacific Time on 03/27/ 2013.</p>

<DESC>It is the Government's intention to procure, via full and open competition, existing commercial vehicles with necessary modifications to meet the requirements identified in the Performance Specification (P-Spec). While the P-Spec provides the performance requirements for the P-19R the following paragraphs identify areas of particular interest to the Government.
<p>Firefighting Capability: The P-Spec identifies the required attributes and capabilities of the P-19 Replacement ARFF Vehicle (P-19R). In normal operational use all fire fighting and rescue efforts must be initiated within five minutes of notification of an incident. Firefighting apparatus must be able to initiate fire fighting and rescue operations within five minutes of notification from either a designated hotspot or from the supported airfield ARFF facility.</p>
<p>Transportability: The P-Spec states the P-19R should be C-17 transportable. It is also the Government's desire to have a vehicle that is similar in size to the current P-19A and weigh no more than 40,000 pounds while still meeting all other requirements of the P-Spec. Vendors should pay particular attention to the limitations for shipboard and rail transportation in the P-Spec and supporting documentation.</p>
<p>RAM: Reliability, Availability and Maintainability are key operational aspects of the P-19R. Vendors must be able to identify if their vehicle systems will be able to achieve the expected level of Material/Operational Availability, Reliability and Maintainability as identified in the P-Spec, based on the specified P-19R operational mission profile.</p>
<p>Fire Suppression System: Protection of the crew from vehicle fires is of special interest to the Government. The P-19A Replacement must meet all current applicable Standard NATO Agreements (STANAG), Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 414 Safety Regulations in effect at the time of production. In addition to meeting the above safety standards, the P-19R will, at a minimum, incorporate an Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) to protect the crew. If available, a system which combines the capabilities of an AFES and a system designed to prevent and extinguish exterior tire fires may be considered for incorporation into in the P-19R Responses should address the capability for adding such a system to the P-19R candidate vehicle, or identify if such a system is currently commercially offered.</p>

PROVISIONS/CLAUSES:  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference (provisions and clauses may be obtained via the internet: http://farsite.hill.af.mil): 
The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to offerors- Commercial applies to this acquisition
52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract or multiple awards resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, technical, past performance and price considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

BASIS OF AWARD:  1) The government intends to issue a firm fixed price contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation evaluation factors. 

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Offer that meets the technical aspects of the solicitation.  Competing offeror's technical aspects will be evaluated as significantly more important than past performance and price considerations. The lowest price proposal may not necessarily be selected; likewise, the proposal receiving the highest technical rating may not necessarily be selected. Offeror's who propose to perform the work for an unrealistically low price will not be considered for award. Where applicable, the techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1 will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness. An offeror's proposal shall represent the offeror's best efforts to respond to the solicitation. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offeror's must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: 

A.	Technical: Technical can be measured by the offeror's ability to perform requirements to meet technical, specifications, contract terms and conditions, and all local, state, and federal regulations as related to performing projects. 

B.	 Past Performance Confidence Assessment: 
1) Past Performance, the offeror shall provide relevant performance information on all offeror's based on (1) the past and present references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources as well as questionnaires. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving contracting support that is similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. Past Performance that does not meet the recency requirement, will be excluded from evaluation. 
2) Past performance will address areas pertaining to the following attributes to which an assessment will be made: 
3) Quality: The quality of work can be measured by how well the offeror conformed to or met contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g. commonly accepted technical professional, environmental, or safety and health standards.). 
TABLE 1- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS 
Rating 	Description 
SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
LIMITED CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
NO CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 
UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE 	No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. 

4) Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offeror's with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating ?Unknown Confidence, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. 
5) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP. For each effort evaluated, a relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners, will be made. In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply: VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. SOMEWHAT-RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs did not involve any magnitude of effort and complex.
6) Recent past performance is defined as past performance on contracts within the last three years from the issue date of this solicitation. Past performance for contracts exceeding the timeframe for this definition of recency will be excluded from evaluation. 
7) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a ?Substantial Confidence? performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Offeror to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items, Offeror must submit a completed copy of this provision with its proposal for the proposal to be considered. See https://orca.bpn.gov/ for online submittal);

FAR 52.211-6. <BR> <BR>Please provide all questions by 12:00 NOON EST Monday, March 4, 2013. <BR> <BR>QUESTION: Bilateral MRA with the European cooperation for the (EA).  This isn?t something that, to my know, exists any longer.  No US AB could fulfill that requirement, thus eliminating us all from the bid.  Participation in the ILAC MRA now satisfies that requirement. The EA bilateral agreement required that all ABs be non-profit and have no competition ? which is the case in the EU and many countries.  That is an impossibility in the US.  Competition eliminated all U.S. ABs whether you were a non-profit or not.  The participation in the ILAC MRA is all that is necessary.  The solution was for the EA to accept and participate in the ILAC MRA.  By doing so, the circumvention of the impossible requirement and restriction was bypassed.   Because competition is present in the US, any signee of the EA bilateral agreement was automatically in breach of the agreement.   Is this something we can have removed from the solicitation?
ANSWER: Reference to the EA has been removed from the SOW. <BR> <BR>QUESTION: The SOW refers to more information at the end of the document, but there is not such information at the end of the document: "...test methods under the chemical and mechanical test technologies or scopes of accreditation listed at the end of this document." Is there additional information that was left out or is there an additional attachment that is missing?
ANSWER: The attached document listing provides the chemical and mechanical technology scope for each laboratory. <BR> <BR>QUESTION: Does DHS expect the winning bidder to schedule, assess and issue accreditation prior to the existing accreditation expiration of 4/30/13?
ANSWER: CBP's intent is to award a purchase order before the end of March to allow the selected vendor to begin conducting laboratory assessments in late March/early April and proceed with the certification process effective 5/1/13. <BR> <BR>

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>Description  <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the Armament   <br>  Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Packaging Division, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000; is currently seeking sources to manufacture a total of  twenty  (20) M 548 ammunition containers for testing.  Ten (10) of the M 548 containers to be manufactured will be an improved design developed by ARDEC engineers and ten (10) will be of the standard design M 548 ammunition container for comparison purposes.   <br>    <br>  The ARDEC Packaging Division is responsible for the acquisition and fielding of state-of-the-art, commercial/non-developmental packaging solutions.  The improved design to the M 548 will reduce the amount of material that will be used on the body, reduce manpower costs,  shortening the welding process and also eliminate some of the issues regarding painting the body of the container.  <br>    <br>  The improved design M 548 Ammunition Container shall have the rub rail stamped into the body rather than as an external strip of metal welded onto the body of the container.  Government furnished property in the form of lids, hardware and gaskets for the containers will be provided.    <br>    <br>  Planned Acquisition: The solicitation announcement and release will include all pertinent information for interested sources to submit their best offers.    <br>    <br>  Submission Information: All interested sources should submit their responses to Mr. Gene Spillane at ACC-NJ via Eugene.G.Spillane.civ@mail.mil. Please include company name, address, telephone number, email address, technical point of contract and company size (please specify as either a Large Business, Foreign-Owned Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business).   Submittal of information is requested via electronic mail only, no later than 20 March 2013, 4:00PM Eastern Standard Time.   <br>    <br>  *Please note: This market survey is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a pre-solicitation notice, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION.  Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted as a result of this announcement.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a pre-solicitation notice will be published.  <br>    <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ) on behalf of the U.S. Army   <br>  Program Manager Close Combat systems (PM CCS) is conducting a Market Survey to   <br>  identify potential sources for the manufacture, inspection, testing, and delivery   <br>  of the family of Shoulder-Launch Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) Rounds:   <br>    <br>      <br>  1)	DODIC HX05, Rocket, 83mm, High Explosive Dual-Purpose (HEDP) MK3 Mod 0,   <br>  NSN: 1340-01-158-0577  <br>     <br>  2)	DODIC HX06, Rocket, 83mm, High Explosive Anti-Armor (HEAA) MK6 Mod 0,   <br>  NSN: 1340-01-227-8870  <br>    <br>  3)	DODIC HX07, Rocket, 83mm, Common Practice (CP), MK 7 Mod 0,   <br>  NSN: 1340-01-227-8871  <br>    <br>  4)	DODIC HA34, Rocket, 83mm, Novel Explosive (NE) MK 80 Mod 0,  <br>  NSN: 1340-01-503-0809  <br>    <br>  The Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) System is a direct fire,   <br>  infantry assault and armored vehicle weapon used to destroy fortified bunkers and   <br>  urban structures. The SMAW System is comprised of a reusable launcher, sight,   <br>  spotting rifle, and a family of four rounds. The four rounds come packaged one to   <br>  a disposable encasement, which comprises the rear half of the launch tube and is   <br>  packaged with a magazine of ammunition for the spotting rifle.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Each round is described below:  <br>    <br>  1.	The Rocket, 83mm, High Explosive Dual-Purpose (HEDP) MK3 Mod 0 is used   <br>  against bunkers, urban structures and light armor. It has a range from 17m to   <br>  500m. The Dual Mode warhead is loaded with 2.3 pounds of aluminized Composition   <br>  A-3 explosive. It automatically senses the target type and selects the mode   <br>  accordingly. Against hard targets (e.g. light armor, concrete, brick, etc.) the   <br>  warhead functions immediately upon crushing, allowing a good coupling of energy   <br>  into the target. Soft targets (e.g. sand bag covered bunkers) cause the warhead   <br>  to function in the delay mode. This delay allows the warhead to penetrate and   <br>  increases the heaving capability of the warhead. The spotting cartridge clip is   <br>  recessed into the foam spacer used to fill the space between end cap and the front   <br>  of the warhead.  <br>    <br>  2.	The Rocket, 83mm, High Explosive Anti-Armor (HEAA) MK6 Mod 0 consists of a   <br>  unitary shaped charge designed to go against armor. It has a range from 17m to   <br>  500m (250 m with a moving target). The warhead has a trumpet liner and Octol for   <br>  the explosive fill. It uses a probe mounted crush switch to increase penetration   <br>  by increasing stand-off. Due to the greater length of the round, the spotting   <br>  cartridge clip stored in cavity molded into the outside of the end cap.  <br>    <br>  3.	The Rocket, 83mm, Common Practice (CP), MK 7 Mod 0 is used for training and  <br>   simulates both the DM and HEAA rounds. It consists of an INERT warhead mounted to  <br>   the same rocket motor. The plastic warhead contains a marking powder to clearly   <br>  show point of impact during training. It is fired from the same encasement as the  <br>   tactical rounds and contains ballistically matched spotting rounds.  <br>    <br>  4.	The Rocket, 83mm, Novel Explosive (NE) MK 80 Mod 0 was developed to provide  <br>   enhanced blast capability against caves and urban structures. It has a range from  <br>   50m to 300m. It contains 4.0 pounds of PBXN-113 explosive. It is similar in   <br>  functioning to the HEDP although it is designed to function at higher impact   <br>  angles. The spotting cartridge rounds are held on the outside of the end cap in a   <br>  manner similar to the HEAA.  <br>    <br>  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code for the SMAW rounds is   <br>  332993, Ammunition (Except Small Arms) Manufacturing.  <br>    <br>    <br>  All responses should be prepared in MS Word or PDF format, limited to ten (10)   <br>  pages (test results may be included as attachments). Responses should also include   <br>  a cover letter (not included in the page count), and, at a minimum, address the   <br>  following:      <br>    <br>  1.	Provide sufficient information to support the company's claim that it   <br>  presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to produce the SMAW   <br>  Round variants. In addition to the SMAW Round variants, responders should offer   <br>  information on how training is performed using the CP Round training rockets. The   <br>  response shall indicate how the interested party(ies) have achieved a level of   <br>  technical maturity such that they are capable of meeting the above requirements   <br>  and successfully completing a Government Qualification program without additional  <br>   research and development.  <br>     <br>  2.	Provide a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes,   <br>  inspection capability, personnel, past experience, and current production   <br>  capabilities (including minimum sustainable and maximum attainable monthly   <br>  production rates of the above described rounds or any similar SMAW rounds).     <br>  In addition, provide a Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical   <br>  production.  <br>    <br>  3.	Provide a point of contact for your Company which will include: the   <br>  corporate point of contact's name, address, website (if available), phone number,   <br>  and email address.  Companies are to state their NAICS Code, Cage Code and Duns   <br>  Number.   <br>    <br>  4.	Provide the respondents business size as it applies to NAICS code 332993    <br>  and any socio-economic considerations.   <br>    <br>  5.	Provide history of similar services that your company has provided to   <br>  other government agencies or other non-government customers. If applicable, please  <br>   identify the agency or non-government customer. If you are unwilling to share   <br>  your customer's identity, please address whether your company offers the same or  <br>   similar services commercially (outside the federal Government.). If you elect to   <br>  identify your past and current customers to which you provided similar products,   <br>  include the customers/company name and point of contact, phone number and   <br>  address/e-mail where they can be contacted.  <br>    <br>  6.	Respondents should identify any subcontractors that would be utilized in   <br>  the production of  the SMAW rounds and approximate delivery of each item after   <br>  award.  <br>    <br>  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be   <br>  construed as a  Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the   <br>  U.S. Government.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  All   <br>  information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the questions and answers received in response to this pre-solicitation notice.<br><br>Questions <br>1. PWS Section 6.5 states that "offeror is to provide proposed Master PM Schedule"; for continuity of existing maintenance program, will Government provide existing schedule of maintenance, that an offeror can updated and modify has required? If not, will Government provide all equipment OEM maintenance documents for offeror to develop this Master PM Schedule based on the OEM recommendation? If Government cannot provide either of this information, then the incumbent contract may have an unfair advantage in the development of this Master PM Schedule. <br><br>2. Will Key Management Personnel or any personnel be allowed to work on this contract while waiting on final SECRET clearance? <br><br>3. Reference PWS Section 6.15; when is the due date for the System Operations Plan and Standard Operating Procedures for the LN2 system equipment (i.e., 30 day after contract start)? <br><br>4. Reference PWS Section 6.19; will the Government provide an estimated and/or average (over the last 3-4 years) number of under $2,500 (labor only) Incidental Repairs? <br><br>5. Reference PWS Section 6.21 and 6.22; Category 1 service orders are defined and Emergency and Category 2 is defined as Routine; the Government did not define the category for an Urgent. Is Urgent also defined as "service work must be performed immediately or loss of life, injury, impact to the mission, serious environmental impact or damage to real and installed property may result"? Or is Urgent defined as any situation that, if not corrected, could become an emergency? If there is a difference between emergency and urgent, then urgent should also have its own category and suspense time. <br><br>6. Are there any employees that are represented by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)? If so will the Government provide the CBA? <br><br><br><br>Government Response<br><br>1. ALC recommends that each bidder seeking OEM information to find the information online.<br><br>2. Key personnel without clearance will be able to work on the contract, however, they will need to submit the proper letters, security forms, fingerprints, and have an investigation initiated through OPM in order to<br>have access to work without an escort.  The Government will not provide escorts.<br><br>3. The work plan is part of the selection criteria.  The more detailed and well thought out work plan will 30 days after award is reasonable for a final draft of the work plan.<br><br>4. Incidental repairs are included in the current contract as a lump sum. The cost data for incidental repairs is not tracked/recorded by this office.<br><br>5. Emergency and Urgent have the same meaning in the PWS.<br><br>6. ALC has no requirement for any personnel to be represented by a collective bargaining agreement.<br><br>

<p><br />The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>

<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 19, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of these deliveries are to remote locations. USDA is currently gathering requirements to include quantities, locations and frequency to get a better idea on what the needs for fresh shell eggs will be. When responding to this RFI, please consider the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is your firm able to deliver shell eggs on the same truck as produce items? <br />2. Are there any limitations on frequency of deliveries and quantities for fresh shell eggs?<br />3. Does soliciting for fresh shell eggs as well as produce items limit your ability to offer?<br />4. If you are already delivering to these remote areas, will adding fresh shell eggs to the contract have an effect on your proposed pricing? If affirmative, please provide an estimate of any cost decreases or increases that may result (a simple percentage basis).<br />5. What are the financial risks, if any, in committing to a long term contract that included fresh shell eggs?</p>
<p>We encourage your participation; please share your ideas on the feasibility of supply fresh shell eggs. Your written comments, suggestions and ideas regarding this proposal will be treated as confidential and for Government use only. Please provide your responses via mail or email, by March 15, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. EDT to the following address:</p>

<p>Amendment 02 posted 29 August 2012 updated proposal preparation instructions.</p>
<p>Amendment 01 posted 29 August 2012 updated contact information for the Broad Agency Announcement.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>INTRODUCTION:<br /><br /></strong>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack.&nbsp; Please review the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (http://www.defense.gov/bmdr/) for details.&nbsp; The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, directed energy systems, interceptors, and command and control elements to engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from boost and early intercept phases through midcourse into terminal phase.&nbsp; MDA focuses efforts toward making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to counter a broad range of missiles, warheads and trajectories.&nbsp; The BMDS must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>MDA instituted the Missile Defense Agency Science and Technology Advanced Research (MSTAR) program to fund relevant Advanced Technology research and demonstration work at qualified accredited domestic colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning and to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.&nbsp; White papers must be for Advanced Research.&nbsp; This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is a recurring, competitive solicitation and contract vehicle enabling MDA to identify and acquire emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability and filling technology gaps.</p>
<p>MDA issues this BAA under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.&nbsp; Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA meet requirements for full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."</p>
<p>Any activity conducted on or resulting from funding on contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with United States Laws and regulations on "Export Control", including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).&nbsp; All technical documents produced on the contract shall be marked in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5230.24, unless the document is specifically approved by MDA for public release.&nbsp; The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will provide the appropriate 5230.24 distribution statement.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION:<br /></strong><br />MDA will review information regarding research conducted under MDA funded actions for possible publication or presentation in open or ITAR-controlled forums.&nbsp; Information regarding classified research shall not be published or presented in any unclassified forum.&nbsp; MDA has final authority on publication or release of any information related to research MDA funds, classified or unclassified, in any forum.</p>
<p>Only domestic accredited colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning registered by the U.S. Department of Education may submit white papers.&nbsp; Federal educational organizations such as the U.S. military academies must use a different application process; please contact the Contracts Point of Contact (POC) listed below for details regarding Federal educational organizations.&nbsp; If selected for contract award resulting from this BAA, the offeror must be a qualified education institution at time of award.&nbsp; If a white paper is based on a subcontract or teaming arrangement, the college, university or educational institution submitting the white paper must lead the effort and perform more than 50 percent of the effort by cost.</p>
<p>All contract awards are subject to official fiscal appropriation and availability of funds.&nbsp; For planning purposes, firm-fixed-price or cost reimbursement type contracts, cooperative agreements or grants are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts unless otherwise identified.&nbsp; We anticipate each MSTAR contract's funding at a maximum of $500,000 (two year period of performance) or $700,000 (three year period of performance). Funding ceilings are $250,000 a year during a two year base period of performance with a potential option for a third year of performance funded at a maximum of $200,000.&nbsp; Inclusion of options in any contract is at the discretion of the government.&nbsp; The government is also not obligated to exercise any option period included in an awarded contract.</p>
<p>MDA requires all lead Principal Investigators of institutions submitting a white paper under this program hold US citizenship.&nbsp; MDA desires all participating students conducting research for contracts sponsored under this program award to hold US citizenship.&nbsp; In addition, the government reserves the right to request special justification for considering any student who is a non-US citizen, including but not limited to individuals that obtain a valid Permanent Resident Card, commonly called a "Green Card", for participation in research for contracts sponsored through this program award. Foreign citizen students without valid Green Cards are ineligible for consideration and participation.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to notice of selection or non-selection for award.&nbsp; If selected for award MDA will request a full technical volume and detailed cost proposal.&nbsp; <strong>DO NOT SUBMIT THE TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THIS INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<p>The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of white papers and proposals submitted in response to this announcement.&nbsp; These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.&nbsp; Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offeror's acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e).&nbsp; The primary basis for selecting white papers will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Factors: <br /></strong>MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; Technical Merit is weighted 50% of the aggregate score; Capabilities 30% and Management 20%.</p>
<p><strong>(1)&nbsp; Technical Merit.</strong>&nbsp; Does the proposed research exhibit scientific and technical excellence with relevance and importance to MDA goals and programs?&nbsp; Does the proposed research offer innovative concepts, stimulating technology innovation, or exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to an element of the BMDS? Does the white paper succinctly illustrate and clearly identify the proposed technology as well as, its rationale, objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to MDA?</p>
<p><strong>(2) Capabilities.</strong>&nbsp; Does the offeror's key personnel have previous experience working with the proposed technology or similar technology?&nbsp; Does the white paper demonstrate the availability of adequate facilities and instrumentation to perform the proposed task successfully?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(3)&nbsp; Management.</strong>&nbsp; Does the proposed management plan and project timeline appear reasonable given the level of proposed work?&nbsp; <br />The BAA Selection Official will make selections based on the evaluation criteria noted above and MDA funding and technology priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rough Order of Magnitude Cost (ROCM) will be used to determine if there are sufficient funds available for the proposed effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />No further evaluation criteria will be used. The Government intends to evaluate and recommend awards based upon its evaluation of white papers without discussions; however, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.&nbsp; The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the white papers received in response to this announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT</strong></p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source contract pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, which applies when the supplies/services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate a contract with Riegl USA, Inc., (RIEGL) Orlando, FL, for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of National Geodetic Survey (NGS), to upgrade topographic Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system for the Remote Sensing Division. The requirement is for hardware and software components to upgrade existing RIEGL LMS-Q680i topographic LiDAR to a RIEGL VQ-820-G combination topographic-bathymetric LIDAR system with an option to upgrade a second topographic LiDAR system. This product provides the capabilities of simultaneously mapping both the subaqueous and subaerial areas of the coastal zone. In addition, it has high accuracy ranging based on echo digitization and online waveform processing with multiple target capability.

<p>General Description: The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139C/B is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to identify potential cost and/or schedule drivers that would impact a potential source from being able to build to the draft FMU-139D/B Performance Specification PMA201-12-001, or any other improvements that could be incorporated with minimal cost/schedule impact. The Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources which detail the below areas of interest. Responses shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how concepts were developed and methodologies used that could satisfy stated requirements, including a top level description of the proposed upgrade concept, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, verification and validation of capability concepts, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, future technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of any newly proposed concept including key subsystems and methodology used to determine TRL, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for any newly proposed concept and methodology used to determine MRL. Key areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Comments to DRAFT Performance Specification PMA201-12-001, including the identification of any requirements that are significant cost drivers. Provide specific cost/schedule impact with recommendations.<br />&bull; Hardened target capability to 10,000 PSI.

<DESC>Work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division (SWD) consisting of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the primary responsible agent for the Corps of Engineers via established agreements.  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed the geographical area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br>  <br>  <br> Any work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of  <br>  SWD and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the -One Door to the Corps- via established MOAs. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <br>    <br>  WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE ISSUED UNDER RFP NUMBER: W9126G-13-R-0014  <br>    <br>  Pre-solicitation Synopsis Notice   Small Business Request for Proposal (RFP) for  Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services for the United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) in Southwern Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas consisting of  Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.  <br>    <br>  The Contract Specialist point of contact for this anticipated solicitation will be Ms. Jennifer Fox at 817-886-1220, e-mail Jennifer.R.Fox@usace.army.mil.  <br>    <br>  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This Synopsis is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming.

The maximum combination of orders is $75,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.

The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   <br>    <br>  CONTRACT INFORMATION: Small Business solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as  quote mark Offerors quote mark ) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.

All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity  is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.      <br>    <br>  The total estimated contract capacity is $537,840,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.    <br>    <br>  The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive Small Businesses only.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract.   <br>    <br>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT<br>W9126G-11-R-0069<br>Questions:<br><br>19 Oct 11:<br>1. AEC SOUTHWEST DIVISION AND ITS SURROUNDING AREAS IDIQ TYPE CONTRACTS # : W9126G11R0069<br><br>Is this a new effort or was there a previous contractor that fulfilled similar requirements in the past?  If the latter, would you be able to inform me of the:<br><br>Contractor Name<br>Contract #<br>Value<br>Expiration Date<br><br>Also, the sources sought notice mentioned that there will be multiple pools; unrestricted and authorized set asides--would you happen to know if that means there will be more than one Solicitation released for this effort?  If that is the case, do you know how many Solicitations will be released and for which set-asides?  <br><br>ANSWER: This is a new effort for a new suite of MATOC contractors to replace the 2009 MATOC pools. There are numerous contractors. There will be an estimated five pools; Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HubZone and Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Business yet to be determined. There will be more than one solicitation issued but when solicitations are issued it will be decided before hand which pool will get that solicitation. In the end every pool will get a chance.<br><br>The 2009/2008/2006 MATOC pool of contractors; vertical construction with a base of one year plus 4 years.<br>Unrestricted (estimated max capacity of $370 Million)- <br>W9126G-09-D-0074 RQ Construction Inc; W9126G-09-D-0075 Spaw Glass Contractors, Inc; W9126G-09-D-0076 Satterfield & Pontikes Construction, Inc; W9126G-09-D-0077 Key Construction, Inc; W9126G-09-D-0078  ITSI American Reinvestment, LLC; W9126G-09-D-0079 Guyco, Inc; W9126G-09-D-0080 Watts-Weitz Joint Venture; <br>(estimated capacity of $450 Million)<br>W9126G-08-D-0073 J.

If so, could you please provide the Incumbent names as well as the contract number?<br> <br>Thank you for your time,<br>ANSWER: This is a new effort for s new suite of MATOC contractors to replace the 2009 MATOC pools. There are numerous contractors. See previous question for a list of contractors.<br><br><br>25 Oct 11:<br><br>If awarded such a contract, can the contractor turn down work which may be outside their bonding capacity?<br><br>Description states that the projects can be from 500,000 to 70,000,000 with each contractor being asked to perform on up to three project simultaneously.  <br> <br>Most small business cannot bond at the 70,000,000 level, but can bond at the 500,000 level...that is where the question above is relevant.<br> <br>What is the minimum bonding capacity required for the project?<br><br> ANSWER:  The $70M level will more than likely be reserved for the Unrestricted pool.  At this point please answer questions 1-6 on the sources sought with one of them asking what your bonding capacity is. This will help determine the appropriate method of setting aside portions of the requirements for small businesses. <br><br><br>28 Oct 11:<br><br>The sources sought synopsis states that the average size task order will be $20,000,000. It also states that it is anticipated that there will be multiple pools (unrestricted and authorized set-aside pools), with three to five contracts per pool. Please clarify the average task order size with respect to the type of pool:  Will the average task order size vary depending on the type of pool (i.e., 8a set-aside pool, HubZone set-aside pool, unrestricted pool, etc.)?  If yes, is it known at this time what the average task order size would be for each pool?<br><br>ANSWER:  AN AMENDMENT WILL BE FORTHCOMING CHANGING THE STATEMENT OF THREE TO FIVE CONTRACTS PER POOL TO AT LEASTTWO OR MORE CONTRACTS PER POOL AND IT IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME WHAT THE AVERAGE TASK ORDER SIZE WOULD BE FOR EACH POOL.<br><br>Will the proposed contracts for each pool (unrestricted and set-asides) cover the entire SWD geographic area, or is it possible that certain pools may cover only certain regions within the SWD area?<br><br>ANSWER: BOTH AREAS OF COVERAGE ARE POSSIBLE...THE MATOC CONTRACT POOLS MAY VARY...COVERING AN ENTIRE SWD GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR CERTAIN REGIONS WITH THE SWD AREA.<br><br> <br>31 Oct 11<br><br>Regarding this opportunity which is now processing a Sources Sought market survey, will the multiple pools mean that the pools will never be competing for the same project?  We are a design firm and will be asked to be the design sub-consultant for both a small business and a large business D/B teams.  If the pools are discrete and never compete for the same project, we can support both size general contractors in separate pools, but if they could pursue the same project among all pools, we would have a conflict and could only support one firm.  Please advise how the multiple-pool competition will work.  Thanks.<br><br> ANSWER: A Project will only be competed within one (1) MATOC pool, either the Unrestricted pool or one of the set-aside pools.<br><br>1 Nov 11<br>Assuming sufficient capabilities are determined will the RFP be two separate solicitations, one of an unrestricted pool and one for a restricted pool? The reason for my question is we would pursue both with the appropriate sized contractor but would not want to be in direct completion with each if they were both in the same pool. Tkg<br><br>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: The RFP will only be issued to one pool. Different pools will not compete for that same RFP. <br><br><br>2 Nov 11<br><br> Reference the Unrestricted portion of the W9126G-11-R-0069 sources <br><br>Looked over a list of existing unrestricted Fort Worth MATOC's and it looks like this will replace or share a similar capabilities with the "SWD Vertical Construction MATOC - Unrestricted Pool"   scheduled to expire in August of 2014.  <br><br>If awarded, is this seen as a replacement for the existing contract or a new initiative?  <br><br>ANSWER:  This will be used to replace the existing MATOC pool once capacity expires.<br><br><br>31 Oct 11<br><br>Our company is new to government contracting and government jobs. We just started looking in the government sector because of the opportunities for Service Disable Veteran Small Owned Businesses such as ours. I kind of have an idea what is going on from what I read in the synopsis but it also raised some questions.  <br><br>I would like to get more information on project - solicitation # : W9126g-11-R-0069. Such as:<br><br>Are you looking and or awarding for a Prime General contractor only? (Design/build)<br>Answer: Yes<br>	<br>Is there Prime contracting for design only?<br>Answer: No<br><br>Do you pair up prime general contractors with qualified subs?<br>Answer: No<br>	<br>As far as the working areas, we are based in San Diego Ca area, could we ask for the California contracts only? Our engineers are only license in California.<br><br>Answer:  No and your engineers can only practice in CA if that is the state they are registered in. It should become clearer when the actual solicitations are issued as far as where work can be performed but chances are the Contractor will have to perform in other than CA or multiple states/locations.<br>2 Nov 11<br>Could you please verify if the Sources Sought Synopsis for this opportunity is due on November 18th or November 30th? There are two different dates on the solicitation and we would like to respond.<br><br>ANSWER: November 30, 2011<br> <br><br><br>2 Nov 11<br>I am a Service Disable Veteran, a Veteran Owned, and a Disadvantaged Business owned business. I own a Construction Company and I am interested in working in TX, LA, NM, OK.I want to give you bids for al five-state region. I am a minority and I am expressing an interest and I hope that you will set aside some or all of this work for people with a small business.<br> <br>ANSWER: We will use the information gathered from this Sources Sought synopsis to determine the method of set-asides that will provide the greatest opportunity for all business concerns.  Please submit your capabilities statement and provide the information requested in the sources sought.  <br><br>3 Nov 11<br>Of the contract pools anticipated to be awarded from this solicitation, will any be specifically structured for 8(a) and Small Businesses? Also, will these small business pools be required to carry out the same task order sizes described in the solicitation, or will smaller task orders be offered for the Small Business?<br> <br>ANSWER:  The type(s) of set-asides and task order sizes will be based on the information obtained from responses to the sources sought and other market research being performed.  <br><br>7 Nov 11<br>I am interested in getting a synopsis package on the above project please advise me on what procedure I need to do.<br><br>ANSWER:  There is no "synopsis package" other than what has been published in FBO.  Please provide the information requested in the Sources Sought Synopsis.<br><br>4 Nov 11<br>Our company is a SDVOSB. Is it permissible to respond to the sources sought for W9126G-11-R-0069 as a team to show how we would actually execute Task Orders of the magnitude described in the pre-solicitation? <br> <br>ANSWER: Provide the information requested in the synopsis.  <br><br><br>15 Nov 11<br><br>We are an architecture firm and we are teaming with a contractor to submit for this Sources Sought.  For a Design-Build Source Sought must the Contractor be the main point of contact or can the Architect be it?  For a Design-Build Source Sought is "offerors" referring to both the contractor and architecture firm? If so, just for clarity purposes, I would provide offeror's name, address, and phone number for both contractor and architect correct?    I apologize for so many questions, but it is our first time filling out a Design-Build Source Sought.  Thanks so much.<br><br>ANSWER:  The Prime Contractor should provide a response to the sources sought. D-B teaming arrangements will be described during the solicitation process. <br><br><br>17 November<br>Where may I download a copy of Sources Sought Information Request Form<br><br>ANSWER:  There is no form.  Provide the information requested in the Sources Sought Synopsis. <br><br><br>17 November 2011<br>Do you happen to know if the seed project for the subject sources sought for the SWD IDIQ has been identified?<br><br>ANSWER:  This is a sources sought synopsis. The question is not applicable at this time.<br><br>18 Nov 11<br>What are the maximum, minimum and average task sizes for the Small Business ("SB") alternative IDIQ pools?<br>ANSWER: Sources sought states a minimum of $500,000 per task order, an average of $20 Million per task order and a Max task order of $70 Million.. The average task order size for for SB set-aside(s) will be approximately $10M.<br><br>If there is a seed task, what and where is the expected seed task for each of the IDIQs, both SB and Unrestricted ("UR")?<br><br>ANSWER: This is a sources sought synopsis  The question is not applicable at this time.<br><br>Will an SB be required to submit separate responses for separate SB pools or may it submit a single response identifying the various SB pools for which it is eligible?<br><br>ANSWER:  You may submit a single response for the sources sought and identify all set-aside categories that apply to your firm.<br><br> If an SB demonstrates sufficient capacity to participate in the UR pool, may it compete in both SB and UR pools using a single proposal or must the SB submit separately for each such solicitation?<br><br>ANSWER:  A SB firm may submit a proposal on the Unrestricted MATOC pool if the SB can meet the requirements (especially bonding capacity) for the Unrestricted pool.<br><br>Will offers be required solely in electronic form or will paper and electronic proposals be required?<br><br>ANSWER:  It is anticipated that offers will be requested in electronic format only..<br><br>Will Offerors be allowed to use the recently-issued USACE standard Past Performance Qualifications for relevant experience for which there is no CCASS/CPARS rating and no other equivalent on file?<br><br>ANSWER:  Yes.<br><br>Please confirm that all pools will be Best Value procurements, and not Low-Price, Technically Acceptable or other procurements, or specify the procurement form for any pool that will not be Best Value.<br><br>ANSWER:  The evaluation method for this requirement has not yet been determined.<br><br>Will the solicitation for UR and SB pools be single-step or two-step procurements?<br><br>ANSWER:   Not yet determined.  This will be identified when solicitations are posted.<br><br>If a solicitation is to be single-step, will the seed task be design-build or design-bid-build?<br><br>ANSWER: Not yet determined.  This will be identified when solicitations are posted.<br><br> If a solicitation will be two-step, what is the maximum number of firms that the government will advance for competition in Phase 2 in each of the SB and UR pools?<br><br>ANSWER:  Not yet determined.  This will be identified when solicitations are posted.<br><br>Will the government include an emphasis on Past Safety Performance in the solicitation (EMR, Total Recordable Incident Rate, etc.)?<br><br>ANSWER: Not yet determined. This will be identified when solicitations are posted.<br><br>Will the government provide parity between federal and similar non-federal experience or will one be scored higher?<br><br>ANSWER: Sources Sought states to submit capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity. At this point there is no"scoring."<br><br>Will the government identify prior project experience with hospitals, dormitories, hotels, and healthcare facilities - buildings with repetitive room construction, stacked utilities, central services, etc. - as similar experience to barracks construction?<br><br>ANSWER:   Not applicable during Sources Sought phase. <br><br>Will the government identify prior project experience with high-rise and other tall vertical construction projects having small floor plates and complex utility coordination as similar experience to air traffic control tower construction?<br><br>ANSWER:  Not applicable during Sources Sought phase.<br><br>What additional information can USACE provide regarding the distribution of likely projects by building type and geography?<br><br>ANSWER:  No further information can be provided at this time.<br><br>How many and what type SB pools are expected?<br><br>ANSWER:  The number and types of set-aside pools will be determined after analysis of responses to the Sources Sought and market research. <br><br>What approximate percentage breakdown between DHS and DoD facilities is currently expected over the life of the contracts?<br><br>ANSWER:  No further information can be provided at this time. <br><br>Will all contracts be for both DoD/DHS work or which contract pools, if any, will serve only DHS or only DoD projects?<br><br>ANSWER:  No further information can be provided at this time<br><br>With the holiday season fast approaching, what is the target date for any industry day, and what is the current procurement phase 1 and phase 2 schedules through Award and Notice to Proceed?<br><br>ANSWER:  No further information can be provided at this time<br><br>Will task assignments between UR and SB pools consider the relative complexity of the projects?

<DESC>Work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division (SWD) consisting of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the primary responsible agent for the Corps of Engineers via established agreements.  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed the geographical area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Any work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of   <br>   SWD and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the -One Door to the Corps- via established MOAs. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.   <br>      <br>   WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE ISSUED UNDER RFP NUMBER: W9126G-13-R-0014   <br>      <br>   Pre-solicitation Synopsis Notice   Small Business Request for Proposal (RFP) for  Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services for the United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) in Southwern Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas consisting of  Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.   <br>      <br>   The Contract Specialist point of contact for this anticipated solicitation will be Ms. Jennifer Fox at 817-886-1220, e-mail Jennifer.R.Fox@usace.army.mil.   <br>      <br>   FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This Synopsis is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming.  All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing via email to the Contract Specialist as noted above. Anticipated Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts are based upon the projected requirements for Southwest Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas.  Estimated value for this MATOC pool is $537,840,000.00.  This solicitation is one of four solicitations to be placed under the approved Acquisition Plan for construction within SWD and its surrounding areas.   <br>      <br>   SCOPE OF WORK:  Construction services are to include, but is not limited to: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.

The maximum combination of orders is $75,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of Small Business contracts will be firm-fixed price.  The minimum guarantee for the Small Business MATOC contract is $2,500 that applies to the base period only. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.    <br>      <br>   CONTRACT INFORMATION: Small Business solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as  quote mark Offerors quote mark ) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.     <br>      <br>   The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals:   <br>      <br>    	Phase 1 - VOLUME 1: Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach      <br>      <br>   	Phase 2 - Volume 2: Design Technical; Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Small Business Participation.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than Price (Volume 3).     <br>      <br>   Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 3/15/2013 under solicitation number W9126G-13-R-0014.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 09/13/2012.  (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit, it will be conducted after the Phase 2 selection has been made.  Details regarding the Conference will be provided by amendment to the solicitation.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.       <br>      <br>   MATOC:  Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505 Ordering and in accordance with the task order terms and conditions including the designated SOW.    All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity  is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.       <br>      <br>   The total estimated contract capacity is $537,840,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.     <br>      <br>   The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive Small Businesses only.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract.    <br>      <br>

<DESC>AMENDMENT TO SOLICITATION VA24813R0704
The purpose of this amendment is to address questions received to this solicitation.
Question #1:
Could you find out if the pricing we submit includes specialty amino acids and lipids; or, if we can add line items for them and additives afterwards?
Answer:  The amino acids and lipids should be included in the price.  All in one bag.
Question #2:
Will the VA like invoices monthly or every two weeks?  Will all invoices need to be approved prior to being sent to Texas so should they be sent to Bay Pines first?
Answer:  Billing will be monthly in arrears.  Invoices should be sent to the payment address in Block 18a on the 1449, which is Austin, TX.  Austin receives the invoices and electronically sends them to Bay Pines' Fiscal (Accounting) Department.  The Fiscal Department electronically forwards them to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and allows the COR five days in which to approve/deny/dispute.  Please send all invoices to Texas not Bay Pines.
Questions #3:
Can daily delivery cost be considered and added as a line item to Section "B" of the SF-1449 - Schedule of Supplies and Services and Prices/Costs?
Answer:  Yes, the product and delivery costs can be separated.  Please write delivery costs into the Base plus Two Option Year pricing into Section "B", if you wish, when submitting your RFP.
