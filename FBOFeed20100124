<DESC>The US Southern Command SOUTHCOM has an urgent and compelling sole source requirement for Information Technology Support Services in support of Operation Unified Response  Haiti.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.  Any responses to this synopsis will be separately addressed.  Operation Unified Response  Haiti has been declared a Contingency Operation. These services are required to provide Information Technology Support to personnel performing humanitarian aid operations in Haiti.  The Government intends to award a Sole Source contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation, the current provider of Information Technology Support Services at the SOUTHCOM Headquarters in Miami, FL.  The Government estimates that approximately 12,320 hours of a mixture of Information Technology Support will be required.  Lockheed Martin is providing the current IT Support for ASA/Miami.  Lockheed Martin is familiar with SOUTHCOM and Army Signal Activity (ASA) IT configurations, policies, procedures, and regulations.  No other provider can perform these additional services without both a substantial duplication of cost and an unacceptable delay.  No other provider is capable of providing these services immediately.  The period of performance for this effort will be approximately six months.  Inquiries to this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Christopher Murphy, Army Contracting Command Miami at Christopher.murphy@hq.southcom.mil, telephone 305-437-2669, fax 305-437-2752.
