<DESC>Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisitions Regulation Part 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation issued as DG1330-07-RQ-0007(GJB). This solicitation document incorporated Statement of Work, provisions and clauses. The provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12. NAICS number is 722320. The Government intents to award a Firm Fix Price contract.  

2006 NOAA Honor Awards Ceremony Caterer Selection. 

In the spring of 2007, NOAA plans to hold its annual Honor Awards ceremony.  This event consists of a breakfast in the morning from approximately 8:15 am through 9:45 am.  The breakfast must be able to feed approximately 1200 guests.  Following the breakfast is the awards ceremony itself, which will likely take place in a room/auditorium separate from the breakfast.  After the ceremony?approximately 11:45 am?there will be a small dessert reception to last until approximately 1:15 pm.

Breakfast

Ideally, NOAA would like to hold a hot, buffet-style breakfast with some seating but not enough chairs to seat the entire number of expected guests.  (NOAA approximates needing 200 seats as well as tables which can accommodate 200 seats placed around them).  If costs do not permit, NOAA is willing to hold a continental-style breakfast with similar seating arrangements.

The suggested breakfast items are listed below:

Hot Breakfast  	          Continental Breakfast
?Eggs	                ?Mini quiches (or equivalent finger food)
?Bacon	                .Fruit
?Hash Browns (Potatoes)	?Pastries
?Pastries  	        ?Coffee, Decaf
.Fruit          	?Tea
?Coffee, Decaf	        ?Water
?Tea	                ?Juice
?Water                   	
?Juice	

Note:  Disposables (plates, cutlery, etc.) can be used.  Please provide a quote for both the hot breakfast and the continental breakfast.

Dessert Reception

The dessert reception is informal and the seating from the breakfast can be used.  The dessert reception should consist of brownies, cookies, petit fours, etc.  Water, coffee, tea, and decaf should also be served.  The reception can also consist of a cake (or several) as well as fruit.

Again, disposables can be used.  

Equipment

The caterer must be able to provide the chairs and tables (seating for approx. 200) for the breakfast/reception.  The caterer should also provide the tables and equipment needed for serving the food.  Seasonable linens should be provided for the buffet tables as well as for the guest tables.

The caterer should be able to deliver most of this equipment (everything except for perishables) the day prior to the event?we anticipate the event will take place on May 11 so equipment deliveries should take place on May 10.

All deliveries must be made on the load-in day between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm so that the equipment is set-up and ready for the next morning by 5:00 pm.  On the day of the event, the equipment must be picked up no later than 2:15 pm..

Location of Ceremony

National Society Daughters of the American Revolution
DAR Constitution Hall
1776 D Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20006-5303

Staff

The caterer should provide all staff necessary for delivering the equipment, setting up the day before the event, and serving the food/maintaining the buffet tables.

Basis for Award:

Award will be made on a best value basis taking into consideration approach which includes items such as customer service, planned presentation, food selection, past performance, and price.  We are seeking an elegant presentation at a modest price.

Contractors? quotations must include pricing for the food, equipment (including linens), and delivery and must include the items that will be provided for the price.  Labor prices and hours must also be included.  A complete description of the services proposed, along with the name and resume/credentials of the catering coordinator should be provided.  

Your proposal should include at least three past performance references (include names and phone numbers and brief description of event that you have provided similar in nature).  Quality of the approach and past performance are considered to be more important than price.  However, the closer quotations are in terms of the quality of approach, the more important price will become.  Be sure to carefully address all elements in this RFQ so that your quotation can be fully evaluated.


The Government reserves the right to award without discussion; therefore each offeror is encouraged to submit their best terms with their proposal.     Special attention is directed to FAR 52.212-1 (b).     Failure to submit the required information for evaluation may render the offer non-responsive.   Offerors shall include a fully executed copy of the FAR provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their offer.    FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

BRAND NAME ONLY JUSTIFICATION:  The USAF Academy, Department of Chemistry has a Brand Name Only requirement to procure a Thermo Electron Model Evolution RC Centrifuge that will be utilized using existing rotors in their current inventory.  This acquisition is to replace a low speed centrifuge with a high speed centrifuge that utilizes the same rotors.  All the rotors used in the equipment in the biochemistry lab are interchangeable, so it is necessary to purchase the same brand name product as a replacement.  The Thermo Electron model Evolution RC Centrifuge meets all below-stated requirements and is therefore the instrument of choice for a BRAND NAME purchase by the United States Air Force Academy Department of Chemistry.   BRAND NAME purchase of a One (1) Thermo Electron model Evolution RC Centrifuge that will be used in all biochemistry lab courses, Chem 440, Polymer Chemistry, Chem 465, Material Science and Chem 499 Independent Research:  Specifications must be able to meet the following criteria:  A. The Air Force Academy, Department of Chemistry currently has four centrifuge rotors with a value of approximately $20,000 that operate in a Thermo Electron (previously Sorvall) Instruments.  B. The centrifuge system must be able to reach a max speed of 26,000 RPM without the use of a vacuum pump.  C. The centrifuge system must have at least a 3.5 hp motor and 2.0 hp compressor for maximum performance and to accelerate large volume rotors more quickly.  D. The centrifuge system must have a strong, imbalance-tolerant drive system including a brush-less motor design that provides a gyro that flexes in two places to accommodate any misalignment or imbalance.  This capability will compensate for balance errors and protect the equipment from severe damage. E. The centrifuge system must contain heating and cooling capability, providing quick temperature response and superior temperature control. F. The centrifuge system must contain a built-in electrical management system to ensure peak instrument performance, even under poor power supply condition. System must accept input voltage varying from 187-253 volts without speed or temperature control degradation.  G. The centrifuge system must have a ?lift over? profile no greater than 33 inches. This ergonomic feature provides a safe working height for instrument users. H. The centrifuge system must be extremely easy to load and clean, with a retractable chamber door that slides completely out of the way.  The centrifuge must have ?hands-free? access to the rotor chamber. I. The centrifuge system must have an integrated rotor lid holder to facilitate access to samples. J. The centrifuge system must have a 6 liter rotor that is bio-contained and does not require additional canisters. K. The centrifuge system must have multiple slow-start/slow-stop features to prevent gradient disturbance during acceleration and deceleration. L. The centrifuge system must have an easily accessible RCF (Relative Centrifugal Force) feature that automatically calculates and displays the corresponding RCF value for any selected rotor and speed setting. M.  The centrifuge must accept ?system integrated? SUPER-LITE? Composite and SUPER-LITE? aluminum rotors allowing for faster acceleration and deceleration times, with accurate temperature control.  No canisters or additional subassemblies should be required. N.  The centrifuge system must come with a standard warranty of one (1) year on the instrument, three (3) years on the drive and five (5) years on the refrigeration.  (None will be prorated.)
