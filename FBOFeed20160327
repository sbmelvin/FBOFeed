This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version  of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or
manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other
sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source  part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered  and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review   discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained. The subject item requires Government source
approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the
technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the
Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval  of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together
with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures  identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's
experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being
evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to
provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous  submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be
considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a   source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or  approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to   meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue
based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification
