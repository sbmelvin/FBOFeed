<DESC><p>This effort is for repair, refurbishment, and relocation of Air Force Noise Suppressors (commonly known as Hush Houses). The four noise suppressor configurations to be covered by this acquisition are designated as the T-9 (4920-01-082-1095RN), T-10 (4920-01-127-4640RN), T-11 (4920-01-070-2721RN), and T-12 (4920-01-286-8681RN). Repair, refurbishment, and relocation shall require the Contractor to conduct mechanical, electrical and all other types of repairs/refurbishment that are required for Air Force Noise Suppressors (excluding pneumatic fire suppression systems) worldwide in order to restore and maintain complete operational capability. This effort may include some application code analysis of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) functions in many upgraded T-9, T-10 and T-11 Noise Suppressors. The Air Force currently operates Noise Suppressors throughout the United States and in Europe, Japan, and Korea. All Noise Suppressor repairs shall be accomplished at each Noise Suppressor location. Refurbishment if required, can be accomplished off-site and installed (or reinstalled) at required location.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 236210 (Industrial Building Construction); the Small Business Size Standard is $33,500,000.00 in average annual receipts for the last three years. This project will be solicited as a 100% Small Business (SB) set-aside, with the intent to award a five year, firm-fixed-price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. The successful offeror will be selected based on an evaluation of proposals utilizing the "Performance/Price Tradeoff" source selection procedure.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - APG on behalf of the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Science and Technology Division (STD) proposes a non-competitive Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract with BAE Systems, 6315 Hillside Court, Columbia, Maryland 21046 for the purpose of engineering, development and delivery of a ruggedized prototype system, for vehicle-mounted standoff imaging and detection of explosive threats.  The prototype developed under this contract will improve upon BAE Systems previously developed HEIMDALL system, which combines unique salient characteristics of light weight, portability, full-spectrum hyperspectral imaging and real-time image processing.  The previously developed BAE system collects Visual Near Infrared (VNIR) and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) full-spectrum hyperspectral imagery, broadband visible imagery, and broadband Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) imagery from a mast-mounted moving vehicle payload, then stores and processes the imagery onboard the vehicle in real-time, providing real-time target nominations for immediate action.  While not yet ruggedized for field use or on-the-move operation, BAE's system uniquely combines, in mature form, the critical hyperspectral imaging and real-time imaging processing capabilities that the new system will need to detect relevant threat signatures from ground-mobile vehicle platforms. Only BAE's existing HEIMDALL system is deemed sufficiently mature to incorporate the necessary improvements, such as night capability, optimized optics, geolocation, ruggedized stabilization suitable for vehicle mounting and integration, with existing and ready-proven critical enabling technologies such as rugged miniaturized spectrometer and real-time processing capabilities, and to enable delivery of a vehicle integrated and tested prototype needed to meet delivery requirements within the total 12-month timeframe required of mission objectives.<br><br>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal and does not constitute a solicitation. However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully perform the effort may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be no longer than five (5) pages and submitted within 45 days after the publication of this synopsis.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to the following e-mail address:  charlene.buduo@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.

(See MIL-DTL-31000C, section 3.6.1 for Developmental and Product drawing definitions).
2)	Technology/Technical Approach:  Weight reduction that is accomplished solely by removing steel from a barrel (e.g. fluting, tapering) is not considered an alternative to current Army barrel technologies/configurations and does not meet the requirements of this contract.  The barrel hardware shall be composed of materials other than commonly used barrel materials (i.e. stainless or chrome moly).  Applicable technologies/processes include, but are not limited to, carbon fiber wrapped or low density alloy composite barrels and/or new manufacturing methods that enable the use of alternative barrel alloys to reduce weight and maintain or improve barrel stiffness.
3)	Chamber dimensions.  The chamber shall conform to the chamber dimensions and tolerances as specified in ANSI/SAAMI 2299.4 for .300 Winchester Magnum Ammunition.  All chambers must be cut short. Customer will perform final chambering when mated with existing receiver.

5)	Barrel length:  The barrel length shall be 23.5 to 24.5 inches when measured from the bridgeface of the bolt to the end of the barrel face.
6)	High Pressure Resistance:  All delivered barrels shall be capable of withstanding the proof firing of one proof cartridge derived from service load standard deviations as specified in ANSI/SAAMI 2299.4 using Mk248 MOD 1 (DODIC AB43, 220 grain) ammunition as the service load.  Barrels shall be free of cracks after proof firing as evidenced by visual and magnetic particle inspection.
7)	The contractor shall deliver five (5) barrels to the government.
8)	All deliverables are due within 90 days after contract award to US Army with acceptance at destination.

<SUBJECT>Chemical Monitoring for Organic Vapors in Respirator Cartridges

<RESPDATE>052711
<ARCHDATE>08312011
<CONTACT>Margaret L Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for Chemical Monitoring for Organic Vapors in Respirator Cartridges.<br /><br />Background and Scope:
<p>NIOSH approves respirators for the protection of workers against airborne contaminants. In 1998, OSHA revised its regulations on how chemical cartridges for respirators are selected and used. The new regulations require either end-of-service-life indicators (ESLI) or change out schedules to determine when cartridges must be replaced. Such schedules rely on mathematical models that are subject to environmental uncertainties. ESLI are not widely available and there are no ESLI's for organic vapors. As a result, cartridges are either replaced too frequently and hence add to the cost of protection or not frequently enough which can result in worker overexposure. In the former case, excessive cost could lead to less frequent change outs. Hence, either approach may result in reduced respiratory protection for the affected workers.</p>
<p>The proposed project uses an emerging technology known as microelectromechanical systems (MEMs) devices to constantly monitor the loading condition of a cartridge. This device will generate information to provide the user with information about the condition of his/her cartridge. It is anticipated that this technology can be implemented in a cost effective manner and will provide the user with accurate feedback pertaining to the end of life of the respirator cartridge in use.</p>
<p>Description of Research<br />Chemical sensors have been developed for integration in monolithic complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies as a low-cost platform for monitoring toxic gases and vapors in respirators. The approach was to merge chemically sensitive nanostructured polymers or mono layer protected metal nano particles with CMOS microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), where both base technologies already exist at Carnegie Mellon. Monolayer protected nanoparticles were synthesized and deposited on prefabricated electronic and MEMS devices. Several sensor modalities have been explored, including conductivity changes and gravimetric changes as a function of gas and vapor concentrations. However, the focus in this project will be exploring improvements in conductivity measurements by adding a preconcentrator to the system. This work will also entail the development and construction of an electronics package that will operate the capcitive chemical sensor that CMU developed under a previous contract. <br />The major tasks will consist of the following:<br />Tests will be conducted on existing preconcentrator samples with pore coatings in our vapor flow testbed. The test bed has been updated with hardware to enable very low flow rates necessary for lab testing of the preconcentrator. VOC vapors from the preconcentrator will be monitored downstream with chemical sensors, such as chemiresistor or chemicapacitor. The tests will provide output pulse vapor concentration vs time. Evaluation of the data is expected to provide a quantitative assessment of the concentration amplification from the preconcentrator unit.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2011-Q-13443. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mining Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to West Virginin University (WVU) for Advanced Numerical Analysis of Coal Mine Support Systems.<br /><br />Background and Scope:
<p>Ground falls remain the highest single cause of fatalities and injuries in underground coal mines. Over the five year period, 2003 to 2007 falls of ground were responsible for 40% of all fatalities in underground coal mines. In addition, approximately 1,500 unplanned roof falls are reported annually in underground coal mines. Each of these roof falls represents a failure of the installed roof support systems.<br />At present, no systematic or universally-accepted practice exists in the coal industry for roof support design. Support design is largely based on local experience or empirically derived methods, such as the Analysis of Roof Bolts (ARBS) method developed by NIOSH. Issues with current design practices include difficulties in quantifying: the contribution of each support element and the effect of supplementary supports, support capacity and stiffness requirements for given rock conditions and the impact of variable rock conditions on the impact of the support intervention. The relatively high rate of ground fall incidents and unplanned roof falls indicate that improved support design strategies are needed to address these issues.<br /><br />The work consists of three separate tasks. Task 1 is the modeling of bolt shear loading and it will include reviewing literature, model code evaluation, testing and sensitivity analysis, and comparative evaluation of FLAC3D and 3DEC analysis in order to provide recommendations for modeling bolt lateral shear in full scale entry models. Task 2 consists of development of a spreadsheet program that allows calculation of friction angle, cohesion, volumetric strain, dilation angle and Poisson's ratio evolution from the results of a multi-stage triaxial test that require minimal user intervention. Task 3 is to conduct a numerical modeling analysis of a published case study of rock bolt performance in a coal mine using modeling procedures and model development tools provided by NIOSH with the objective to calibrate the models against field performance.</p>
<p>West Virginia University, Dr. Keith Heasley, Professor, Department of Mining Engineering through regular involvement in the development of NIOSH numerical modeling techniques can provide the required service with minimal familiarization and background study that would be required by other contractors who did not partake in the continued development of NIOSH numerical modeling efforts. The proximity of West Virginia University to the NIOSH Pittsburgh campus allows face to face meetings to be held without incurring excessive travel expenses.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, Kim Diercks<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-9018<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: Kim.Diercks@usafa.af.mil</p>

Incoming Facility O&M contractor(s) require time to become familiar with ATSPCs aging and sometimes obsolete building systems, their operation, and maintenance; obtain required IRS background clearances; obtain training; etc., which is typically accomplished during the 60-day contract start-up or phase-in period prior to the contract effective date. Awarding the interim contract to other than the incumbent contractor heightens the Governments risk of encountering performance problems, or major system problems at this IRS center responsible for serving thousands of IRS employees throughout the southeast. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. No solicitation document is available. Interested parties may submit their interest and ability to meet IRS needs. However, responses received by noon May 16, 2011as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE. <br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to solicit proposals from sources for support for interdisciplinary studies. This support services contract is essential for GEB to maintain its program of family studies and to develop strategies for larger population studies. Family studies are an important platform for discovery of genetic variation related to cancer. They are also an important component of the NCI's focus on consortia, and represent a paradigm of collaborative, coordinated efforts with multiple extramural colleagues. This project is also responsive to Congressional mandates in that we are focusing on melanoma and lymphoproliferative disorders. <br /><br />The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international family studies and field (case-control and cohort) studies. All of the studies are interdisciplinary, most with biospecimen collection. Since 2005, the contract has actively assisted in the conduct of over 24 investigations, including all of our family studies activities. For planned new studies, as well as for ongoing studies, the overarching scientific goals are: to map and identify cancer susceptibility genes within high risk families; to assess penetrance and modifiers of penetrance in mutation carriers; to elucidate the natural history and define clinical spectrum of disease for specific conditions; to evaluate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions when possible in families and larger populations; to evaluate the significance of mutations in identified genes within larger populations.<br /><br />The acquisition will contain Mandatory Criteria's that must be met at the time of receipt of technical proposals: <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Frequent Face-to-Face Discussions<br /></span>The offeror must demonstrate how it will accomplish the task of attendance at face-to-face discussions, on a nearly daily basis, between the NCI project officers and the Project Director and/or nursing staff or project managers of individual studies in order to monitor and review progress on project activities.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Nearby Family Studies Medical Record Room<br /></span>The offeror must demonstrate how it will maintain the Family Studies Medical Record Room at a secure location which will assure that patient records will be delivered to the Project Officer at the Executive Plaza North Building, 6120 Executive Blvd, Rockville, Maryland within thirty (30) minutes of a request.<br /><br />The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and 6 (six) 1-year options of performance beginning on or about September 1, 2011.<br /><br />The RFP will be available electronically on or about May 26, 2011 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with San Francisco State University, Office of Research & Sponsored Programs, 1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94132 to perform an Epidemiologic Health Study of Manganese Exposure in East Liverpool, Ohio. This study will evaluate whether long term (minimum 10 years) residential airborne Mn exposure can affect human health, and will compare already available Marietta and Mt. Vernon adult resident results with those of East Liverpool for biomarkers (blood metals, toenails, hair), medical tests (symptoms; illnesses; Unified Parkinson?s Disease Rating Scale evaluation), functional tests (mood; neuropsychological tests such as working memory and attention, verbal skills, motor dexterity/strength, visual tracking speed); and questionnaires (life style habits; work; dietary Mn).  The data from Marietta and Mt. Vernon is proprietary to San Francisco State University due to patien t confidentiality. Therefore, EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of conducting this study. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  The anticipated period of performance is a 12 month base period. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored. The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Jeffery Clodfelter (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (PM CATT), Assistant Program Manager for Close Combat Tactical Trainer (APM CCTT) has a requirement for the award of a single Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide non-personal technical support services for Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS).<BR><BR>The CCTT is the first member of the CATT family of virtual simulators for collective training.  It supports training of armor, mechanized infantry, cavalry units, and recon units from platoon through battalion/squadron echelon, including staff.  The primary training audience operates from both full-crew simulators and mock-up or real command posts.  Simulators have sufficient fidelity for individuals and crews to accomplish their collective missions.  There are multiple projects under CCTT which include concurrency upgrades, convoy training, and a new Dismounted Soldier module.  The PDSS for CCTT is responsible for providing all aspects of software support to CCTT and its subsystems in order to maintain its main mission of providing a virtual collective training capability.<BR><BR>The Contractor shall perform system and software engineering, life cycle software support, testing, quality assurance, configuration management, replication, distribution, installation, training, and publications support.  The Contractor shall also provide trained labor, tools and test equipment, and materials to maintain and support the CCTT PDSS equipment (i.e. M1A2, M2A3, M2A2, FISTV, After Action Review (AAR) workstations, Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) workstations, Computer Generated Forces (CGF) computers, and others) for PDSS technical support services and other PM CATT contractor personnel performing work on the CCTT program or other Government contracts.  This effort in the future may include the PDSS for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Synthetic Environment Core (SE-Core) database production capabilities and other PM CATT programs that require PDSS activities.<BR><BR>Acquisition Approach:<BR>The Government anticipates a single IDIQ contract 8(a) set aside with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Reimbursement, and Time and Materials (T&M) Task Orders for technical support services.  The base period of performance (PoP) is one (1) year from contract award with four (4) one year option periods.<BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice

This Pre-solicitation Notice is being posted in advance of Solicitation No. M67854-11-R-2306 for Post Delivery Software Support (PDSS) and Systems Engineering support to PM MC2S for Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC)/Joint Tactical Common Operational Picture (COP) Workstation (JTCW) Client and Gateway (C&GW) and Command and Control Compact Edition (C2CE).  

Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement to procure and intends to issue a solicitation for in-service systems engineering support, software engineering support and adaptive and preventative maintenance to include technical assistance in software integration, Software Trouble Report (STR) root cause isolation, STR correction, software testing, impact analysis, software delivery and software documentation.
  The PDSS and Systems Engineering Support will be procured under competitive procedures.  Utilizing the trade-off process described in FAR 15.101-1, the best value for the Government will be obtained.  Best Value award will be to the responsive and responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified in the solicitation.  This procurement is expected to result in one contract.  The contract will commence in the 1st Quarter of FY12. A "C" type contract will be issued with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Cost type CLINS.

JTCW provides a framework for enhanced systems interoperability and commonality between MAGTF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems.
  The JTCW is a Windows-based tactical COP workstation suite of applications designed to facilitate military C2 functions by improving SA and enhancing operational and tactical decision-making.  The primary software component of JTCW is C2PC.  C2PC consists of the Client and Gateway.  The Client provides Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for Application Extensions (AEs) to interact with the map and other features of the Client.  The Gateway offers a unique capability for JTCW, allowing the Client to receive data from an Intelligence-Operations System (IOS) or Global Command and Control System (GCCS).  The Gateway provides the ability for a host of connection options: from the GCCS and IOS, to other Gateways.
  The Client provides the Marines with a disconnected network capability.  This functionality can be used at various echelons.  Upon establishing connectivity, the Gateway can reconnect without the need to reconfigure Clients.  The Gateway is used throughout the Marine Corps, and across Services.  JTCW is the primary point of entry for the COP where users are able to view map data, view and update track data, develop and distribute overlays, exchange general message traffic, plan and distribute route information, and conduct general C2 planning.  The addition of JTCW AEs, with other applications and services to the core software provides the functionality that enhances JTCWs ability to meet directed JTCW operational requirements.
  

C2PC is a very complex software application and is comprised of about 2.8 million lines of code that includes a significant number of modules, injectors, folders and interfaces.  The government has government purpose rights to the source code and technical data package.  The C2PC code is based on a Component Object Model (COM) framework, and is written in C, C++, C#, and JAVA languages.  The government will retain government purpose rights on any software modified or developed for this effort.

The C2CE software was developed to complement C2PC on a Personal Data Assistant.  The C2CE application allows for the display of digital maps produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and display of the users position.
  When connected to a combat net radio, an operator can utilize C2CE to create, transmit and receive Variable Message Format (VMF) messages, FREE TEXT messages and display tracks/positions of other users.

The planned schedule for C2PC anticipates one major release and one minor release per year, approximately every six months.  A Major release is equivalent to a destructive (full installation) load, and includes Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), Information Assurance requirements, user interface improvements, and interoperability enhancements.  Minor releases are non-destructive changes to existing installed software and address Information Assurance requirements, interoperability, and maintenance.
  The planned schedule for C2CE would be on an exception basis and would occur no more than once per year, if required.

Solicitation Number M67854-11-R-2306 is anticipated to be issued within the next 30 days and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https: www.neco.navy.mil. Offerors are instructed to hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued. No phone calls will be accepted. In order to be eligible for award, interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (CCR), http://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.

D.  SPECIFIC MANDATORY TASKS AND ASSOCIATED DELIVERABLES

1) Equipment/Device Specifications:  There are several commercially available health monitoring stations (kiosks) identified that provide the health monitoring devices in an integrated station desired by VHA.  As discussed at D.3), the Station must be equipped with 'Required' monitoring devices.  The required devices include:

1.	Required Devices with direct measurement systems include:
a.	Body Weight 
b.	Blood Pressure
c.	Heart Rate

2.	Required Calculated biometrics include:
a.	BMI
b.	Body fat

3.  The system functionally specifications described at '4. Functionality' is required.  

Vendors may provide additional monitoring devices/capability beyond what is required, if the Vendor's standard model provides monitoring capacity beyond stated requirements.  As discussed at D.3), Vendors must clearly identify the price with required equipment, and price with optional devices (if so provided) in ' Schedule of Deliverables & Pricing'.

Many health station systems on the market provide internet access to on-line health information and also provide web-based storage of user information.  Our specifications do not request internet access; therefore, Stations must have on-board capacities (note that Internet connection hardware/software of the Station doesn't need to be disabled by our specs, but most locations where Stations will be placed will not have internet connectivity, so on-board storage is necessary for reference health risk information and profile storage).

Each Station will be a free-standing/stand-alone unit.  The unit will have a completely integrated design and construction, preferably in once piece and have the appearance of a designed structure rather than a collection of components, including the seat/scale portion.  Monitoring devices and readout panels/display screen will be fixed to the station with well designed and flexible ergonomic access for female and male adults through the average height distribution. 

2)  Station Structure:  The Frame, enclosure and work area must be:

1.	Commercial grade, sturdy, durable and sleek construction
2.	Free standing design constructed or connectable as one unit and enclosed
3.	Smooth appealing surface textures and rounded edges in user area
4.	Durable, washable and easy to maintain and clean surfaces
5.	Easy access to seating and devices for users
6.	Wheel chair accessible seat
7.	Comfortable seat
8.	Footprint: 
a.	Length & width dimensions up to 42"
b.	Height up to 72"

3)  Monitoring/Measurement Devices (Required & Optional):  Devices and components will be an integrated design and:

1.	Any medical monitoring device included will be FDA cleared Class II medical device as applicable to the device

2.	Required Devices with direct measurement systems include:
a.	Weight 
b.	Blood Pressure
c.	Heart Rate
c.	Required Built-in Seated Weight Scale
d.	Required Calculated biometrics include:

ii.	Body fat

3.	Optional devices (Inclusion of optional devices is not required in the Vendor's proposal, but Stations offered with option devices will be considered.  Please note if your proposal includes optional devices listed below, and provide price with and without optional devices as noted in  Schedule of Deliverables & Pricing'.

a.	Direct measurement
i.	Temperature 
ii.	Eyesight

4)  Integrated Components:

1.	Display: Commercial grade easy to read flat, bright, high contrast, non-glare/privacy screen LCD display at least 15" in 4:3 or 16:10 display standard size format, enclosed within the station.
2.	Touch screen display menu or readily observable touch buttons on a console that will allow users to perform a single device measurement or all device measurements in a single session with screen display and print output on request.
3.	Printer: commercial grade monochrome laser (600 dpi) or equivalent, enclosed within the station with standard letter size sheet output (250 page capacity minimum) and readily available non-proprietary consumables.
4.	Onboard diagnostics:  Displays that indicate malfunction of any component with a reference error code to identify the issue.
5.	PCU: A system that communicates with and manages the integrated station systems devices, measurements, user input, session reports, storage and printing.
6.	Keyboard or input controls:  Input devices that allow users to use devices and obtain information, establish a profile and provide administrative control.

8.	One 110v/120v AV power cord for the station electrical connection.

4)  Station Functionalities (Required):

The core function of the health monitoring station is quick, easy and reliable monitoring results reported to the employee by screen display and printed results on request.  The station must function in a stand-alone mode without connection to network systems or the Internet.  The display/control panel must provide easily understandable menus on the display monitor with touch screen menu or on a console display with instructions/controls that prompt users to begin and provide next step prompts on Station use. The Station will have a demonstration mode on system use and features.  The Station will have audio for the demo mode, instructions and menu display prompts, but audio will not broadcast measurements or results.

The Station input menus will allow employees to run a user session in a direct report or saved session data mode if a profile is established.  For the save session data mode, users may first establish a profile to store session results. The user profile for storing session data and evaluating results must not request personal identifiable information such as real name or birth date.  Allowable menu driven inputs for the user profile are user name, gender, age range (5-year intervals, e.g. 50 to 54 years) and height.  The user will be prompted to select a non-identifiable name (not their real name) known only by themselves and a password. Employees will be allowed to enter, store and retrieve saved data.  

On-board storage for session data and reference health (evidence based) information will be provided.  User menus will prompt users to select an optional health risk report based on session observations.  The health risk report may be displayed and/or printed, but not saved in the profile.

The Station will have an Administrator mode that will allow maintenance and file cleanup.  User profiles will not be available to the Administrator, thought in this mode user summary reports will be provided and profiles, while not accessible to open may be deleted by the Administrator.  Administrator summary reports will include:

1.	Number of sessions by date range
2.	Average session duration by date range
3.	Number of user profiles by date range
4.	Number of sessions per user profile
5.	Average time of logged in sessions
6.	Number and type of reports printed

Optional HMS Functionality

The Station may have (not required) menu driven interactive options based on session data, which allow the user to select dietary and exercise goals, and identify healthy dietary and exercise strategies helping one to reach these goals.  Users would have the option of printing these reports.  The user session will end when the user signs out, or anytime the station seat is unoccupied for 30 seconds.  If this dietary and exercise goals feature is included in your offer, complete the Optional 

4)  Appearance and Branding:

Appearance is difficult to quantify, but the appeal of the Station to users will be a decision factor.  The appearance of the Station should be inviting to employees and conducive to use.  Devices should have a professional quality look and feel.  Vendors must provide prototype photos of the Station's appearance and brochures (if available) of the equipment to be provided in the proposal.  

1.	Branding:  The Station will be provided with the following branding:

a.	Logo: ( 3" to 4 " gray scale graphic attachment B)
b.	Lettering: (45 characters with spaces in centered 2-line presentation in 28 point Arial font)

2.	Color:  White or light neutral color (not grey).
 

Delivery Schedule:  1.	All deliveries and Final Acceptance of equipment are completed within 60 calendar days of Contact Award, but no later than January 15, 2012.  Refer to 'C. General Requirements' for all pertinent requirements

3)  Delays:  If for any reason the scheduled date for a deliverable cannot be met, the contractor is required to notify the COTR and the designated VHA contact (include the original deliverable due date) in writing, including a firm commitment of when the delivery will be completed.  This notice to the COTR shall cite the reasons for the delay, and the impact on the overall project.  The COTR will then review the facts and issue a response in accordance with the contract and applicable regulations. Any change affecting the overall delivery schedule must be approved by the Contract Officer.

4) Unable to Complete Order by January 15, 2012:  Do to time sensitive funding issues for this acquisition, deliveries /acceptance not completed by January 15, 2012 could be cancelled unilaterally by the Contracting Officer. The Vendor must have written approval from the COTR/Contract Officer for any delivery January 15, 2012.


F. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

As noted in A. 2), the Vendor is responsible for Station delivery inspection.  The A. 2) 'Delivery & Acceptance' also provides the VHA acceptance criteria.  Where deliveries are to locations with receiving docks, VHA will inspect the delivery for obvious damage and report this on the shipping papers.  Facilities with shipping docks are identified in ' Schedule for Deliverables'.


G. CHANGES TO STATEMENT OF WORK

Any changes to this SOW must be authorized and approved only through written correspondence from the Contracting Officer. A copy of each change will be kept in a project folder, along with all other products of the project.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />FA8604-11-R-7984<br />SERVICES and DATA ACQUISITION FOR<br />LIBRARY OPERATIONS, DATA ACQUISITION, and WEB HOSTING SERVICES (LODAWEB)
<p><br />A. PURPOSE: The purpose of this Sources Sought for FA8604-11-R-7984 is to determine if there are sufficient businesses, small or otherwise, available who are capable of performing the LODAWEB effort described herein. ASC/PKESI (Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, OH) is seeking sources to provide a broad range of professional library and web hosting services and expertise including library operation, specialized information research (including research in foreign languages), limited translation activities, web hosting services, and significant data acquisition.</p>
<p>B. BUSINESS SUMMARY: These are firm-fixed-price (FFP), performance based services with an estimated price of $725K per annum. A core requirement consisting of a 1-year base with four 1-year option periods is anticipated (February 2012 through February 2017). Options on an annual basis are anticipated pending funds availability. These are not inherently governmental functions, personal services, or Mission Essential services. Additionally, data acquisition of several thousand items on a cost reimbursement basis at an estimated cost of $1-$4 million per year.</p>
<p>C. DISCLAIMER: Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with their responses. This Synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request. The Government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties, on an as-required basis, for further clarification on information provided. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force to identify capable potential sources. The Government may use the capabilities information gathered from the LODAWEB Sources Sought Synopsis to develop an acquisition strategy. Foreign participation on this contract is not authorized.</p>
<p>D. SMALL BUSINESS (SB) SET-ASIDE: No set aside decision has been made. However, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a SB Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14*, Limitations on Subcontracting. NOTE: If a SB Set-Aside determination is made for LODAWEB services, at least 50 percent of the Firm Fixed Price of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern (i.e. prime SB contractor).<br />* FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996)<br />(a) This clause does not apply to the unrestricted portion of a partial set-aside.<br />(b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the offeror/contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for:<br />(1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>Capability statements and the summary table submitted by large business must discuss the potential for achievement of DoD and Air Force small business goal categories such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBC&amp;U), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), Small Disadvantages Business (SDB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), etc.</p>
<p>E. NAICS and SIZE STANDARD: The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes to establish size standards on an industry-by-industry basis. LODAWEB will utilize NAICS code 518210 , Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services, with a size standard threshold of $25M. Significant library services are required to perform this effort (reference NAICS 51912) however web hosting is extremely critical for LODAWEB therefore, for acquisition purposes NAICS code 518210 and size standard $25M will be utilized for LODAWEB.</p>
<p>F. SERVICE OVERVIEW: The contractor shall provide all personnel and supervision necessary for LODAWEB services in Dayton, Ohio on behalf of select Air Force and government organizations. The contractor is responsible for a collection of over 123,000 volumes of print monographs and journals (including approximately 200 active print subscriptions) and hosting or providing access to hundreds of online sites and databases and thousands of online journals.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;** THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY **This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/RFI, no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is NOT a Request for Quote (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. The government will not reimburse or pay for any information submitted in response to the RFI. Any request for a solicitation will not receive a response. No obligation is created by either the issuance or response to this RFI. The information sought shall be considered Market Research IAW FAR Part 10.001.</p>
<p>Introduction: The purpose of this Government issued Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is to obtain information and comments from interested and potential sources concerning the capability to inspect, repair and overhaul the United States Air Force (USAF) T53-L-703 engine fuel control manufactured by Goodrich Pump &amp;Engine Control System (GPECS) and installed on the Honeywell T53-L-703 engine used to power the TH-1H aircraft. Honeywell identifies the fuel control as P/N 1-170-780-01 and the GPECS designation is 100770A5, NSN 2915-01-459-8654. The fuel control consists of a main regulator and an overspeed governor. The main regulator consists of a compressor rotor speed governor, acceleration and deceleration control, an air bleed signal mechanism, inlet guide vane control signal mechanism, and a fuel shutoff valve. Functionally, the main regulator is divided into a flow control section and a computer section. The flow control section consists of the components that meter engine fuel flow. The computer section comprises elements that schedule the positioning of the metering valve of the flow control section as a function of the input signals to the regulator. The overspeed governor provides the fuel control with an N2 speed signal. Fuel flow is then metered to maintain the desired N2 speed plus or minus 50 rpm. The overspeed governor also serves as an override mechanism to reduce fuel flow in case of a power turbine overspeed. The USAF T53-L-703 engines are currently maintained under a three level maintenance concept comprised of Organizational, Intermediate, and Depot levels. The intent of this SSS is to cover maintenance beyond the capability or scope of the Organizational level for the USAF T53-L-703 fuel control. The objective is for the engine's fuel control to be inspected, repaired and/ or overhauled using OEM Manuals and incorporating Honeywell's service bulletin T53- 0138 / Goodrich Pump &amp; Engine Controls Systems Inc Service Bulletin 73-42 for TA controls .<br />Should the government pursue a contracting action for repair/overhaul of the fuel control, potential candidates/vendors would need to complete a Source Approval Request (SAR) in order to be eligible for the workload/contract award. Contractors must be ISO 9001:2000, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Goodrich Pump &amp; Engine Controls Systems Inc (GPECS) certified to repair the fuel control. The vendor must also comply with all Military specifications on material used in the items repaired. The Air Force is hereby soliciting capability statements from interested sources in support of the T53-L-703 engine fuel control P/N 1-170-780-01.<br />Scope: This RFI is directed to potential contractors who have demonstrated experience in the areas of tear-down, functional testing, evaluation, repair and overhaul of the T53-L-703 engine fuel control. The Government will use the information gathered in response to this SSS/RFI and additional market research to refine the strategy for a potential repair effort. Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks. <br />Information / Format: Potential offerors are requested to provide information on capabilities currently being performed which meet the needs of the Air Force in supporting the T53-L-703 engine, or relevant history and evidence of past performance/capability. The Air Force is expecting that the requirement to provide information on current or past services meeting the needs of the Air Force will demonstrate the offeror has an existing infrastructure and capabilities to support all aspects of this effort. Please include the following information in your response: <br />&bull; Company name and associated CAGE code<br />&bull; Point of contact name and number<br />&bull; Business status: Large, Small, 8(a), HUBZone, Woman-owned, etc<br />&bull; Qualifications/Certifications/Aircraft Experience level of employees</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS: Please submit your responses electronically to Rhonda.croft@tinker.af.mil (hard copies are not necessary). If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance. Please indicate whether or not your response to this RFI can be provided to non-government advisors. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information. Please see below for contact information.</p>
<p>RFI Questions: <br />1. What delivery timeframes/turntimes are typical for fuel controls based on the following :<br />(a) Teardown, Test &amp; Evaluation (TT&amp;E) <br />(b) Mid-life inspection per service bulletin T53-0138 ( Minor Repair)<br />(c) Overhaul (Major Repair)<br />(d) Remanufacture <br />2. What will be the approximate cost to the government for accomplishment of items a, b, c, and d above<br />3. Are there additional levels of inspections not identified above? Please identify and submit cost information.<br />3. What warranty, if any, is typical for the repair of this fuel control? <br />4. Can the warranty be limited to just operational flight hours? <br />5. Is facility FAA certified?<br />6. Is facility ISO 9001 certified?<br />7. Is facility GPECS certified?<br />8. Are you currently providing this service to commercial customers? <br />Please provide any additional relevant feedback that is deemed important in developing this requirement.

Due to the phase transition of the formulation from liquid to frozen, and finally a dry cake structure, it is essential to monitor changes in the system to understand subtle changes that occur during the process. Near-Infrared alone is not suitable for liquid systems, because water bands can interfere with interpretation, therefore Raman is needed as a complimentary tool to monitor the process during the initial phase from liquid to frozen solid. The two techniques will work to complement each other during the remainder of the cycle to monitor moisture content and other important chemical and physical changes.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an automated, high-power, narrow-band, widely-tunable source to use for calibration sources for radiometry, reflectometry, astronomy, scale realization, etc.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is looking to develop a truly hands-off automated calibration source with high power (&gt;100 mW) from 350nm to 2500nm.</p>
<p>The preference would be for cw sources, however, mode-locked systems with repetition rates higher than 50 MHz may be considered. There is also a preference for a spectral bandwidth of less than 1nm, however, broader bandwidths would be considered. Since many of our calibrations occur at remote sites, a compact and portable system is of great importance to us.</p>
<p>At this time, we are looking for sources capable of providing either an entire system which can meet the performance requirements stated herein or a "building block" to such a system (such as an automated laser that will cover a limited wavelength range, but has a direct extension to having full wavelength range we are seeking in the near future, possibly by adding equipment to increase the equipment capabilities).</p>
<p><br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 333314, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice. If two or more small businesses are identified, we will consider a set-aside.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture a system capable of meeting the system performance requirements as stated herein, are requested to email product literature and a letter describing their technological approach in enough detail to determine whether the tunable laser diode system can meet the specifications identified herein to joni.laster@nist.gov no later than the response date for this source sought notice.</p>
<p>The letter shall include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name and size of the company that manufactures the tunable laser diode system for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of the company(s) that are authorized to sell the tunable laser diode system, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number, and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of the number of days after the receipt of the order that is typical for delivery of such tunable laser diode system.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each tunable laser diode system for which specifications are sent to joni.laster@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>All documents must be sent to Joni Laster, contract specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. Email address: joni.laster@nist.gov.</p>
<p>Submission must be received not later than 3:00 pm local time on May 26, 2011</p>

<DESC>"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a need for a project entitled, "Dynamics of Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Research Study." This is a continued need of the Health ABC Study under Contract No. N01-AG-6-2106 (currently being performed by the University of California, San Francisco). The purpose of this study is to characterize the extent of change in body composition in older men and women, identify clinical conditions accelerating these changes, and examine the health impact of these changes on strength, endurance, disability, and weight-related diseases of old age. The study population consists of 3,075 persons age 70-79 at baseline with about equal numbers of men and women. Thirty-three percent of the men are African-Americans as are 46% of the women. All persons in the study were selected to be free of disability in activities of daily living and free of functional limitation (defined as any difficulty walking a quarter of a mile or any difficulty walking up 10 steps without resting) at baseline.</p>
<p>The principal goals of the HEALTH ABC are (1) to assess the association of baseline body weight, lean body mass, body fat, and bone mineral content, in relation to weight history, with incident functional limitation, incidence and change in severity of weight-related health conditions, recovery of physical function after an acute event, baseline measures of strength, fitness and physical performance, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status; (2) to access the contribution of episodes of severe acute illness in healthier older persons to changes in body weight, bone mineral content, lean body mass and body fat, and the relationship of these episodes to risk of functional limitation and recovery; (3) to assess the impact of weight-related co-morbid illness on the risk of functional limitation and recovery; (4) to assess the ways in which physiologic mediators of change in body composition influence and are influenced by changes in health in older adults and contribute to change in body composition; to understand how changes in body composition affect weight-related cardiovascular disease risk factors such as lipids, blood pressure and glucose tolerance; (5) to assess the interdependency of behavioral factors, such as nutrition and physical activity, co-morbid health conditions, and their association with change in body composition in old age; and (6) to provide a firm scientific basis for understanding issues related to weight recommendations in old age through increased knowledge of the potential trade-offs between weight and risk of functional limitation, disability, morbidity and death; to provide information critical for developing effective strategies for the maintenance of health in older persons.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br /><br />The intramural Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography and Biometry (LEDB) has been supporting the clinical research study entitled the Dynamics of Health, Aging and Body Composition (HEALTH ABC) since 1997. This study, targeted to understanding the decline in function of healthier older persons, complements research efforts in prevention of functional decline for healthy and frail older persons by focusing on the substantial majority of older persons in transition from vigor to frailty. <br /><br />The major objectives of the HEALTH ABC Study relate to observations that change in body composition in old age, particularly the increase in body fat and the decline in lean mass and bone mineral, represent a common pathway by which multiple diseases contribute to disability. There are many unanswered questions regarding the patterns and health impact of changes in weight and body composition in old age. Weight generally increases over the lifetime until late middle age, then tends to decrease into old age with changes in muscle, fat and bone. It has been postulated that the accelerated loss of muscle and strength in old age contributes to the onset of disability. Studies of weight and its relationship to mortality in older persons have yielded contradictory findings, leading to controversy regarding public health recommendations for weight in old age. Few studies have examined weight-related morbidity in old age, especially among African-Americans.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The primary study tasks include: A) Support of data collection activities of the Field Centers for 6-month telephone interviews and disease and death outcomes adjudication; B) Data management, maintenance, and distribution of data files for 6-month telephone interviews, disease and death outcomes adjudication, and select other sources of data such an ancillary studies; C) Participation in and administration of the activities of the Diagnosis and Disease Ascertainment Committee; D) Participation in and administration of the publications review process, including the review of analysis proposals and manuscripts; E) Participate in the scientific direction and progress of Health ABC, including administration of the Ancillary Study proposal review process; F) Maintenance of biologic specimen repositories, including genetic material; and G) Information Technology Security Requirements.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: All reports shall be submitted in electronic form as PC-formatted computer files in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and/or searchable PDF format.&nbsp; The following reports will be required: A. Annual Progress Reports, the Contractor shall submit to the COTR and Contracting Officer (CO) a report describing the activities during the reporting period. Each annual progress report shall include a summary of the results of the entire contract work for the period covered and the activities planned for the ensuing reporting period. An annual progress report shall not be required when the final report is due.&nbsp; B. Final Progress Report and Summary of Salient Results, a final report shall be submitted on or before the last day of the period of performance. This report shall include a summation of the work performed and results obtained for the entire contract period of performance. This report shall be in sufficient detail to explain comprehensively the Tasks accomplished and the results achieved, and shall summarize data and statistical analyses performed in text, tabular and graphical form. C. Other Reports and Deliverables: Annual Technical Progress Report for Clinical Research Study Populations. The Contractor shall submit information about the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations for each study being performed under this contract. The Contractor shall submit this information in the format indicated for the Inclusion Enrollment Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is five 12-month performance years from 2/15/2012 through 2/14/2017.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 541712 (500 employees); (2) The Contractor must use the data management system developed for and used for the Health ABC Study. Because the University of California, San Francisco (USCF) is the sole proprietor of this specific version, access to this data management system is limited; and (4) The Contractor must access participants enrolled in the Heatlh ABC Study and provide services to include training study personnel; developing forms, protocols and organizational procedures; ensuring website updates; managing databases, repository subcontracts and the reading center, and overseeing meeting organization. It is essential the Contractor provides optimal performance of services so there will be no discontinuity in work performance and that smooth continuation of the Health ABC Study is maintained.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a "market search" for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement. Information submitted in response to this notice is merely used for internal market research purposes and no feedback will be offered to the interested parties that submit a capability statement.
<p>The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) with support for a modified subchronic inhalation study involving Bacillus anthracis Ames strain spores.</p>
<p>In particular, this study will require a contractor to obtain and prepare at least 120 rabbits for subchronic exposures and monitoring for 45 straight days, and for continued monitoring up to six months following the last exposure dose day. The contractor must be able to prepare and characterize B. anthracis Ames strain spores in accordance with a specific preparation protocol. The contractor shall provide EPA-NHSRC with characterization results including, representative digital images of spores and culture plates, and electronic copies of spore particle size measurements and distributions. All work shall be conducted in certified Bio-Safety Level 3 laboratories. Rabbits shall be placed into a plehtysmography chamber, passed into a Class III cabinet system, and aerosol challenged with targeted inhaled low doses of 10, 50, 100, and 1,000 Colony Forming Units (CFUs) of B. anthracis Ames strain spores. Test conditions and physiological responses shall be monitored in accordance with the specified study design. Measured parameters will include hematology, clinical chemistry, bacteremia, toxemia, and seroconversion. Each animal shall be observed at least twice daily and, if necessary, handled to appraise its physical condition. All animals shall be subjected to a full gross necropsy and histopathology on the respiratory tract, all gross lesions, and other potential target organs.</p>
<p>Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages submitted by respondents are as follows: (1) Capabilities to perform low dose subchronic inhalation rabbit exposure studies using dangerous pathogens; (2) Availability of Bio-Safety Level 3 laboratories for the handling of B. anthracis Ames strain spores; (3) Availability of a large animal exposure system that can generate precise and low aerosol doses.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Completion Type contract with a two year period of performance. The applicable NAICS code is 541712 (research and development in the physical, engineering, and life sciences [except biotechnology] with a size standard of 500 persons. In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small-disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern. As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. Responses to the above should be submitted to growney.matthew@epa.gov no later than 14 calendar days from the date of posting. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP), resulting from this sources sought synopsis.</p>

<DESC><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action. It is posted for information purposes only.
<p>The Parts and Repair Ordering System (PROS) III contract is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations 15.403.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) intends to invoke the Extension of Services clause to extend the current PROS III contract for six (6) months at the rates in effect at the time of the extension. This is a short term effort to bridge the gap between the current contract and the competitive follow-on of the PROS III contract that ends 4 December 2011. The Government plans to award this 6-month extension to the PROS III contract to the incumbent. There is no transition period and the requirement is for full-up support on day one.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) specifically seeking information from industry to be used for the development of specifications and the Statement of Work (SOW) for soil moisture monitoring at select Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program habitat creation and restoration sites.
Responses to this RFI are to be submitted no later than May 31, 2011. All responses to this RFI shall be submitted to Dianne Bangle, at P. O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via email at: DBangle@usbr.gov. Please include Brian Switzer on all emails at BSwitzer@usbr.gov. All questions related to this RFI shall be submitted in writing to the email addresses above and shall include an email address of the requestor. 
This RFI is for project planning purposes only. No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is seeking information from industry to be used for the development of specifications and the Statement of Work (SOW) for soil moisture monitoring at select Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program habitat creation and restoration sites. The need for soil moisture data associated with wildlife species and their surrounding habitat is of primary importance to any habitat creation and restoration program. Likewise, riparian habitat could not exist without sufficient soil moisture needed to support this complex system. 
In order to meet the goals of the MSCP Habitat Conservation Plan, the minimum objectives regarding soil moisture are to define and measure surface water, saturated soils, and moist soils in cottonwood-willow habitat. Additional objectives include, correlating soil moisture data with vegetation data, and evaluating how irrigation water is distributed across each phase.
Interested parties are encouraged to voluntarily provide information in a presentation format on their knowledge and use of soil moisture monitoring instrumentation, examples of sampling plans, and budgetary cost estimates, which will be considered for Reclamation's development of the project specifications and SOW. It is recommended that two overview instrumentation breakdowns/cost estimates be presented; one that meets the minimum objective and one that meets the additional objectives. 
Soil moisture monitoring questions
1.	How long does the soil remain moist (at surface, 3, 12, and 36 inch depths) after irrigation at habitat creation sites? 
2.	What is the volumetric moisture content of the soil at select habitat creation sites?
3.	How effective is the distribution of irrigation water within select phases at habitat creation sites?

Soil moisture monitoring objectives Minimum objective1.	Determine potential habitat for Southwestern willow flycatcher within habitat creation sites by evaluating soil moisture conditions in areas where vegetation meets the performance standards of the species.
Additional objectives2.	Determine rate of infiltration of irrigation water at habitat creation sites.
3.	Determine movement of irrigation water across select habitat creation sites by evaluating soil moisture as an indicator. 
4.	Assess change in soil moisture over time and across soil types and irrigation schedules at habitat creation sites.
Response to RFI should include: 1. Name, address and contact information of party submitting a response to the RFI, 2. Declared interest in presenting information on instrumentation and examples of study designs related to the objectives stated above, 3. Willingness to provide rough cost estimates in the presentation (for budgetary purposes only).
This RFI is issued for information only. Respondents are advised that Reclamation is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. Responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.
If it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

This is a notice of intent to go Sol Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following items:
AutoFish Tagging
Vendor:
Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission205 SE Spokane Street, Suite 100Portland, OR 97202
The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) is an interstate Compact established by Congress in 1947 (Public Law 232, 80th Congress, 61 Stat. 419), and adopted by the State of California (Chapter 1447, 1974).  The purposes of the Compact are to promote the better utilization of fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, and to develop a joint program of protection and prevention of physical waste of such fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the compacting States jointly or separately now have or may have jurisdiction.  PSMFC is governed by one or more representatives from each state, as determined by state statutes, and is supported by annual funds made available by the member states.
One of PSMFC's objectives under the Compact is to facilitate research and management projects relating to interstate fisheries.  This includes providing administrative, fiscal and field coordination and support for interstate and State/Federal research and management projects.  PSMFC has provided this service to the State of California both in the form of administering federal funds to the State of California and state and local funds from the State of California.
Justification to procure fish marking and taggingServices noncompetitively through PSFMC:
The PSMFC marks and tags more than eight million Chinook salmon and steelhead annually at fish hatcheries in California's Central Valley Chinook.  Marking and tagging are accomplished using sophisticated state-of-the-art patented AutoFish tagging systems, which enable processing of larger numbers of fish and with improved precision as compared to the traditional method of conducting the task manually.  PSMFC personnel have specialized technical expertise in the operation of the state-of-the-art AutoFish tagging systems, and no other contractor can provide personnel with the immediate unique technical expertise to operate the Autofish tagging systems.  The Autofish tagging systems available for use in California are shared among all of the State and Federally operated hatcheries in the Central Valley, and are the property of the California Department of Fish and Game.  Because of the unique expertise required to operate the Autofish tagging systems, the California Department of Fish and game require that PSMFC staff be the only contractor permitted to operate the Autofish systems.  Marking/tagging fish using manual techniques is the only alternative to marking/tagging with the automated system, and would result in a significant increase in program cost and decreased precision.  Currently, no steps are being pursued to enable full and open competition for subsequent contracts for fish marking and tagging services at the Service's Coleman and Livingston Stone National Fish Hatchery Complex because of the special circumstances associated with the ownership and operation of the Autofish tagging systems.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>NAVFAC will make a sole source contract award to Professional Analysis, Inc. (PAI) 3703 Mount Airey Lane, Annandale, VA 22003. The action will be a contract modification to existing contract N00178-04-D-4106-EJ01. Task Order EJ01 provides engineering, logistics, and program management support to the Sealift Support Program Office (SSPO). PAI is a small business concern.

The SSPO requires technical services to meet the Fleets' operational readiness requirement and support the Marine Corps Logistic-over-the-shore Capabilities. At a high-level, PAI supports SSPO by ensuring that all the SSPO equipment meets the Fleets Required Operational Capabilities and Potential Operating Environments (ROC/POE) and schedule.

Current efforts must continue while the next competitive procurement, a small-business set-aside, completes the source selection process.
 During this time, service must continue. Retaining the current contractor, PAI, prevents NAVFAC from suffering excessive schedule delays.

<DESC>This is Notice of Intent number HTC711-11-Q-D045. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Rockwell Automation, for an Arena Software license under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This will be in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430 and the small business size is 100 employees.
<p>Rockwell Automation is the only known supplier of Arena software as required by the Agile Transportation for the 21st Century (AT21) program management office. The Arena software is a proprietary product of Rockwell Automation. There are no similar products available through other companies that will satisfy the Government's requirement. Previous Joint Distribution Planning and Analysis Center (JDPAC) simulations have utilized Arena; although the version we currently use is nearly 10 years old. An updated version of Arena would allow us to continue to run the existing models. In addition to the main simulation function, our analysts have utilized Arena's distribution-fitting feature. Staying with the same software package would allow our analysts to continue supporting various studies in a timely manner without the additional time and cost spent to learn new simulation software.<br />Based on the market research, no company other than Rockwell Automation can provide the necessary software products for the requirement. FOB Point is Destination, Scott AFB, IL. Delivery location is TCAQ, 508 Scott Drive, BLDG. 1900W, Scott AFB, IL 62225.</p>

The following FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.204-7(b)(1), By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; DFARS 252-204-7004, Alternate A Central Contractor Registration; 252-212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions or Commercial Items (DEVIATION). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall have posted their FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items at website http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurement. Offers may be e-mailed to Caleb Higgerson at United States Transportation Command, Directorate of Acquisition at caleb.higgerson@ustranscom.mil or faxed to the POC indicated above at 618-220-7909.

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source under statutory 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only one Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Department of Veterans Affairs, Western New York Health Care System, 3495 Bailey Ave., Buffalo NY 14215 requires the replacement of the fire alarm system (Simplex Grinnell) in Building 20 at the Buffalo VA Medical Center.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a special Notice of Intent to award a 6 month extension on HHM402-10-P-0236 to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) for the acquisition of program management services by the Directorate for Information Management, Enterprise Operations Group (DS-OG) at Defense Intelligence Agency, This procurement is contemplated to be a firm fixed price of $117,082.00.
<p>DIA DS-OG has had an individual providing support for the past 4 years under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA). Initial planning was for the requirement to end coincident with the end of the Intelligence Information, Command and Control, Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2 contract) in June 2010. Due to the unplanned and Enterprise (SITE) contract, a bridge contract between the ICE2 and SITE was awarded. Due to the statutory limits extension of the IPA was not possible. DIA DS-OG requires a six month contract to retain this support.</p>
<p>The sole source purchase order is necessary to retain expertise and detailed knowledge of the ICE2 contract. DIA DS-OG had obtained the support through the current IPA in which the individual has provided services. On the basis of the shot time period required (i.e. maximum 6 months), it is in the best interest of the Government to retain the current expertise rather than transition to a new source-thereby requiring training and learning curve.</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />52.252-6, Authorized Deviations in Clauses</p>
<p>(a) The use in this solicitation or contract of any Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the date of the clause.<br />(b) The use in this solicitation or contract of any Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (48 CFR Chapter 2) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the name of the regulation.<br />L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES<br />In accordance with procedures set forth in AFI 31-101_MWSUP 1 Oct 08:<br />1. Normal Installation Entry. Entry to MAFB requires possession and verification of approved identification credentials. Personnel without valid identification will be referred to the Visitor Control Center (VCC) located at the 2nd Avenue North Gate entrance. People who cannot be properly identified or sponsored will be denied entry.<br />2. Contractor Access: Upon award of a contract, the contractor awarded the contract will be issued a request for a Contractor Entry Authority List (CEAL) by the contract administrator. Upon receipt, the contractor must compile the information required for the CEAL and submit a completed CEAL to the contract administrator. Until this occurs, no employees will be permitted to enter Malmstrom AFB. <br />3. The contracting office approves the list and hand carries it to the Pass and Registration Section (341 SFS/S5B) for review. S5B personnel will compare the approving official's signature against a DD Form 577, Signature Card, or an appropriate letter on file at pass and registration. S5B then hand carries the submission to the 911 Dispatch Center.<br />4. A 911 dispatcher certified on the National Criminal Information Center system (NCIC) will run the contractor names through the NCIC for wants and warrants. The 911Dispatch Center will input all listed employees' names and data into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database for a background check in accordance with Air Force directives. Unfavorable results from the background check will result in individuals being denied access to the installation, including, but not limited to, individuals that are determined to fall into one or more of the following categories: those having outstanding wants or warrants, sex offenders, violent offenders, those who are on probation, and those who are in a pre-release program. The definition of sex offender and violent offender can be found at Montana Code Annotated &sect; 46-23-502. After the dispatcher completes the NCIC check, they will sign the letters and return them to S5B. Unfavorable results will be grounds for denial of entry.<br />5. Contractor personnel requesting a contractor pass will provide a picture ID<br />to be verified against the Contractor EAL. Those employees, who clear the background check process, will be issued passes by S5B, located in Building 250, for the duration of the contract or one year, whichever period is shorter. For contracts lasting more than one year, including contract options, renewals and extensions, the contractor must repeat the above stated process on an annual basis. In addition, the process must be initiated for all new employees who are added to the CEAL after its initial submission.<br />6. Contractors are required to notify the contracting officer and S5B if an employee on a CEAL terminates his or her employment with the contractor or is involved in an incident that would result in unfavorable results from the background check including, but not limited to, those identified in paragraph 4 above. If a contractor terminates an employee, it is incumbent upon the contractor to ensure that the employee's access badge is returned to the Pass and Registration office. If they are unable to retrieve the pass, they will contact S5B with the employee's information. S5B will then contact the installation entry control points and have them retrieve the pass if the person attempts to re-enter the base. In the case of a missile field contractor the S5B will contact Keys and Codes Control Center.<br />7. Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are contractor employees must use their contractor's pass when entering Malmstrom AFB for the performance of contract services. Under no circumstance will retired military members or dependents of active duty or retired military members vouch contractor personnel onto the installation utilizing their Armed Forces Identification Card. All DoD contractors who have been issued a Common Access Card will be allowed to sign people onto the installation. <br />8. Violations of the stated entry procedures will be considered a breach of contract and the contracting officer will take appropriate action in accordance with the contract. Repeated or flagrant violations of this policy may result in termination of the contract for default. Contractor/vendor passes are for granting access to the installation for the sole purpose of employment. These passes do not permit access to or usage of government facilities or services (i.e., gym, service station, and dining hall.) However, during contractor/vendor "duty hours," the Burger King, Base Exchange Bowling Alley and Grizzly Bend Club eateries may be utilized.<br />9. Local delivery companies (e.g., food, furniture, appliances) will submit a letter to the 341 SFS Pass and Registration Section containing the name of the company, the driver's name(s), date of birth, driver's license number and vehicle information. All information will be cross-checked against the installation barment and revocation list and the NCIC via the 911 Dispatch Center prior to approval. A copy of the letter will be maintained in the possession of the driver requesting entry. If the driver does not possess a letter, he/she will be directed to the VCC where an AF IMT 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass, will be issued after verification of the delivery has been made through the on-base residence sponsor.<br />10. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to have insurance coverage on the vehicle to meet Montana State minimum requirement.</p>
<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>
<p>*LPO DoDAACs are used for Navy contracts only.</p>

Quote must be emailed to alexander.smith.12@malmstrom.af.mil or faxed to (406) 731-4005 to the attention of Alex Smith.

<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>
<p>*LPO DoDAACs are used for Navy contracts only.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format contained in FAR Subparts 12.6 and 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple firm fixed price purchase orders for the requirement listed below as a small business set-aside.  The Government reserves the right to award single or multiple awards.Solicitation Number W15QKN-11-T-F005 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and must be referenced in all proposals sent in response to this request.  It is the responsibility of any interested parties to periodically check for any amendments to this solicitation.  NAICS code is 332994.  Small business size standard is 500.  The US Army Contracting Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, is soliciting to procure five (5) lightweight barrels for the intended purpose of improving the performance of low rate of fire weapons, such as bolt action sniper rifles.  The Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for this solicitation is CLIN 0001 for a quantity of five (5) each commercially available lightweight barrels.
The requirements are:1)	Readiness Level:  Design is ready to work in its final form and under expected conditions and the manufacturer currently has the required tooling/machinery to fabricate and deliver small sample quantities within 90 days after contract award for Government evaluation.  The manufacturers existing technical data currently provides sufficient data to support fabrication of prototype materiel (Developmental Design Drawings) and production processes are mature enough to reliably fabricate samples for evaluation.  (See MIL-DTL-31000C, section 3.6.1 for Developmental and Product drawing definitions).
2)	Technology/Technical Approach:  Weight reduction that is accomplished solely by removing steel from a barrel (e.g. fluting, tapering) is not considered an alternative to current Army barrel technologies/configurations and does not meet the requirements of this contract.  The barrel hardware shall be composed of materials other than commonly used barrel materials (i.e. stainless or chrome moly).  Applicable technologies/processes include, but are not limited to, carbon fiber wrapped or low density alloy composite barrels and/or new manufacturing methods that enable the use of alternative barrel alloys to reduce weight and maintain or improve barrel stiffness.
3)	Chamber dimensions.  The chamber shall conform to the chamber dimensions and tolerances as specified in ANSI/SAAMI 2299.4 for .300 Winchester Magnum Ammunition.  All chambers must be cut short. Customer will perform final chambering when mated with existing receiver.         4)	Interface:  The chambered end of each barrel shall interface with a Remington 700 Long Action receiver.  Interface specifications shall be provided upon request.

1.3 Cushioning - Items requiring protection from physical and mechanical damage (e.g. fragile, sensitive, critical material) or which could cause physical damage to other items, shall be protected by wrapping, cushioning, pack compartmentalization, or other means to mitigate shock and vibration and prevent damage during handling and shipment. 
2. Unit package 
2.1 Unit Package - A unit package shall be so designed and constructed that it will contain the contents with no damage to the item(s), and with minimal damage to the unit pack during shipment and storage in the shipping container, and will allow subsequent handling.

4.2 Shipping Containers - The shipping container (including any necessary blocking, bracing, cushioning, or waterproofing) shall comply with the regulations of the carrier used and shall provide safe delivery to the destination at the lowest tariff cost. The shipping container shall be capable of multiple handling, stacking at least ten feet high, and storage under favorable conditions (such as enclosed facilities) for a minimum of one year. 
5. Unitization: Shipments of identical items going to the same destination shall be palletized if they have a total cubic displacement of 50 cubic feet or more unless skids or other forklift handling features are included on the containers. Pallet loads must be stable, and to the greatest extent possible, provide a level top for ease of stacking. A palletized load shall be of a size to allow for placement of two loads high and wide in a conveyance. The weight capacity of the pallet must be adequate for the load. The preferred commercial expendable pallet is a 40 x 48 inch, 4-way entry pallet although variations may be permitted as dictated by the characteristics of the items being unitized.

The Technical element of the evaluation will be a determination as to whether the proposed product meets the performance characteristics and specifications in the solicitation.

The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the Government to determine whether the product meets the performance characteristics and specifications of the requirement.

Offerors shall include ____3____ records of sales from the previous __24__ months.  Offerors shall identify a point of contact for each sale by providing a name and telephone number.

Improvised explosives consist of suitable combinations of fuels and oxidizers (either as physical mixtures or incorporated at the molecular level) that can have energetic potential. Tests previously performed have included measurements of the safety, hazards, thermal stability, stability, and explosive performance characteristics of these energetic materials. Safety and hazard characterization of improvised explosives provides crucial information regarding their safe handling and manufacturing. Performance characterization experiments test the explosive in a variety of scenarios to determine its explosive potential and quantify its energy release. Contractors proposing on this solicitation will be required to submit pricing and procedures with their proposal as required in the attached solicitation.
<p>The RFP# LDQ004270 is being issued in accordance with FAR Part 15. This RFP is being conducted as an unrestricted procurement. This solicitation is attached and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Jul Lea Shamy, 72 Seaman Avenue, New York, NY for the services for the study of age-related deficits in cognitive function which compromise the quality of life and are among the most troubling consequences of growing older. A major line of research in the Neurocognitive Aging Section (NAS) of the Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology is aimed at establishing a nonhuman primate model for defining the basis of normal cognitive aging. An important goal of these studies is to develop a detailed and sensitive framework for testing the working hypothesis that age-related decline results from large-scale restructuring of the neural networks that support normal memory. Toward this end, subjects receive periodic high resolution, structural MRI and corresponding [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans, over the course of neuropsychological testing. Metabolic activity in the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe system is then evaluated in relation to individual variability in the cognitive outcome of aging. The imaging data are also subject to Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) analysis, providing a nonbiased, whole-brain mapping of age-related metabolic change. <br />As part of her Ph.D. research, Dr. Jul Lea Shamy conducted several novel in vivo brain imaging studies utilizing our nonhuman primate model of cognitive aging. Key findings included the observation that the volume of the hippocampus is largely preserved under conditions where the confounding influence of neurodegenerative disease can be excluded, even among subjects with documented deficits in hippocampal memory function (Shamy et al., 2006). By comparison, certain signatures of cognitive aging in monkeys appear associated with broader, network scale alterations distributed across multiple memory-related brain regions (Alexander et al., 2008). Ongoing NAS studies require this established expertise in imaging analysis in nonhuman primate models of cognitive aging. In this project Dr. Shamy will perform post-acquisition image processing and analysis of structural MRI images from behaviorally characterized young and aged monkeys. This analysis may include both region-of-interest and voxel-based approaches for identifying brain markers of normal cognitive aging. The MRI scans will also provide anatomical localization for FDG PET data, providing a reflection of potential metabolic change in the aged brain. Dr. Shamy has extensive expertise in image analysis in relation to cognitive aging in the monkey, and her support will be critical to the success of our ongoing studies. Dr. Shamy has conducted this services and published this data in journals including Neurobiology - Aging. <br />Dr. Shamy will conduct project analyses using facilities available to her at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and she will make two trips to the NIA-IRP at the Biomedical Research Center in Baltimore, or the NIH Animal Center in Poolesville, MD for project progress reports and coordination. <br />The anticipated period of performance is May 27 2011 thru May 26, 2012. It is anticipated to be 16 hours per week.<br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI2090665 may be submitted to the NIDA, SS/SA Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, Attention: Idella Simpson or electronically to simpsoi@mail.nih.gov on or before May 26, 2011 at 12 PM.<br />

<p>Description of the ENAS and the ENAS real-time rate computational requirements</p>
<p>ENAS - A SUBSYSTEM OF THE LRSSS<br />The ENAS is one of the two backscatter measuring sub-systems of the Klein 7180 Long-Range Side Scan Sonar (LRSSS). The LRSSS was designed and developed to increase the productivity of backscatter surveys in support of fisheries research. Productivity is judged on survey coverage rate, which is the product of survey speed and usable cross-track range. The LRSSS was designed for a nominal survey speed of 6 knots with a maximum speed of 12 knots. The LRSSS was designed to provide continuous, equivalent, radiometric and quantitative backscatter information across the full swath from port to starboard, a distance of 1 kilometer. The full swath coverage requires two acoustic sub-systems. Equivalent backscatter over the swath was addressed by having both acoustic sub-systems operate in a "narrow" band around 180 kHz. <br />The two acoustic backscatter measurement sub-systems in the LRSSS are: (1) multibeam side scan sonar (MBSS) and (2) extended nadir augmentation sonar (ENAS), where the second is the collective grouping of three separate near-nadir (gap-filling) multi-beam sonars and one vertical beam echo sounder. In order to meet the high signal-to-noise required for long range side scan sonar, the MBSS employs a "long" frequency swept transmission (chirp). In order to reduce the negative impact of cross-talk between the several LRSSS acoustic sub-systems, both frequency-division multiplexing and time-division multiplexing are employed in the transmission of acoustic energy.<br />ENAS BACKGROUND:<br />The purpose of the ENAS is determine the Backscatter Angular Response Function (BARF) of the local seabed along the LRSSS survey track line and contribute to the Cascade Calibration schema for the LRSSS. The ENAS transducers consist of two ELAC-LSE324 and three ELAC-LSE325.<br />The mounting geometry of the two ELAC-LSE324 transducers is a Mills Cross configuration, pointing downward. The mounting geometry for each of the three ELAC-LSE325 transducers is unique. One ELAC-LSE325 transducer is mounted on the tow fish with its MRA pointing 50 degrees from horizontal to the port side. One ELAC-LSE325 transducer is mounted on the tow fish with its MRA pointing 50 degrees from horizontal to the starboard. The third ELAC-LSE325 transducer is mounted on the tow fish with its MRA pointing down toward nadir. <br />Two of the 62 elements in an ELAC-LSE325 transducer are transmit elements. Their function is to convert electrical energy to acoustic energy (NOTE: Only one is active on any given ping). Sixty of the 62 elements in an ELAC-LSE325 transducer are used as receive elements (converting acoustic pressure into electrical voltage). In general, the ENAS receive function includes beam forming, either computational or mechanical (FFT or Mills Cross). To facilitate radiometric adjustment of the ENAS measurements of BARF, each transmit element will be characterized in terms of source level (TVR) and beam width. To facilitate radiometric adjustment of the ENAS measurements of BARF, each receive element will be characterized in terms of beam width and OCVR (transform from acoustic pressure to electrical voltage). The several TVG operators in the system, which act on the gain functions of any ENAS receive element, will also be characterized in terms of fixed gain and time-varying gain. <br />One element in the Mills Cross configuration of two ELAC-LSE324 arrays will transmit a short (0.333 ms) CW-pulse at 180 kHz. The output from the receive element of the Mills Cross configuration of two ELAC-LSE325 arrays will be recorded at a complex sample rate of 12 kHz onto the LRSSS RAID (data storage array). It is also important to recognize that the nadir pointing Mills Cross Array primarily receives bottom echoes resulting from the acoustic energy propagating from the Mills Cross Array transmitter.<br />One transmit element in each of the three ELAC-LSE325 transducers will emit simultaneous 8 msec chirps with 6 kHz bandwidth. The nominal acoustic frequency for the two ELAC-LSE325 transducers, whose MRA point either toward port or toward starboard, will be 177 kHz. It is important to recognize due to the coordinated time multiplexed nature of transmissions by the ENAS and the MBSS, the port and starboard pointing ENAS-transducers arrays are primarily receiving bottom echoes resulting from either acoustic energy propagating from the transmitter in each of those "177 kHz" arrays, or acoustic energy propagating from the transmitter in each of the MBSS arrays. The nominal acoustic frequency for the one ELAC-LSE325 transducer, whose MRA points toward nadir, will be 183 kHz. It is important to recognize that the Nadir facing ENAS primarily receives bottom echoes resulting from acoustic energy propagating from the transmitter in the "183 kHz" array. The acoustic energy received on the three ELAC-LSE325 transducers will be digitally sampled and recorded at a complex sample rate of 12 kHz onto the LRSSS RAID. <br />The ENAS recorded raw data format will be an extension of the Fishpac SDF2 format. It will contain the sampled signals from each receive stave, as well as the ping time, sound speed measured at the tow fish, depth of the tow fish, altitude of the tow fish, attitude of the tow fish, ship position and tow fish position. The ENAS processed data will be recorded in an extension of the Klein SFX format. Those records will contain beam slant range travel times from the tow fish to the seabed, beam angles relative to local vertical, backscatter amplitudes after radiometric adjustments, and a data quality parameter representing at least 4 states of 4 different factors (co-linearity of cross track bathy solutions and associated backscatter amplitudes, signal-to-noise of backscatter amplitude, and dispersion of bathy phase solution) <br />ENAS BEAM FORMING:<br />The beam forming and subsequent extraction of information necessary to develop the BARF will operate on recorded data files after they have been closed (subsequent to being written to the LRSSS RAID). The ENAS will produce 204 independent bottom detections per ping that are reported as one-way travel time to the bottom and angle relative to local vertical from the tow fish to the location of the bottom detection. The ENAS will produce 204 independent BARF backscatter measurements that are reported as "flat bottom" radiometric adjusted amplitudes at the time of the bottom detection. The ENAS will produce 204 independent estimates of the quality of the bottom detection. The number of "204" is based on there being one ENAS array (ELAC-LSE325 transducers) providing BARF information on 91 beams, two ENAS arrays (ELAC-LSE325 transducers) which each provide BARF information on 56 beams and one ENAS array (Mills Cross of two ELAC-LSE234 transducers) providing BARF information on 1 beam.<br />The first processing step for each ping of ENAS raw data from the LRSSS RAID will be to leading edge detect the receive signals from the Mills Cross ENAS to establish the altitude of the tow fish above the seabed, as well as, determine the radiometric adjusted backscatter amplitude of the returning echo for recording onto the LRSSS RAID (in SDF2 format). There is no computational beam forming to be performed because the beam forming is inherent to the Mills Cross configuration. The radiometric adjustments to the backscatter amplitude are to be based on the transmit source level, receive sensitivity, transmit beam pattern, receive beam pattern, footprint size at the time of the amplitude determination and gain (both fixed and time-varying).<br />The information bearing signals that are received on the three ELAC-LSE325 transducers result from echoes of a swept-frequency transmission (linear chirp); therefore beam forming starts with pulse compression using a replica of the respective transmit chirp waveform. It is expected that the beam forming for the three ELAC-LSE325 transducers will be accomplished using "zero-padded" FFTs across the 60 receive elements of the those transducers, followed by interpolation, and/or across multiple sub-arrays comprised of less than 60-elements, followed by interpolation. <br />BOTTOM DETECTION:<br />The technique for making the required detection of the bottom and subsequent determination of the backscatter amplitude for any given beam depends on the length of the echo return (number of samples in the "elevated" echo return) in a particular beam, which in turn is determined by the angle at which acoustic energy associated with the particular beam intersected with the local seabed. In those instances where there are two recommended bottom detection techniques, the reported value should be the average of the two solutions. Transitions from one bottom solution to two bottom solutions, or vice versa, should use a tapered 3-element weighted average of the two bottom solutions. <br />When the beam projection is within 17 degrees from perpendicular to the nominal seabed, the bottom detection should be performed by detecting the "leading edge" of the most significant increase of the received signals in each of the specific beams. In this approach, the determination of backscatter pulse amplitude for each beam is made starting at the time of the bottom detection for that beam. The radiometric adjustments to the backscatter amplitudes are to be based on the ENAS transmit source level, ENAS receive sensitivity, transmit beam pattern, receive beam pattern, footprint size at the time of the bottom determination, and gain (both fixed and time-varying).<br />When the beam projection is greater than 13 degrees, but less than 49 degrees, from perpendicular to the nominal seabed, the bottom detection should be performed via a weighted mean time of arrival technique (WMT) (deMoustier, 1993). Travel times are estimated using the sound speed that is observed at the tow fish. In this approach, the backscatter amplitude determination for each beam is made at the time of the bottom detection for that beam. The radiometric adjustments to the backscatter amplitudes are to be based on the ENAS transmit source level, ENAS receive sensitivity, transmit beam pattern, receive beam pattern, footprint size at the time of the bottom determination, and gain (both fixed and time-varying).<br />When the beam projection to the seabed is greater than 41 degrees from perpendicular to the nominal seabed, the bottom detections and subsequent determinations of backscatter amplitudes should be made via the "phase" technique which uses phase difference between overlapping beams formed via FFTs performed on multiple sub-arrays. The "phase" technique is regularly employed when the bottom returns are greatly elongated due to the geometry of beams at large off-nadir angles. The phase technique equates the time of the bottom detection to the time of zero phase difference between spatially overlapping beams. In the phase technique: (Hammerstad et. al., 1991) the "time" of bottom detection is determined by fitting a curve to the trend in the differential phase time series between two spatially overlapping beams. Depending on the coherence of the phase data, the bandwidth of the received signal may need to be limited in order to achieve a reasonably robust estimate of the time of the zero-phase crossing epochs. (Kraft and de Moustier, 2004) In this approach, the backscatter amplitude determination for each beam is made at the time of the bottom detection for that beam. The radiometric adjustments to the backscatter amplitudes are to be based on the ENAS transmit source level, ENAS receive sensitivity, transmit beam pattern, receive beam pattern, and footprint size at the time of the bottom determination, and gain (both fixed and time-varying).<br />Computations (Beaudoin, et. al., 2004) to determine the WGS84 geo-locations of the bottom detections and the backscatter determinations must utilize the tow body attitude and locations from the raw data SDF2 files on the system RAID.<br />ENAS CONTRIBUTIONS TO LRSSS CASCADING CALIBRATION<br />ENAS backscatter is an integral part of the LRSSS Cascading Calibration. The two large 3-m side scan arrays on the LRSSS tow body are difficult to calibrate, even when each is disassembled into its three 1-m component (ELAC-LSE327) transducers. This presents a problem, considering that backscatter measurements from all of the LRSSS subsystems are intended to be quantitative and equivalent rather than simply providing qualitative information. The two ELAC-LSE324 transducers which comprise the nadir pointing Mills Cross Array are simple two terminal devices, which can readily be removed from the LRSSS tow body and be subjected to classical tank calibration techniques. Spatial discrimination of the effective backscatter measurement area on the sea bed is provided by the Mills Cross orthogonal mechanical mounting orientations of the two ELAC-LSE324 transducers. Backscatter measurements from a nadir pointing Mills Cross transducer are reliable and robust. The backscatter values from a nadir pointing Mills Cross transducer are easy to analyze for the relative backscatter in dB per square meter, provided that the fixed and range (time) varying gain properties of the receive channel are well known. Accurate and precise backscatter values can be computed for the observed nadir aspect of BARF, which are based on tank measurements of: (1) the 2-D beam patterns for the ELAC-LSE324 transducers, (2) the TVR for the ELAC-LSE324 transducers, (3) the OCVR for the ELAC-LSE324 transducers, and (4) transmitted pulse length. <br />The physical mounting arrangement of the ENAS transducers on the LRSSS tow body results in spatial overlap of the areas on the sea bed where BARF can be individually measured by different ENAS transducers. The downward pointing Mills Cross Array, composed of two ELAC-LSE324 transducers, provides information on BARF at nadir. After beam forming is performed on signals received on the nadir pointing ELAC-LSE 325 transducer, an independent measurement of BARF at nadir is obtained. Comparisons between the two independent measurements of BARF at nadir provides information that can be used to "force" the BARF value at nadir from the ELAC-LSE325 transducer into correspondence with the BARF value at nadir from the Mills Cross Array composed of two ELAC-LSE324 transducers. As the de facto system standard, the "superior knowledge" of the ELAC-LSE324 characteristics justifies the backscatter from other transducers in the cascading calibration process being forced to "statistically" agree with the data obtained with the ELAC-LSE324. The comparison statistics will be the mean and standard deviation in the linear domain and the median in the dB domain.<br />The calibration cascade continues with comparisons between backscatter measurements resulting from electronic beam forming applied to the receive signals on the nadir, port and starboard pointing ELAC-LSE325 transducers. Common angles in the BARF may be associated with beams that are steered differently relative to an array's face- normal, therefore the beam footprints may not coincide. Nevertheless, with appropriate adjustments for the differing beam widths, the BARF measurements from the off-nadir beams of the downward facing ELAC-LSE325 transducer can be used to force "statistical" agreement between itself and the BARF measurements from the port and starboard pointing ELAC-LSE325 transducers. The forcing will be based on comparisons between the mean and standard deviation in the linear domain and the median in the dB domain.<br />EXTENSION OF LRSSS CALIBRATION CASCADE<br />The ENAS processing does not extend to the Multi-Beam Side Scan (MBSS) subsystem of the LRSSS, however, the LRSSS Calibration Cascade does extend to the MBSS. This section is for completeness only. <br />Although it is beyond the scope of ENAS processing, the LRSSS Calibration Cascade continues by forcing agreement between backscatter measurements from the port and starboard pointing ELAC-LSE327 transducers of the MBSS and from the port and starboard pointing ELAC-LSE325 transducers of the ENAS. There are differences in sizes and shapes of the ENAS footprints compared to the sizes and shapes of the MBSS footprints, but those differences are known and can be overcome to force the MBSS measurements of BARF to "statistically" agree with spatially overlapping sections of BARF measurements from the port and starboard ENAS arrays. The comparison statistics will be the mean and standard deviation in the linear domain and the median in the dB domain.<br />At slant ranges beyond reach of the port and starboard pointing ENAS arrays, the MBSS will also carry the cascading calibration imprint of the nadir pointing Mills Cross array, the nadir facing ENAS array and the port and starboard pointing ENAS arrays.<br />It is important to recognize due to the coordinated time multiplexed nature of transmissions by the ENAS and the MBSS, the port and starboard pointing ENAS transducers arrays are primarily receiving bottom echoes resulting from either acoustic energy propagating from the transmitter in each of those arrays, or acoustic energy propagating from the transmitter in each of the MBSS arrays. <br />COMPUTATIONAL LOAD<br />The ENAS computations are always performed on post-recorded data. However, based on the LRSSS at-sea operational practices, the ENAS computational requirements must be performed at a real-time rate on 181 acoustic data channels, at ping intervals of one-second, with a sample rate of 12 kHz, and a sample length of 8000.<br />The computational requirements include:<br />(1) Poll the RAID to determine which, if any, raw data files are closed and ready for ENAS processing.<br />(2) Read raw data from Klein-SDF2 files on the system RAID. <br />(3) Perform bottom detection, amplitude determination and WGS84 geo-location for the data from the single receive element in the ENAS Mills Cross.<br />(4) Perform pulse compression on the 180 ENAS data channels (60 each in three separate transducers) where the information bearing echoes are expected to be swept frequency signals.<br />(5) Form 203 beams (91+56+56) using FFT's across the ENAS multi-element arrays (nadir pointing, port pointing and starboard pointing, respectively).<br />(6) Perform bottom detection, amplitude determinations, quality parameters, and WGS84 geo-location for the 203 beams formed in 5<br />(7) Perform radiometric adjustments to the amplitude determinations in 3 and 6.<br />(8) Determine the calibration cascade factors using information from 3, 6, and 7.<br />(9) Write the results as processed Klein-SDFX files to the system RAID.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. Solicitation AG-6633-S-11-0006 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP's). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), North Dakota State Office intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) to small business sources capable of providing abstract, title commitment and filing services for conservation easements. A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs. It is not a contract. The Government is not obligated to place any call orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders. For each work assignment, the Government will request title services through the issuance of a BPA call order from those firms that have been awarded BPA's. Individual call orders shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPA. Government personnel authorized to place call orders under the BPA will be identified on the BPA by name and telephone number. The contractor will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the Statement of Work that accompanies the order.</p>
<p>Updating and/or developing abstracts, issuing title commitment and filing of easement documents will be for conservation easements located throughout the State of North Dakota. The contractor shall furnish all services, including obtaining title insurance from a title company approved by the U.S. Attorney General. The contractor will perform the same services as a commercial transaction, including updating of existing abstracts, creating abstracts (as deemed necessary), preparing preliminary and final title commitments, obtaining deeds and completion of any necessary curative instruments to assure merchantable title to the conservation easement. The Statement of Work is attached to this solicitation. Timely delivery of complete and accurate abstract and title commitments is crucial to the success of NRCS programs. Call order completion dates will vary depending on the phase of services provided. Obtaining abstracts from landowners may take additional time which in turn will affect completion of the updates and issuance of the preliminary title policy. However, the preliminary title policy will be due within 12 business days of abstract updates being finished. Final title policies shall be completed within 10 business days of contractor receipt of a NRCS Office of General Counsel Preliminary Title Opinion. Photocopies requested by NRCS based on title policy exceptions shall be provided to NRCS within 7 calendar days of NRCS request. Filed/recorded documents shall be returned to NRCS within 5 business days of contractor receipt from the County Recorder's office. Timeframes may fluctuate and therefore will be negotiated with the Contracting Officer as deemed necessary.</p>
<p>This is a Total Small Business Set Aside. The applicable NAICS Code is 541191, with a business size standard of $7M.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Abstract and Title Services are being sought for a period of five (5) years with a BPA period anticipated to be June 25, 2011 to June 24, 2016. The BPA will remain in effect until cancelled by either party.</p>
<p>STANDARDS AND RESPONSIBILITIES: Title Commitment services must comply with the Department of Justice (DOJ) Title Standards 2001.</p>

<p>The provisions of FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Offerors must submit a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer. In addition, the provisions of FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial items apply to this solicitation and are attached.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. <br />EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Capability:<br />Your technical capabilities, as demonstrated in the written technical quotation, will be evaluated to determine your understanding and proven ability to provide the storage units as specified, maintain adequate stock and meet customer demands. In addition to technical capabilities, please provide an estimate on turnaround time for shipping containers to the addresses listed in Section 7.2 of the Statement of Work. The Government will evaluate which offeror represents the greatest potential to provide the most timely, efficient and reliable recycling containers and services for TSA.</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Criterion:<br />The following factor will be considered in evaluating the Offeror's past performance: Demonstrated record (as confirmed by references) of successful past performance of the same or similar projects of this scope on time within budget.<br />Provide past performance references for same or similar current effort as being solicited herein. Please include company/agency name, period of performance, point of contact, telephone and e-mail address. The Offeror shall provide two (2) separate (not from the same company/contracting officer) references with a brief description of previous projects and similar size and complexity. "Similar size and complexity" for the purpose of the evaluation means: similar in dollar amount; number of client/customer employees serviced and number of employees supervised. The TSA may contact those references during the evaluation process to verify relevant experience and level of performance. Even though this will be a no cost contract, you should also provide the dollar amount for the referenced projects. The Government may, at its discretion, obtain and evaluate information from sources other than those provided by the Contractor. <br />Each example of past performance shall include:</p>
<p>a) Contract Number<br />b) Contract Description<br />c) Contract Amount and Type of Contract<br />d) Period of Performance<br />e) Name, address, E-mail address (if available) and telephone number and FAX number of the customer (if a Government contract, please provide the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer and the COR. If commercial, provide the technical and contracting equivalent).<br />f) Size and complexity of the project.<br />g) Whether all options were exercised, if applicable.</p>
<p>Pricing Evaluation Criteria:<br />Because this contract and the resulting delivery orders will be of no cost to the Government, pricing is not a factor in the Government's evaluation.</p>
<p>Selection:<br />Technical and past performance, when combined are equal in importance. Price is not applicable.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />Offerors are requested to demonstrate their expertise through a written proposal. The written response to this RFP may be done in one (1) volume. The submission must not exceed 8 pages and must provide your firm's capability statement and past performance references to provide for TSA wide deployment and collection of the containers as stated above.</p>

<p>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition <br />Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAR 3006.3, HSAM 3006.3, CGAP 1206.3, and in accordance with (IAW) requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.302-1 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p>1) Agency and Contracting Activity: <br />The US Coast Guard, Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), proposes to purchase equipment on a basis other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved: <br />Procurement of brand specific and model specific equipment enclosure for Vessel Traffic Service Sault Ste. Marie, MI.</p>
<p>3) Description of Supplies: <br />The proposed acquisition consists of the following: <br />-EIC Model #S442428-K1H-TS-E1683 Air Conditioned Enclosure, 44" high X 24" wide X 28" deep, NEMA 4X (outdoor use) configuration, welded stainless steel construction (Type 304, unpainted)</p>
<p>-EIC Model #AAC-145-4XT-E-HC-M800 Modified Thermoelectric Solid State Air Conditioner with 1500 BTU/HR rating, NEMA 4X (indoor/outdoor use) configuration, 120VAC power</p>
<p>4) Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." <br />Section (ii) "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-<br />(AA) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition..." is directly applicable.</p>
<p>5) Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: <br />EIC Solutions enclosures utilizing thermoelectric solid state air conditioners are an essential part of Vessel Traffic Service Sault Ste Marie, MI, housing the electronics suites that support remote sensors used to ensure the safety of maritime traffic between Lake Superior, along the St. Mary's River, into Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. These enclosures are located at remote locations on the waterway that are inaccessible large portions of the year. EIC is the only company that manufactures a thermoelectric solid state air conditioner suitable for outdoor shelter use. The thermoelectric solid state air conditioner does not circulate the exterior air so outside contaminants do not enter the shelter. There are no filters to change, compressor parts, Freon gasses, or any of the items traditional air conditioners use that need to be monitored and maintained, making EIC Solutions enclosures with thermoelectric solid state air conditioners ideal for this application.</p>
<p>6) Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable: <br />EIC Solutions are available from several sources of supply. This procurement will be advertised on FEDBIZOPS.</p>
<p>7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: <br />Fairness of price is based on past purchases of similar equipment.</p>
<p>8) Description of Market Research:<br />EIC Solutions holds multiple patents on their thermoelectric solid state air conditioner. This equipment would be replaced only when it is no longer available, does not meet new VTS requirements, or cost increases substantially.<br /><br />9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: <br />N/A</p>
<p>10) A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Writing, An Interest in the Acquisition:<br />EIC Solutions. <br /><br />11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required: <br />N/A</p>
<p>12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. The anticipated cost to the Government is determined to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>James A. Lassiterz<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<p>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition<br />Under 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)<br />Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy<br />Agency Requirements</p>
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), LRS Contract Section, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, proposes to issue a purchase order on a basis other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>Approval is requested for a sole-source, requirements contract, for the repair of the Engine Instrument Display System (EIDS) components used on the HC-130H aircraft.</p>
<p>This system is manufactured by Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) of Exton, PA. The initial purchase was procured using full and open competition. A prototype was developed and then tested and approved by USCG Engineering. Subsequent approval of the prototype allowed installation of this system on all HC-130H aircraft. This requirement is to establish a repair contact for the Engine Data Concentrator Unit P/N: 9B-84052-4, 10 inch Flat panel Display P/N: 9D-84051-7, and the Display Control Panel P/N: 9B-05284-3.</p>
<p>The proposed contract type is a firm-fixed price requirements contract and the vendor is Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) of 720 Pennsylvania Drive, Exton, PA 19341.</p>
<p>(3) Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>As the Aviation Inventory Control Point (AICP), ALC must provide effective supply support for all Coast Guard aviation units and for the Programmed Depot Maintenance Program. Overhauls and repairs are part of this requirement. This requirement is for the repair for the EIDS components. Repairs could be provided for by individual purchase order, but to reduce the administrative burden and increase the repair turn around time, a five year firm-fixed price contract would be more advantages to the Government. This requirement is to be awarded to the OEM. The repair services and estimated quantities are based on current and future material requirements.</p>
<p>Period <br />Base Year 12 mo. $43,883.00<br />Option Year 1 12 mo. $45,638.32<br />Option Year 2 12 mo. $47,463.85<br />Option year 3 12 mo. $49,362.41<br />Option Year4 12 mo. $51,336.90<br />Total: $237,684.48</p>
<p>(4) Identification of the justification and rationale.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only one responsible source or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition require use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>This system is manufactured by Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) of Exton, PA. The initial purchase was procured using full and open competition and the price was determined fair and reasonable. A prototype was developed, tested, and approved by USCG Engineering. Subsequent approval of the prototype allowed installation of this system on all HC-130H aircraft. This requirement is to establish a repair contact for the Engine Data Concentrator Unit P/N: 9B-84052-4, 10 inch Flat panel Display P/N: 9D-84051-7, and the Display Control Panel P/N: 9B-05284-3.</p>
<p>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. IS&amp;S holds the proprietary rights for the technical data and drawing required to effect repairs to this material. No other vendor is authorized by IS&amp;S to effect repairs to this material. The USCG does not have the required data or drawings to overcome the sole source barrier to competition. It would not be cost effective to acquire the data to satisfy full and open competition.</p>
<p>"Only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.2, a Sources Sought Notice was posted on FedBizOps on November 17, 2010 for a fifteen day period.</p>
<p>A web search was conducted using ILS Mart which is a web based parts locator service used by ALC to identify industry venders, both for new buys and repair sources. A complete search using ILS Mart identified no repair sources were available for this material.</p>
<p>A General web search was conducted using the internet. The part numbers and NSNs along with the item descriptions were searched. No information was available for this material using a general web based search.</p>
<p>(7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>It is the Contracting Officer's opinion that price ultimately negotiated for this procurement will be determined fair and reasonable based on comparison with historical AMMIS pricing and pricing identified in FEDLOG.</p>
<p>(8) Description of the market research.</p>
<p>When conducting market research, the Coast Guard's Aviation Maintenance Management Information System (AMMIS) is checked. This is a database that provides historical data for all parts purchased by ALC. This database includes, but is not limited to, part number, nomenclature, purchase/delivery order number and historical pricing data. As part of the requirements package, a copy of all AMMIS data is included to support the independent Government estimate. Federal Logistics (FEDLOG) is a federally supported program which lists all manufacturers/suppliers by cage code. This program provides a valuable tool for supplier information and is utilized by requirements personnel to determine if alternate sources of supply exist. Information is accessed by National Stock Number, Nomenclature, item name, supplier name, and cage code. In this case no repair sources were identified. ILS Mart is a website used to locate hard to find parts and repair venders capable of repairing industry components. No sources were identified using ILS Mart. A Source Sought Notice was posted on FedBizOps seeking repair source for this material. Only the OEM responded to this posting.</p>
<p>Market surveys are continually conducted to identify new sources of supply for the HC-130H components and spare parts. If there are any changes to the market research during this contract period that will benefit the government, than appropriate steps will be taken to recomplete this effort.</p>
<p>Based on the market research performed, only one source and one source only are capable of fulfilling this requirement. The OEM has stated that they are the only authorized source for repair due to proprietary technical data rights. No other source can satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.<br /><br />This requirement is for the repair of proprietary components of the engine instrument display system. Initially on 9/29/06, the USCG issued an unrestricted combined synopsis/solicitation for a prototype Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU) and the production quantities required to outfit the HC-130H aircraft against HSCG38-06-D-500111. The solicitation was posted for 30 days including questions and answers and a response extension. Ample opportunity was given for vendors to submit a proposal that met the USCG's requirement. There were five vendors that responded. The vendor chosen was MTC, now BAE. BAE provided all materials required to satisfy the installation of the FDAU which included the installation of the secondary engine instrument display system manufactured by IS&amp;S.</p>
<p>IS&amp;S is the only manufacture of the EIDS installed on the HC-130H aircraft. The system contains proprietary software that IS&amp;S has developed specifically for the EIDS. IS&amp;S has provided a statement indicating that their system, the technical data, and their drawings are proprietary. They have indicated that no authorization has been given to any other vender to repair this material.</p>
<p>The cost for the government to perform the required steps necessary to reengineer the software, establish the technical data and drawing package and/or to procure this data from IS&amp;S would be extensive in order to overcome the sole source barrier.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.102 and 5.201, a sources sought notice was posted on FedBizOps seeking repair sources on November 17, 2010. The only written response was from the OEM, Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) of 720 Pennsylvania Drive, Exton, PA 19341. They indicated there repair capabilities and that they are the only authorized repair source for this material.</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions.</p>
<p>The USCG does not have the required data or drawings to overcome the sole source barrier to competition.</p>
<p>As the Aircraft Inventory Control Point (AICP), ALC is tasked with supporting systems that have been deployed for use in the aviation community. However, in an effort to increase competition among affiliates and distributors, LRS Product Line members annually attend aviation trade shows, extensive Internet database research is conducted and procurements are advertised in FedBizOpps. In support of the Competition in Contracting Act, ALC established the New Product Development Branch (NPD). The NPD representative assigned to the LRS Product Line has the responsibility to locate new sources of supply/services and alternate acceptable products</p>
<p>New Product Development representative with Engineering and contracting continuously conduct market research through sources sought notices, posting RFQs and RFPs in FedBizOpps, attendance of trade shows and networking to ensure that companies interested in doing business with the USCG are given every opportunity to compete for our requirements.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (CG-9131)<br />United States Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3695<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904<br /><br /><br />Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date.

Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above.

The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal.
 All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.
 ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.
 The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items applies to this solicitation. The following addenda have been attached to this provision:</p>
<p>Addendum Paragraph (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm until September 30, 2011.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows:</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the items/services offered to meet or exceed the Government's requirement.<br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price in determining the best value to the government; however price remains a significant factor and must be affordable.</p>
<p>The proposals will be analyzed to ensure the fulfillment of the minimum technical specifications as specified above. Proposals considered not to meet the minimum specifications may be excluded from further consideration. The specifications described above should be fulfilled, and all information requested should be provided in order to allow for an appropriate determination of best value. Offeror shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered instrument and components meet the technical requirements identified above.</p>
<p>Technical capability will be determined by review of information submitted by the offeror which must provide a description in sufficient detail to show that the product and service offered meets the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal however the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government To ensure information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the product and/or service meets the technical requirements. Offerors shall specifically address the specifications stated above as well as technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information which demonstrates the capabilities of the offeror. Offerors must provide quote along with completing the price in the schedule of items above. Prices shall include all costs associated to include delivery and import duty fees if applicable. Include the firms DUNS number on quote. Prices shall include all costs associated to include delivery and import duty fees if applicable. As technical capability of the instrument becomes essentially equal price may become the ultimate determining factor.</p>
<p>Offerors will be sent identical specimens: a grid of carbon film and a solution of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) (or a similar standard provided by the Government). Carbon film will be imaged by the manufacturers with a 4k camera at or near 80,000x microscope magnification and a through-focus-series collected from -0.5 to -3.0 &mu;m defocus in 0.5 &mu;m increments at dosages no more than 300 electrons per square nm total dose. Thon rings will be evaluated to determine performance at room temperature. The second specimen will be prepared by the manufacturer for cryoEM. Images of TMV in vitrified ice will be collected and layer lines examined to determine performance under low temperature low dose (cryoEM) conditions. Raw images and any analysis performed by the manufactures will be sent to the Government. The time allowed for this analysis by the offeror will be thirty (30) calendar days.</p>
<p>In the event that a TEM and 4k camera combination as outlined in the solicitation can not be provided for evaluation, offerors may image on film and have that film digitized with a pixel size comparable to or smaller than what would be obtained with a 4k bottom mounted CCD at the requested magnification. This requirement is for the evaluation of the performance of the TEM not the CCD. Since the Government is interested in the specific performance of the TEM, any data provided by the manufacturer that is limited and prevents full evaluation of the system at the requested magnification may detract from the evaluation of the offeror. The offeror should explicitly explain the system and camera used.<br /><br />Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of the proposed products to industry or government agencies. Past performance will consider the ability of the items to meet technical specifications as advertised by the offeror, past record of meeting delivery schedules, meeting performance specs and service/maintenance reputation. Offerors must include at least three recent contracts within the last 3 years that have purchased the same equipment as currently offered, and identify company name, point of contact name, telephone number and email address for each contract. This includes the TEM and camera.<br /><br />In the event that the offeror does not have past performance for the same TEM and camera as quoted by the offeror, the offeror may substitute past performance for the camera with past performance of the same brand camera system as quoted. The camera does not have to be exact model; however, since the Government is interested in the specific performance of equipment outlined in the specifications, only being able to demonstrate past performance of similar system may detract from the evaluation of offeror.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.</p>
<p>The Provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (MAR 2011), applies to this acquisition. An offeror should complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

General Information</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting other Government personnel in regard to this solicitation prior to award. Prospective Offerors are also cautioned to advise potential subcontractors or teaming contractors of this instruction. If such contact occurs and is found too prejudicial to competing Offerors, the Offeror (including subcontractors or teaming partners) making such contact may be excluded from award consideration. Only responses from the Contracting Officer in writing shall be considered for purposes of this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will use the data and information gathered in the course of this pilot to determine the feasibility of SaaS, Computing to Go Service Models, and Public/Private Cloud Computing for NGA. If this proof of concept is successful, NGA intends to procure these services agency-wide through a competitive acquisition. As such, pursuant to DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), the Service Provider is required to provide deliverables detailing changes to or within the Government's hardware and software systems with Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS Clause 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. This will enable NGA to provide potential vendors in the follow-on competitive procurement with the information necessary for modifying the Government system to enable these services through any commercial vendor.</p>
<p>If the Service Provider wishes to assert more restrictive rights than Government Purpose Rights in any deliverable or part thereof, it shall do so in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017. Any Government requests to validate asserted restrictions will be done in accordance with the procedures in DFARS Clause 252.227-7019.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Special Notice - Special Use of Contractor Support </strong></p>
<p>a. The Government will use MITRE personnel for administrative, technical, and price analysis support during source selection. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as implemented in the FAR. MITRE personnel are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information. Contractor personnel assisting in the proposal evaluation are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act, and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a competing Contractor's proprietary data. Non-Disclosure and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificates for all contractor support personnel participating in this source selection are on file at the respective contracting activities.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Restrictions of Briefings </strong></p>
<p>During the period of source selection, which begins with release of this Request for Proposal (RFP) and ends with contract award, briefings by potential Offerors to Government agencies on the subject matter of this RFP are inappropriate. Conducting such a briefing without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may be justification for eliminating your company from further consideration under this RFP.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS and ITEMS - Pilots Background Information<br /></span><br /></strong>NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides Geospatial-Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate Geospatial-Intelligence in support of National Security. The Director of NGA is the functional manager for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), which is the combination of people, technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities and community necessary to produce Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) in an integrated multi-intelligence environment to support National Security Strategy objectives.</p>
<p>NGA is looking to change how the agency procures and provisions Information Technology in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. NGA plans on implementing a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). NGA intends to implement these services under the consolidated Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) program. In order to position the agency for successful implementation of this program, NGA is currently executing risk reduction activities and intends to award several pilots as part of these activities. The purpose of the pilot activities is to explore commercially available technologies for application in NGA facilities as well as external sites. The four pilots being contemplated are Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop (URHD) pilot, Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot, User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot, and Deployed Services (DS) pilot.</p>
<p>The URHD pilot will explore the use of a commercial Cloud as an alternative to in-house solutions. The outcome of this pilot is to determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity at a commodity price; free up one-third of data center floor space for other uses; flatten recapitalization spikes; provide efficiencies that will free up other IT resources for repurposing toward mission; and provide 24 x 7 access to voice, email, data and cloud applications via Personal Information Technology Devices (PITDs), Smart Phones, etc. NGA expects that the pilot will drive out policy concerns and solutions.</p>
<p>The Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot will explore a flexible, on-demand alternative to standard government owned data centers. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity to provide parallel operations that allows thin client transition; parallel dissemination operations; on-demand flexible capacity to allow rapid provisioning of it services; and benefit from the elimination of expensive facility modifications in limited data center space.</p>
<p>The User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot will explore flexible, on-demand alternatives to government owned user-facing hardware. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: eliminate need for multiple thin-clients at the desktop; modern, flexible, user-facing hardware; replacement or augmentation of voice and video services; and implementation of mobile thin-client devices.</p>
<p>The Deployed Services (DS) pilot will explore flexible, cross-security domain collaboration capabilities. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: deployed personnel collaboration capability for use by deployed personnel in crisis; CONUS and OCONUS situations; and a deployed PITD capability, regardless of whether an existing cell phone network exists.</p>
<p>These four pilots form an integrated architecture that mirrors the ITEMS operational objective architecture, albeit at a reduced capability and scope. By demonstrating this reduced architecture, NGA will gain high confidence in the feasibility of implementing the ITEMS approach, and detailed knowledge of how to structure the enterprise ITEMS acquisition.</p>

Acknowledge consideration of this amendment and date in proposals submitted.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and is unrestricted. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-50, March 16, 2011. The Government intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a single Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract with one (1) base year and two (2) option years. The subsequent contract will be awarded using FAR Part 13.5 procedures.<br /><br />This solicitation is being reissued pursuant to the policy memorandum dated 24 November 2010 by the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, titled "Improving Competition in Defense Procurements." The previous solicitation number was W91QUF1106C001 with a closing date of 26 April 2011.<br /><br />This solicitation is for a non-personal health care services contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical, professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The contractor indemnifies the Government for any liability producing act or omission by the contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Government requires the contractor to maintain medical liability insurance, in coverage amounts which are not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services, contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. The minimum of $3,000 shall be ordered on this contract and the maximum contract amount over the life of the contract, including all options if exercised, is $400,000. The minimum contract amount of $3,000 may be met by one or more orders during the base year of the contract.<br /><br />Primary place of performance is Togus VA Hospital, Augusta, ME, with periodic performance at various armory locations throughout the State of Maine. The capability of contractors to provide mobile-based medical services for any and all specialities in the contract is desired. Description of requirement: The Maine Army National Guard (MEARNG) requires Periodic Health Assessments (PHA) to include: dental screening and treatment, immunization updating, physical exams, phlebotomy, vision screening, womens health screening and MEDPROS and DENCLASS systems updating of service members during a one (1) year base period beginning 2 June 2011, the anticipated award date, with two (2) option years exercised at the discretion of the Government. The government may inspect facilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. (MEDPROS and DENCLASS are available through the Army Medical Operation Data System [MODS] at www.mods.army.mil.) Performance Standards: In accordance with the Performance Work Statement, the contractor shall provide, in a fixed or mobile setting, all management, labor, material, personal equipment, certifications and supplies necessary to provide Medical services, dental examinations, dental treatments, health and dental record updating, MEDPROS and DENCLASS updating. <br /><br />The first anticipated task order against the resulting ID/IQ contract is planned for 4 June 2011 for a PHA/PDHRA event.<br /><br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors---Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made based on an evaluation of the criteria of price, past performance and technical capability. Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price; 2) Past Performance; 3) Technical Capability. A consideration when evaluating technical capability will be continuity of personnel offered by the contractor. Continuity of personnel will limit the need for constant training of new personnel month to month. Past Performance and Technical Capability, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements through past performance at similar events (assessing military members for medical fitness to standards in accordance with Army Regulation 40-501, chapter 3, 7 and 8), either as the prime or first tier subcontractor, and by identification of key personnel that have past performance experience. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your proposal. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their proposal. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br /><br />CLINS renumbered as of amendment posted May 4, 2011.<br />Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs):<br />Priced 0001, Physician Services<br />Priced 0002, Physician Assistant / Nurse Practioner Services<br />Priced 0003, Registered Nurse Services<br />Priced 0004, Phlebotomist Services<br />Priced 0005, Dentist Services<br />Priced 0006, Optometrist Services<br />Priced 0007, Audiology Services<br />Priced 0008, Behavioral Health Services<br />Priced 0009, Mobile medical/dental exam facilities<br />Priced 0010, Army Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirement (yearly requirement).

<p>Government response: CLINs 1-8 (per 4 May 11 amendment) are fully-burdened hourly rates. Any travel costs shall be included in the hourly rate.</p>
<p>4. Do we need to include pricing for the CLINs in option periods? Inflation?</p>
<p>Government response: Proposals shall include pricing for base year and option periods. If unable to price option years due to uncertainty of inflation, proposals may formulaically present pricing for option years (i.e. price option years relative to base year and changes in a stated index).</p>
<p>5. Should contractors assume events are one day events, 2 days or more? Will the events be held on weekends or weekdays?</p>
<p>Government response: As noted in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), most events will be one or two days and will generally be held on weekends during regularly scheduled unit assemblies. However, longer events may be necessary to support mobilization-related requirements.</p>
<p>6. Does the Gov't have an estimate on the # of events annually? Does the Gov't have a estimate on what the average event size will be? (# of SM's).</p>
<p>Government response: An average of one event per month is anticipated and services required will vary from one task order to the next. Average event sizes vary from unit to unit but average between 150-200 SM's at weekend PHA events. The services provided under the resulting contract will be to provide health care providers of various specialities to augment MEARNG medical staff for a fixed number of hours. Task orders will state the number of providers required based on the size of the event.</p>
<p>7. CLIN 0007, Mobile Units- should these be priced as just the units or priced as the unit with necessary staff included?</p>
<p>Government response: See response to CLIN 8.</p>
<p>8. Would the Gov't be willing to separate CLIN 007 into 2 different CLINs? One for Medical Mobile and one for Dental Mobile as the cost difference between the two could be substantial.</p>
<p>Government response: The government will accept modifications to CLIN 0009's structure to include adding one or more CLINs to adequately price the mobile services component of this solicitation. This shall include separating CLIN 0009 between medical and dental and the separation of variable, transportation-related rates and on-site availability rates. There will be a minimum of 8 hours (if proposed as hourly rate) or one day (if daily rate) for each task order calling for mobile CLINs. In-service rates (available hours at site of task order performance) shall include only the necessary costs to operate the facility (i.e. include any non-medical personnel needed to operate the mobile facilities) but should exclude medical/dental specialties. The facilities provided shall be available for use by government employees (military or civilian) or contractor employees.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate evaluation of proposals, the government requests example pricing for a two-day (10 hours of availability a day) weekend event in Bangor, ME 04401. For purposes of evaluating proposals, a ten-hour work-day is assumed to allow hourly and daily rates to be compared.</p>
<p>9. What is the expected lead time the Gov't will allow the contractor to staff an event? For instance, the response date for this solicitation is May 29th, and in the solicitation it mentioned the first task order could go into effect as early as June 4th for a PHA/PDHRA event. This does not allow the contractor enough time to staff such event without possibility of major flaws.</p>
<p>Government response: As stated in the performance work statement (PWS) section 23, the government will make all efforts to give the contractor a minimum of 15 days to schedule required contract employees for each event. we ask that proposals indicate the ability to fulfill the requirements of the first task order on June 4th.</p>
<p>10. Will the Gov't supply the Immunizations if they are needed?</p>
<p>Government response: The government shall be responsible for supplying all needed immunizations.</p>
<p>11. Will the Gov't be willing to add a CLIN for Admin to help the medical/dental teams with the flow of SM's and to perform the MEDPROS and DENCLASS updates?</p>
<p>Government response: The government will not add a CLIN for admin services. Events are administered by MEARNG medical staff and MEDPROS data entry will be performed by MEARNG MEDCOM staff or in the case of PHA interviews, directly inputed by the health care provider. DENCLASS updates will be performed by MEARNG personnel.</p>

9.	End of day clean up of the work area(s) is mandatory.  There will be no exception to the daily clean up requirement.  Construction waste will be appropriately stored.  Storing construction waste near a storage trailer is not permitted.    
10.	Hot Work Permits (for welding, brazing, soldering, torch cutting, etc.) are to be applied for through the COTR.  Penetration permits for any wall or slab penetrations shall also be required.  
11.	It is presumed that the work plan includes requirements for respirators, fall prevention, hazardous materials, lockout / tag out, and confined space entry.  Therefore, the Contractors written programs must be included in the document.
12.	All hazardous materials must be submitted for review and approval by the Medical Center before they can be brought on site.  Where ever possible, it is anticipated that the least hazardous materials necessary will be used.

<DESC>**UPDATE to the Description of the sources sought**<br /><br />The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. This effort includes two projects: #1 (Project 090156) as the Base and #2 (Project 090187) as the option. 1) Project 090156, Install HTHW Lines Area A Phase 1. Project scope includes the removal of abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines, and the installation of new direct buried high temperature hot water (HTHW) lines from Facility 10271 to manhole S-57 and Facility 10286. 2) Project 090187, Install HTHW Lines Area A Phase 4. Project scope includes the removal of abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines, and the installation of new direct buried high temperature hot water (HTHW) lines from manhole S-57 to the corner of Communication Blvd and Newark St. Install HTHW lateral to Bldgs 11403, 10293, 10295 and 10296.&nbsp;Installation of new gas line to Bldgs 10879.The abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials.&nbsp; The new HTHW lines will consist of both pre-engineered direct buried piping, and piping inside new and existing concrete shallow trenches.&nbsp; Also included is the replacement of steam heat exchangers with new HTHW to heating hot water heat exchangers, hot water pumps, and new DCC controls.<br /><br />Special requirements/concerns related to this project:
<p>High Temperature Hot Water (HTHW) distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. Construction timelines are very tight since these repairs cannot be started until after the HTHW system is turned off, and must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. Work will need to be carefully coordinated with the Mechanical Shop to minimize impact to mission. Project also includes HVAC and asbestos work.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 180 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 238220 Size Standard: $14M.</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation are highly encouraged to submit the following by 10:00 a.m. (local Dayton time) <br />on 23 MAY 2011:</p>

<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation. Fax or e-mail responses will be accepted. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested <br />8(a) Region V, HUBZone, or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. Please include your DUNS Number or CAGE Code on your response. Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered "non-responsive" in this requirement. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a set-aside or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a modification in Federal Business Opportunities.</p>

<DESC>Answers to Question from Industry, SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following answers are in response to questions from industry received as of 06 May 2011.<br><br>Q1.  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), will the Government provide that contractor a fair opportunity to bid the low rate/full rate production work should a requirement exist for that production work? <br><br>A1.  How the Government will solicit the Delivery Orders will be forthcoming in the RFP and will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).<br>   <br>Q2.  Does the Government envision that this process could be streamlined by including all facets of the life cycle support in a single task order, particularly for ACAT programs?<br><br>A2.  The Government does not anticipate a single task order covering all aspects of the life cycle support of a system.  However, there may be extraordinary circumstances where a single task order covering all aspects of the life cycle support of a system is released.  Such a requirement will require the contracting officer approval and at this point the Government cannot predict the circumstances of such a release.<br><br>Q3.  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. . an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), can that contractor bid follow-on work that is a formal ACAT program (a new separate RFP, not GTACS related) where the performance requirements of the system to be designed and produced were proven to be feasible in the prototype system developed under GTACS?<br><br>A3.  The Government cannot answer this question as it relates to future contract opportunities not related to this solicitation.<br>   <br>Q4.  In this case the GTACS prime should be able to avoid work that creates elements of the new ACAT program RFP - SOW, CLIN structure, test strategy, etc.  Again, will the Government use a set of SETA contractors to develop any / all procurement data packages for these scenarios?<br><br>A4.  Please Clarify<br><br>Q5.  I am looking for the whole draft solicitation for GTACS W15P7T11RC001; I only get sections L and M.<br><br>A5.  Please refer to Answer 1 posted to FedBizOpps on 28 March 2011.<br><br>Q6.  Can the Government provide guidance on how many Offeror past performances (e.g., minimum and maximum number) will be required?<br><br>A6.  Please refer to the DRAFT Sections L and M, Pg 4, first paragraph, (ii) Volume II-Past Performance (factor) posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) and FedBizOpps on 25 March 2011.  Updates to DRAFT Sections Land M will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q7.  If an Offeror proposes with major subcontractors, can the Government provide guidance on how many major subcontractor past performances (e.g., minimum and maximum number) will be required?<br><br>A7.  Please refer to the DRAFT Sections L and M, Pg 6, [2], (c), posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) and FedBizOpps on 25 March 2011.  Updates to DRAFT Sections Land M will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q8.  Draft Sec. L.2.c.ii.e Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire indicates that the Questionnaire is to be returned to the Offeror for inclusion with the proposal. On the last page of the Questionnaire the respondent is instructed to return the completed Questionnaire to the Contracting Officer. Can the Government please clarify the instructions regarding respondents' return of completed Questionnaires?<br><br>A8.  Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire(s) are to be returned first from the POC to the Offeror for inclusion with the proposal.  Proposals will then be submitted at the appropriate RFP closing date.  Updates to the Draft Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q9.  For work performed as a subcontractor, we have found that the Government contracting officer / COR / COTR are often unwilling to provide past performance responses for a subcontractor. For work performed as a subcontractor, will the Government allow the Offeror to request Questionnaires be completed by the prime contractor's POC and by the prime contractor's technical representative (often a project or program manager)?<br><br>A9.  Yes<br><br>Q10.  Can the Government advise when they anticipate issuing attachment 4 for pricing purposes?<br><br>A10.  The Government does not intend to release a draft version of attachment 4.  The attachments will be released with the final RFP.<br><br>Q11.  Is there an incumbent contract and if so, what is the contract number?<br><br>A11.  No<br><br>Q12.  Should I expect a Q&A document to be released with this information in the future, or should I not expect an answer?<br><br>A12.  Yes, all questions from industry will be posted to FedBizOpps.<br><br>Q13.  What date do you have set for the Industry Date?<br><br>A13.  At this time, the Government has no plans for another Industry day.<br><br>Q14.  The ASFI (Response Deadline) and the FBO.gov (Response Date) have different dates. The ASFI shows 5/5/2011 and the FBO.gov shows 5/12/2011. Which is the proper due date?<br><br>A14.  The proper date is 12 May 2011.<br><br>Q15.  What do the response date citations refer to as the material that is due?<br><br>A15.  The date listed as a response date is for system purposes only.  The synopsis is an informational notice and there is no required response at this time.<br><br>Q16.  The 4/21/2011 Synopsis notice at FBO.gov states "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted."  This suggests that the Government will make no material or significant change in the final RFP as compared to what is already published for the solicitation as of 4/21/2011. Is that an accurate assumption on which one can base an early submission of proposal?<br><br>A16. No, that is not an accurate assumption.  The posted Sections L and M are drafts, as identified in the document.  The final RFP is forthcoming.<br><br>Q17.  Is it possible to schedule an in-person demonstration of our technology to those involved and/or responsible for this pre-solicitation?<br><br>A17.  Please refer to Q10 and A10 posted to FedBizOpps 06 January 2011.<br><br>Q18.  What specific information/materials, and in what format, can be deliver now to you and/or those responsible for this pre-solicitation?<br><br>A18.  Questions may be forwarded by e-mail to the points of contact listed below.<br><br>Q19.  Do we need to be on the GSA or have an existing government contract to participate in this solicitation?<br><br>A19.  No<br><br>Q20.  If schedule an in-person demonstration of our technology is unfeasible, how can we arrange for no-cost on-line brief demo of our product to interested government technical representatives?<br><br>A20.  Please refer to Q10 and A10 posted to FedBizOpps 06 January 2011.<br><br>Q 21 In accordance with the statement included in the posting of April 21, 2011 please clarify if the Government is requesting and accepting early submission of proposals and information at this time; and in advance of the issuance of the final solicitation and task orders.<br><br>A21. The Government is not accepting proposals at this time and will only accept proposals once the final RFP has been issued.<br><br>Q22.  The statement included in this posting "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted." implies the opportunity is available for the industry to submit proposals, capability statements, and information under this requirement which may be included and evaluated at the time of the final solicitation.<br><br>A22.  The Government is not accepting proposals at this time and will only accept proposals once the final RFP has been issued.<br><br><br>Q23. Our company submitted its response to your Request for Information (RFI) on January 1, 2011.  Please advise if additional information is desired and requested at this time.<br><br>A23. Additional information is not required at this point in time.<br><br>Q 24. In cases where a subcontractor on a GTACS Team is based out of Canada and has a subsidiary created for the purposes of conducting business with the U.S.  Government, where the subcontractor's rates and cost build-up formulas are typically audited by the Canadian Commercial Corp. (CCC) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), will the requirement for submission of that subcontractor's proprietary cost information "sealed data" through an Army web site be waived, and normal CCC submission of the proprietary data be acceptable.<br><br>A 24.  The contractor's forward pricing rate proposal, disclosed practices, and proposal methodology for the GTACS effort should be consistent.    <br><br>Q 25. Please advise if the Government is planning to provide responses to all the questions submitted to date under this effort.<br>A25. The Government does plan to respond to all industry questions.<br><br>Q26. Does the Government plan to issue a pipeline of the RTEPs planned for release to include Scope of Work, location and anticipated release date after award of the IDIQ vehicle?<br>A26. The Government plans to award many Delivery and Task Orders under this contract over the next 5 years. <br><br>Q27. Will IDIQ contract holders have the opportunity to make site visits prior to RTEP release, especially for efforts requiring construction?<br>A27. Depending on the requirements for individual DO/TOs issued under the GTACS contract, the Offeror will have the ability to make site visits.<br><br>Q28. We would like to respond to this draft solicitation; however the three task orders are not listed.  Could you possibly allow us to view the complete solicitation with the sample task orders or direct us to a location to view them? <br>A28. The sample tasks will be part of the final RFP.<br><br>Q29.I wanted to follow up with a request for a possible schedule; and the timeline you are planning to post responses to questions submitted to date on the GTACS effort.<br>A29.  Question will be responded to as they are submitted and as the answers are available.<br><br>Q30. Reference:  PWS Section 3.6 Personnel - The Contractor shall provide personnel having security clearances up to TOP SECRET, or as identified in applicable DO/TO.

<DESC>CLARIFICATION: <br><br>1.	The objective of this effort is to develop a new wildland fire fighter uniform system that improves wearer protection and reduces user heat stress while conducting fire fighting operations.  The uniform system may or may not consist of multiple garments.  <br><br>2.	The material performance values for Radiant Protection Performance (RPP) and the Total Heat Loss (THL) that exceed NFPA 1977-2005, refer to system level performance.  A single layer of material that meets or exceeds this threshold is desirable, however, multiple layers of material that meet or exceed these thresholds will also be considered.  <br><br>3.	If multiple layers of materials are used to achieve the required RPP of 10, the multiple layers are desired to still meet the THL minimum requirement of 500.<br><br>4.	Any single material being considered for the outer garment must meet all requirements of NFPA 1977 as certification of the outer garment is an objective of this program.   <br><br>5.	In addition, outer garment materials should be certifiable to NFPA 1975.  <br><br>6.	As a result of this change, the closing date has been extended to Friday, 20 May, 2011.<br><br><br><br>This Is A Request For Information Announcement For Purposes Of Conducting Market Research Only. There Is No Solicitation Available At This Time. Requests For A Solicitation Will Not Receive A Response. <br><br>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is conducting market research to identify flame resistant fabric materials that meet or exceed criteria defined in NFPA 1977-2005, Standard on Protective Clothing and Equipment for Wildland Fire Fighting and are suitable for use in a wild land fire fighter uniform. The National Protection Center (NPC), NSRDEC, is conducting this effort on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate. The objective of this program is to develop a new wild land fire fighter uniform system that will improve the current level of flame and heat protection while decreasing the heat stress of the wearer during fire fighting operations. This information will be used to select uniform materials for this application. The system will consist of an outer garment and next to skin inner layer garments.<br><br>All outer garment materials must meet the requirements of NFPA 1977-2005 and the following levels of protection and comfort, as determined by the following test methods:<br><br>1. Physical Characteristics<br>a. Tearing Strength, per ASTM D 1424 - 5 lb. min. <br>b. Dimensional Stability, AATCC 135 - 5.0 max<br><br>2. Comfort -<br>a. Total Heat Loss (THL), per ASTM F 1868 - THL shall be 500 or greater.<br>b. Air permeability, per ASTM D 737 - No specific performance level is required.<br><br>3. Protection -<br>a. Radiant Protective Performance (RPP), per ASTM 1939 - RPP shall be 10 or greater.<br>b. Thermal Shrinkage, per NFPA 1977-2005 - 10% max <br>c. Flame Resistance (FR), per ASTM F 6413. <br>i. After flame - 2 seconds max<br>ii. Char length - 4 inches max<br>iii. Melt/drip - none<br><br>Next to skin inner layer garments must meet the no melt/no drip criteria of ASTM F 6413. Material data for air permeability, per ASTM D 737 is desired. <br><br>Technical testing data for the above criteria must be included in your response. Data should include the test results, who performed the testing, and when it was performed. Complete testing reports are not required. <br><br>This information will be evaluated by the program office. Based on the technical data provided by each respondent, the program office will determine if materials require additional test and evaluation. The results of this program will be used by California Wild Land Fire Fighters to make decisions regarding the selection of materials for next generation duty uniforms. <br><br>Because this material is not intended for a Department of Defense or a Department of Homeland Security application nor is the procurement of a wild land fire fighter duty uniform subject to FEMA grant funding, this survey is open to all sources of textile material, both foreign and domestic, to include small businesses. The sourcing of material will need to be identified since individual state and local agencies may or may not have procurement rules or regulations pertaining to sourcing of materials or garments. <br><br>Respondents to this request for information shall submit: <br>1. A physical description of the material, including weight per square yard.<br>2. Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the comfort and performance of the material. <br>3. Indicate whether additional material is available for purchase and the lead time required for purchase. <br>4. Identify the sourcing (foreign or domestic) of the material.<br>5. Identify the cost of the material ($ USD/square yard).<br>6. Any information of prior use of this material in another uniform application.<br>7. Any attachments shall be in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format.<br><br>The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information submitted in response to this sources sought request. Submission of information or samples is voluntary. Any proprietary information will be held confidential. Business concerns submitting responses should indicate whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone or service disabled veteran owned small business. Large business concerns are not prohibited from responding to this announcement. There is no planned procurement action that will accompany this program. <br><br>All interested business concerns are required to respond to this request for information announcement via email no later than Friday, 20 May 2011, 3:00 p.m. EST. Responses must include company point of contact, email address, telephone and fax numbers. All interested business concerns responding to this announcement shall send their submission to Fred Chan via email at fred.chan@us.army.mil. All technical questions regarding this sources sought announcement should be directed via email towards Fred Chan at fred.chan@us.army.mil. <br><br>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE. <br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to solicit proposals from sources for support for interdisciplinary studies. This support services contract is essential for GEB to maintain its program of family studies and to develop strategies for larger population studies. Family studies are an important platform for discovery of genetic variation related to cancer. They are also an important component of the NCI's focus on consortia, and represent a paradigm of collaborative, coordinated efforts with multiple extramural colleagues. This project is also responsive to Congressional mandates in that we are focusing on melanoma and lymphoproliferative disorders. <br /><br />The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international family studies and field (case-control and cohort) studies. All of the studies are interdisciplinary, most with biospecimen collection. Since 2005, the contract has actively assisted in the conduct of over 24 investigations, including all of our family studies activities. For planned new studies, as well as for ongoing studies, the overarching scientific goals are: to map and identify cancer susceptibility genes within high risk families; to assess penetrance and modifiers of penetrance in mutation carriers; to elucidate the natural history and define clinical spectrum of disease for specific conditions; to evaluate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions when possible in families and larger populations; to evaluate the significance of mutations in identified genes within larger populations.<br /><br />The acquisition will contain Mandatory Criteria's that must be met at the time of receipt of technical proposals: <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Frequent Face-to-Face Discussions<br /></span>The offeror must demonstrate how it will accomplish the task of attendance at face-to-face discussions, on a nearly daily basis, between the NCI project officers and the Project Director and/or nursing staff or project managers of individual studies in order to monitor and review progress on project activities.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Nearby Family Studies Medical Record Room<br /></span>The offeror must demonstrate how it will maintain the Family Studies Medical Record Room at a secure location which will assure that patient records will be delivered to the Project Officer at the Executive Plaza North Building, 6120 Executive Blvd, Rockville, Maryland within thirty (30) minutes of a request.<br /><br />The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and 6 (six) 1-year options of performance beginning on or about September 1, 2011.<br /><br />The RFP will be available electronically on or about May 26, 2011 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted.<br /><br /><strong>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO REVISE THE CLASSIFICATION CODE FROM "B" TO "R", DUE TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR.</strong>

<DESC><strong>****&nbsp; This notice is hereby modified to correct Solicitation number in text of Description from NCI-110064-TG&nbsp;to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NCI-110063-TG</span>.&nbsp; All responses submitted with solication NCi-110064-TG will be deemed valid and will be accepted. *****<br /><br />Description<br /></strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Center Research (CCR), Medical Oncology Branch (MOB) plans to procure the brand name SpectraMax&reg; M5 Automatic Fluorescence Intensity, Time Resolved Fluorescence, Fluorescence Polarization, Absorbance and Luminescence Microplate Reader manufactured by Molecular Devices. The governments preference is to purchase refurbished equipment. <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />Delivery Date: 90 days from date of award.<br /><br />A Spectramax M5-R is a UV-visible microplate reader providing ultrafast, full spectral range detection for various sample formats including cuvettes, 96-well and 384-well microplates, with the only temperature-independent method for path length correction. Fluorescence polarization is necessary for projects involving FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) assays, identifying interactive partners in signaling networks, which are primary technology to be utilized in NCI's quantitive proteomics laboratory.<br /><br />The following salient characteristics apply to the SpectraMax&reg; M5 Plate Reader:<br /><br />&bull; Fluorescence polarization capability- necessary for projects involving FRET assays; fluorescence polarization measurements provide information on molecular orientation and mobility and processes that modulate them, including receptor-ligand interactions, protein-DNA interactions, proteolysis, membrane fluidity and muscle contraction. Because polarization is a general property of fluorescent molecules, polarization-based readouts are somewhat less dye dependent and less susceptible to environmental interferences such as pH changes than assays based on fluorescence intensity measurements alone. <br /><br />&bull; Monochromator reading function- (non filter based) allows adjustable excitation/emission wavelengths which are desirable for standardizing the optimal wavelength required for different assays. <br /><br />&bull; PMTs/auto PMT function- multiple photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for detection flexibility in a wide variety of assays; an automatic PMT electronic calibration systems avoid saturation of PMTs for accurate sample recording. <br /><br />&bull; Path length measurement technology-measures optical depth of samples with no temperature-dependency that could affect sample concentration measurements<br /><br />The Molecular Devices Spectramax M5 Plate reader is the only known product with all the characteristics listed above. The Spectramax M5 Plate reader fulfills the NCI's requirements and scientific options integral to the research, specifically the patented PathCheck sensor which is not affected by temperature and requires no accessories to measure the path length of the sample in each individual microplate well. The sensor on this microplate reader enables the ability to calculate concentrations without a standard curve, test liquid handling devices, detect and correct for pipetting errors and expand the dynamic range of the assay.<br /><br />Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov or fax (301) 402-4513 by May 23, 2011 11:00 am. Interested parties shall include the name of company; complete mailing address; point of contacts, phone, fax numbers, and email address; company DUNS number and business size.<br /><br />All questions shall be in writing and may be addressed to the aforementioned individual noted above. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). <br /><br />Reference: RFQ-NCI-110063-TG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, repair parts, tools, and equipment to repair and restore the masonry building exterior, roof systems, limited interior repairs, window glazing, XL piping, and below grade waterproofing at the Edward T. Gignoux Courthouse, Portland, Maine. The Courthouse was built in 1911 with a major addition constructed in 1931 in the Italian Renaissance Revival styles. All work is required to comply with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Primary work items will include masonry repointing, restoration and cleaning, window restoration and reglazing, removal/reinstallation of the existing slate roof system and installation of a new copper perimeter roof system, restoration of window and door sealants, and salvaging of exterior stairs. Provisions for upgrading the existing window glazing with laminated insulated glazing, limited replacement of the current non-compliant XL sprinkler piping and courtyard waterproofing will be addressed as bid options. Work shall also include limited historical lime plaster interior restoration and paint finishes. <br /><br /><br />
<p align="left">The work for all Base Bid Work and Bid Options shall be sequenced in accordance with the approved schedule by the US Courts, US Marshalls, and GSA in order to provide for the safety, security, temporary parking, utility services, and mission critical functions required by the building occupants during the work of this contract. The work shall be sequenced as indicated. Continued Government operations of the US Courts and Marshals Service shall be maintained without exception. Phasing and careful contractor coordination will be required as the building will be fully occupied during the proposed renovation. The contractor shall also be required to maintain the integrity of the existing building security, secure construction staging and avoid any procedures which would compromise the building's security perimeter.</p>
<p><br />Performance period is 690 calendar days after the receipt of the notice to proceed and this will be a firm fixed price contract. This is a best value competitive negotiated procurement set-aside for small business concerns; offers from large businesses will not be considered. NAICS is 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million.</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit both written technical and price proposals. Offers will be evaluated on technical capability and price, with technical quality being approximately equal to price. Evaluation Factors are: (1) Proven past performance in providing general construction services in historic renovation, restoration and reproduction on projects of similar size. (2) Qualifications and experience of key personnel. (3) Management Plan and Technical Approach. (4) Proven plan to procure, and manage eight (8) technically qualified Specialty Sub-contractors listed in the Contract Specifications. The estimated cost range for this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. A bid guarantee is required and the offerors must provide evidence that they can provide Performance and Payment Bonds after award.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference will be conducted by GSA on Tuesday, May 17, 2011 at 10:00 AM. Contractors shall meet at the Edward T. Gignoux Federal Courthouse, 156 Federal Street, Portland, Maine. The Government considers attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive offer as it will enable the Contractor to become acquainted with the work areas and that it is more advantageous for each Offeror to have qualified representation at the pre-proposal conference. As Offerors may not be able to re-enter buildings after the tour, and cameras are not allowed on federal property, all Offerors are cautioned to see all areas as they deem necessary during the tour, in order to augment their ability to submit an informed proposal. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions or miscalculations in offers. No questions can be answered during the tour therefore; all questions need to be submitted in writing to the contracting officer. While the conference will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify the solicitation provisions, any information received at the pre-proposal is not official or binding and nothing said or represented in the conference will be deemed to modify the solicitation requirements unless followed by a written amendment.</p>
<p>The solicitation, agreement, specifications, drawings and other applicable documents&nbsp;will be&nbsp;available for electronic download at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov on May 11, 2011. No other notifications will be sent. No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued, and telephone, fax, or email requests for this solicitation will not be accepted. Contract Award is Subject to the Availability of Funds.</p>

Authority Cited - Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - "Only One or a Limited Number of Responsible Sources and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br><br>5.  Reason for Authority Cited - Pursuant to the provisions of Public Law No. 108-136, National Defense Authorization Act Fiscal Year 2004, Section 802, Quality Control in Procurement of Aviation Critical Safety Items (CSI) and Related Services, as implemented for acquisition by Department of Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS 209.270), contracts for modification, repair, or overhaul of CSI items can only be awarded to a source approved by the head of the design control activity.  The Directorate for Engineering has determined that this part is a CSI. The Valve, Assembly was determined a CSI on 31 October 2005.  The only approved sources are AAR Aircraft Component (Cage 3Y015), Honeywell International Inc. (Cage 59364), General Electric Company (Aircraft Engine Business Group) (Cage 99207) and TAT Technologies (Cage S4883).  The required output delivery schedule is anticipated to be 120 days after receipt of assets to the overhaul/repair facility.<br>    <br>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition - This action was originally synopsized through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on 27 August 2008 and 04 September 2008 as required by FAR 5.201, prior to issuance of the solicitation of the requirement.  The only approved sources are shown in para 5. Additional sources identified through the synopsis procedure will receive due consideration as prescribed by law.  This item was published in the Competition Advocate's Shopping List (CASL) dated June 2009.  This action was originally synopsized as two separate actions.  An amendment to the synopsis was issued on 24 July 2009 combining the two actions (08KT128 and 08LT128).   These two actions must be combined because this item is provisioned to rework the configurations to be corrosion resistant.  Part Number 5066T38G04 will be upgraded to P/N 5066T38G08. This upgrade will make it corrosion resistant.  Part Number 5066T38G07 is currently corrosion resistant.  This requirement will be limited to the four approved sources identified in para 5.<br><br>7.  Actions to Increase Competition - Depot Maintenance Work Requirement (DMWR) 1-2995-241-dated 30 September 1992, with Change 2, is currently available to support a competitive solicitation; however this item has been identified as a CSI and as such requires overhaul/modification from an approved source in accordance with DFARS,  Subpart 209.2 oer Sustainment Engineers Division, AED, AMSRD-AMR-AE-K. The only approved sources for this item are stated in Para 5. The Army Aviation Sustainment Gateway (ARISE) database was queried on 02 October 2009 and there are no pending Source Approval Requests (SAR's)  Based on reasons stated in paragraph 5, a more effective competition is not anticipated. <br><br>8.  Market Research - Market Research was conducted within the last 12 months in accordance with FAR 10.002, including personal knowledge of technical representatives, contacting knowledgeable persons in Government and industry, and review of government and/or commercial databases for relevant information.  This requirement can be met by commercial items; therefore FAR Part 12 will be utilized for this acquisition.  This item was last published in the AMCOM CASL in June 2009. <br><br>9.  Interested Sources - In accordance with FAR 5.201, this requirement was published in FedBizOpps on 27 August 2008 and 04 September 2008.  An amendment to the synopsis was issued on 24 July 2009 combining the two PRIDs (08KT128 and 08LT128).  All interested sources identified through the market research and FedBizOpps will receive due consideration as prescribed by law.  Submission of this item in the June 2009 Competition Advocate's Shopping List will allow other sources to submit data and request approval as a qualified source.  Interested sources identified through the market research and FedBizOpps are Aero Turbine Inc, and Alco Aircraft Logistics Support.  Both contractors were instructed to seek SAR approval in order to compete for this or future solicitations by submitting documentation in accordance with the Competition Advocate's Shopping List (CASL) procedures. Contractors were notified these procedures are outlined at the following web site: http://www.redstone.army.mil/cmo/ on 23 July 2009.  To date neither contractor has submitted their request for SAR approval. <br><br>10.  Other Factors -<br><br> a.   There is a reasonable basis to conclude that only AAR Aircraft Component, Honeywell International Inc., TAT Technologies, or General Electric Co. can satisfy the needs of the Government at this time.  These four sources are the only approved sources of overhaul for this Critical Safety Item.<br> b.   Follow-on acquisition is not anticipated to be fully competitive due to reasons stated in paragraph 5 above.  <br>  c. Procurement History:  <br>      <br>            Contract W58RGZ-05-D-0231 was awarded using the authority of FAR 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.(Sole Source) to Honeywell International. <br><br> Contract No. /D.O.                   Award Date           Qty                 U/P               Total Cost<br>W58RGZ-05-D-0231/0015       11 Jul 2008            300 Each     $5,536.00    $1,660,800.00    <br>W58RGZ-05-D-0231/0008       14 Dec 2006          580 Each     $5,321.00    $3,086,180.00<br>W58RGZ-05-D-0231/0003       22 Nov 2005          523 Each    $5,217.00     $2,728,491.00<br><br>Contract W58RGZ-05-D-0231 consisted of several Output NSNs.  The procurement history stated above is for Output NSN 2995-01-460-1334 only.  The procurement history for Input NSN 2995-01-305-6942 lists Valco Industries as a source, however, Valco Industries is a manufacturing source not a repair source.<br> <br>d. Acquisition Data Availability -Technical data is currently available to support a full and open competitive solicitation; however, this is a CSI and therefore must be overhauled by an approved source.<br><br>e.   Subcontracting Competition- Per FAR 19.702 and FAR 19.704, a subcontracting plan is required for large businesses on negotiated acquisitions that exceed $550,000.  According to FAR 19.704 the contractor must include FAR 52.219-8, entitled Utilization of Small Business Concerns in all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities (except small businesses) to adopt a plan that complies with requirements of the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, which covers Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Business, Hub-Zone Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns.  A Subcontracting Plan will be required from AAR Aircraft Component, Honeywell International Inc., and General Electric Company.  TAT Technologies will not be required to submit a subcontracting plan per FAR 19.702 (b)(3) Statutory Requirements. Contractors performing entirely outside the United States and its outlying areas are not required to submit a subcontracting plan. <br>
