<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR PREPREG THICKNESS VARIABILITY REDUCTION. This is an announcement that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to award a Sole Source contract. The AFRL, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/RXM) is contemplating the award of a cost-reimbursement type contract to Cytec Engineered Materials Inc., 1440 N Kraemer Blvd., Anaheim, CA 92806 for the program entitled "Prepreg Thickness Variability Reduction" under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source." <br />The F-35 has stringent requirements to maintain Outer Mold Line (OML) flushness. In doing so, the program incurs significant manufacturing costs and long manufacturing span times. Reducing the Cured Ply Thickness (CPT) variation is an identified area with potential to reduce these manufacturing burdens. A leading contributor to CPT variation is the raw material, prepreg inconsistency. The contracted effort shall work with F-35 qualified prepreg materials (IM7/977-3 &amp; IM7/5250-4) and improvements shall be implemented on qualified manufacturing lines producing such materials. The materials and manufacturing processes/equipment are proprietary to Cytec Ind. The F-35 JPO believes that deviating from qualified materials and the vendor who produce it would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. To pursue other than F-35 qualified materials would require tens of millions of dollars in government funding to certify alternate materials, perform airframe certification tests and three batch vendor qualification testing. The qualification effort would also take several years to complete while F-35 systems are being built today.<br />Under the contemplated contract, the vendor shall investigate and improve prepreg processing techniques (resin mixing, filming, creeling, spreading, slitting, etc.) on qualified F-35 materials (977-3 and 5250-4 Cytec Inc. resins), reducing thickness variation. Improvements shall be implemented on approved F-35 prepreg material manufacturing lines. To demonstrate improvements, multiple prepreg batches shall be produced using information learned and validate composite cured ply thickness control by fabricating multiple full scale parts. It is planned that the sole source contract will be awarded for $1,399,960.00. Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above by 13MAY2008. Responses must be submitted to William Beeman, Contracting Officer, via email at William.beeman@wpafb.af.mil . Responses received after 13MAY2008 or without the required information will be considered no-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fbo.gov. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Direct questions to the contract point of contact identified in the announcement. Inquiries pertaining to this acquisition should be addressed to William O. Beeman, Contracting Officer, telephone: (937) 255-7143, facsimile: (937) 255-5302, e-mail: William.beeman@wpafb.af.mil, or Emmeline Spaulding, Contract Negotiator, telephone: (937) 255-5069, facsimile: (937) 255-5302, e-mail: emmeline.spaulding@wpafb.af.mil. Technical questions may be addressed to Robert Thomson, Project Engineer, AFRL/RXMP, telephone: (937) 904-4598, e-mail: Robert.Thomson@WPAFB.AF.MIL. All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency.

This acquisition will provide Contractor Logistic Support for the RERP peculiar systems of the C-5M aircraft for the time period between the cessation of such services provided by Lockheed Martin Corporation under the C-5 RERP System Development and Demostration (SDD) contract, and the initiation of such services under the planned Air Logistics Command C-5M sustainment contract . The period of performance will be from 01 February 2009 through 31 Mar 2012.  A complete reprocurement data package for neither the legacy C-5 nor the C-5M is available.  The Government does not currently possess C-5 data rights.  The 716 AESG believes that LMA is the only known weapon system manufacturer capable of performing this effort, as they own the required data.  Since the Government plans to issue a sole source solicitation, an additional synopsis will not be issued. The approximate issue date of the solicitation will be 16 June 2008. The approximate response date of the solicitation will be 04 October 2008.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Potential subcontractors should contact Lockheed Martin directly.  The point of contact at Lockheed is Bruce Farmer, (770) 494-2229.

1.	Introduction - This work is to prepare a technical report that will describe various methods to measure near surface moisture content of concretes and mortars that will have polymeric adhesives applied to them.  
2.	Background - Reclamation is currently performing research work to prepare design and material specifications for repair of Prestressed Concrete Pipe (PCP), including Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP), using carbon fiber mats glued to the inside of the pipe.  A critical element of this work is determining the moisture content of the concrete or mortar lining of these pipes prior to application of the polymeric adhesive that is used to glue the carbon fiber mats in place.  The performance of these types of adhesives is very dependent on the moisture content of the surface they are bonding to.  Accurately and rapidly determining the moisture content of the concrete or mortar just prior to application of the repair material will help to ensure that the adhesives are used correctly in suitable exposure conditions.  
3.	Scope.  The work entails performing a literature search, contacting peers in the industry, reviewing past related research and project work, and preparing a report.  The report should describe various methods to measure the moisture content of concrete and mortars at and near the surface.  The descriptions should address strengths and weaknesses of the various methods.  The report shall then make a recommendation or recommendations on the best method(s) to use to measure the moisture content.  As much detail as needed to include the information in a guide standard shall be provided.
4.	Technical Requirements - 	Task 1 - Perform a literature search and document results in a summary.		Task 1b - Submit for review and comment.	Task 2 - Contact other experts as appropriate and document results in a summary.		Task 2b - Submit for review and comment.	Task 3 - Prepare a draft report.		Task 3b - Submit for review and comment.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is pursuing a Justification and Approval citing 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Bosque Engineering is the proposed sole-source contractor with which Reclamation proposes to contract to (1)  Assist the San Carlos Apache Tribe and tribal farm with planning, market strategy development, predesign, design, and construction of farm expansion of up to 750 acres; and to (2)  Assist the San Carlos Apache Tribe with development of an economic development plan based on an vertically integrated economy which will demonstrate a higher value of water than is generally associated with farming primarily one crop.  Bosque Engineering has been engaged by the San Carlos Apache Tribal Farm (an entity of the tribe - owned and controlled by the Tribe) to assist with marketing, planning, and development of business strategies for the existing farm.  As such, Bosque Engineering is privy to tribal-wide financial data, tribal strategic planning data, and data regarding historic farming practices.  This proprietary data is integral to the completion of the above-listed tasks.  Work under this contract will consist of two parts: Part I will consist of Agricultural Development around the Gila River.  The Contractor shall define agricultural goals and objectives; collect and analyze existing data; work with the farm and the farm board in irrigation system planning and development; and analyze a development of the river diversion system and design.  Part 2 will consist of the conduct of an economic development study culminating in an implementable comprehensive, vertically-integrated economic development plan. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 and the Small Business size standard is $4.5M.  This will be a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this sole source contract action, however, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Responses must be received by Close of Business (COB) May 13, 2008.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     The Contracting Officer has determined that the authorities cited in FAR 6.301-1 provide the rationale for other than full and open competition.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  It is anticipated that this project will be awarded by May 20, 2008.  Point of contact is Deborah Talbert, Contract Specialist, 623-773-6287.  Email your questions to Bureau of Reclamation - Phoenix Area Office - at dtalbert@lc.usbr.gov.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with RMA – The Risk Management Association.  The period of performance will be one year with four option years.  The purpose is to provide an online off-the-shelf product that provides comparative industry analysis, reports on current credit risk topics as well as an assessment tool “Credit Diagnostic” that measures the taker’s credit related knowledge and also provides remedial resources.  This requirement is an essential and foundational resource for training OCC examiners about credit risk, as they advance through the pre-commissioned training program’s credit curriculum.  Without access to e-Mentor, OCC would be required to revise several classroom based credit courses.  

OCC requires consistency in credit risk diagnostic tests taken by OCC’s bank examiners.  The initial curriculum was developed by RMA – The Risk Management Association, therefore they will revalidate the curriculum development process.  It is imperative to obtain a baseline measure of the bank examiners credit skill level.  The revised credit risk diagnostic curriculum shall identify examiner credit skill levels and also measure progress in enhancing those skills.  Because diagnostics are structured differently (e.g., different key categories, different questions), all of the work to-date in establishing a baseline and using it to craft the new credit curriculum be lost if OCC were to change contractors, thus changing diagnostics.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document is available.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC.

<DESC><p>President Bush announced in August 2007, a series of initiatives to address border security and immigration challenges in the United States. The President's plan consists of 26 actions designed to secure the borders and to address needed immigration reforms. Number 26 of the plan states, "The Department of Education Will Launch A Free, Web-Based Portal To Help Immigrants Learn English, And Expand This Model Over Time. Knowledge of English is the most important component of assimilation. An investment in tools to help new Americans learn English will be repaid many times over in the contributions these immigrants make to our political discourse, economy, and society." The Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has created USA Learns (www.usalearns.org), an online learning environment, designed for low-level English Language Learners (ELL) to fulfill the President's promise. This project is authorized under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, Title II of Public Law 105-220, Section 243, National Leadership Activities.
<p>OVAE developed a feasibility study for an adult education learner portal to help implement the president's proposal. As part of the feasibility study, developed under U.S. Department of Education contract number ED05CO0062, with the University of Michigan, ending on September 29, 2008, a prototype was constructed for low-level ELL students to provide OVAE with as much information as possible about what support adults require to be successful on-line learners. That contract, Strengthening Programs Through Technology, has produced a complete feasibility study and a web portal prototype, USA Learns.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Department requires a contractor to:<br />A. Maintain and expand functionality of USA Learns.<br />B. Expand access of USA Learns.<br />C. Maintain two self-assessment tools housed on www.adultedonline.org.<br />D. Report to the Department the progress of the USA Learns portal.</p>
<p>The Department plans for a period of performance of a base year with two one-year options. Further, a cost reimbursement with award fee type contract is contemplated. The Department will consider a Fixed Price or a Fixed Price with Award Fee offer.</p>
<p>The contractor shall propose the technical approach, the personnel and management plan necessary to accomplish this project. The contractor shall also coordinate with the National Institute for Literacy to accomplish the tasks. Deliverables shall include:<br />- A fully functioning website.<br />- A transition in plan from the old website to the new website.<br />- A transition out plan from the new website when the contract ends. <br />- A schedule of recommended updates. <br />- Self-Assessment tools for English Language Learners are made fully functional.<br />- Scheduled updates to the Department.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any comments on this pre-solicitation notice should be sent to the contacts provided. Please ensure that the name of the company, a point of contact, viable e-mail address, and telephone number are clearly indicated on your submission. Responses to questions will be posted to the following website: https://www.fbo.gov/. With the exception of written questions pertaining to this requirement, ED will not accept written correspondence, literature or other proposal-type submissions. The Department anticipates release of the draft statement of work during the week of April 28th and the RFP on May 5, 2008 with a closing date of June 5, 2008.</p>
<p>The contractor must possess the highest security clearance that the U.S. Department of Education requires: a background check for all employees involved with the portal.

<CONTACT>Daniel L Confer, Contract Specialist, Phone (202)366-0730, Fax (202) 366-3705, Email daniel.confer@dot.gov
<DESC>In the last several years, structural health monitoring technologies have emerged creating an exciting new field within various branches of engineering. These technologies are currently becoming increasingly common in monitoring the health of many types of structures. This new approach collects data about critical structural elements using sensors to provide indicators when problems are detected within a structure.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to issue a Full and Open Competitive Request for Proposals (RFP, Solicitation) for research and development of new advanced sensor systems which could be applied to pavements.  The purpose of this solicitation is to stimulate creative technological innovation, conduct research to advance the state of the art, and increase the commercial application of these research results.   

Although the RFP is still currently being formulated, it contemplates that research will be conducted in a number of phases ranging from concept development to laboratory and field feasibility demonstrations. Research may be focused on determining the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of proposed new advanced sensor systems, their quality of performance, and their suitability for use in monitoring pavements. Ideally, technologies such as wireless communications, data acquisition and sensors would be integrated to monitor appropriate physical properties of asphalt and concrete pavements which could indicate the onset of pavement distresses (e.g., stress and strain within the pavement, cracking, temperature, moisture, etc.). These indicators might then be reported to a pavement management system. It is envisioned that more than one type of sensoring system may be needed to adequately assess the health of a pavement and that these should work together to give a picture of the onset of pavement distresses. In order to maximize innovation, researchers should be drawn from diverse disciplines perhaps including, civil, electrical, computer and mechanical engineering.  This effort will likely require expertise in the areas of pavement distress analysis, pavement condition data collection procedures, pavement management, and data mining and analysis.  

Offerors with unique but narrow capabilities are encouraged to team their talent and resources with other entities in submitting their proposals. Again, offerors are cautioned that the solicitation is currently still in development, and that the information contained in this synopsis is subject to change. When released, the solicitation will be the sole vehicle by which requirements and guidance related to this effort are distributed.

This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competition. All potential sources are encouraged to submit proposals, either individually, or in teams. The RFP will be released in the near future, and will be available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested parties may register at the aforementioned site to receive notification of this action, as well as a variety of other procurement announcements and information. It is the responsibility of offerors to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any amendments or additional information related to the RFP package and this procurement. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541712 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement to support research identifying ways to effectively treat bacterial infections with antimicrobials that minimize the development of drug resistance.

This BAA targets infectious diseases where improved treatment strategies could reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance and preserve the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials.  A central goal of this solicitation is to target disease areas experiencing the greatest antimicrobial selective pressure, and within these areas, develop strategies that test the safety and effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches/regimens that reduce the probability of the emergence of drug resistance by minimizing unnecessary drug exposure.

Contracts to be awarded under this BAA will support the design and conduct of Phase III and/or Phase IV clinical trials of new strategies for the use of licensed, off-patent antimicrobial therapies to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance in selected infectious diseases.  

For the purposes of this BAA, the disease areas of interest are the following:(1) Acute otitis media; (2) Pneumonia; (3) Urinary tract infections; and (4) Bacteremia.

Both community- and hospital-associated infections in these disease areas are eligible.
 
For the purposes of this BAA, the experimental variables of interest are the following: (1) Need for antimicrobial therapy (single or combination therapy); (2) 	Length of antimicrobial therapy; and (3) Frequency/dosage of antimicrobial therapy. 

Eligible strategies may include, but are not limited to: (1) Shorter treatment duration for pneumonia and other infections, e.g., otitis media, urinary tract infections and bacteremia; (2) Different dosage or frequency, supported by PK/PD data, where optimal treatment has not been well defined, e.g., the use of penicillin in penicillin-resistant pneumonia; or (3) Withholding of antimicrobials (altogether) for certain diseases, e.g., otitis media and identifying eligible populations for this type of strategy. 

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about June 1, 2009.    

The NIAID estimates that the total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) available for all contract awards is $9.1 million per year.  However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s).  The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed seven years.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about May 12, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Estimated price range: $3,000,000 to $3,800,000 including options.
Time for completion: Fifteen months, approximately July 2008 through October 2009. If options are awarded, contract time will be extended as appropriate to complete the additional work.
Proposal receipt date is approximately June 16, 2008; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 811213   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to award a sole source purchase order to the current provider, MotoSAT Inc, for continued maintenance on EPA'sNational Decontamination Team's (NDT) satellite broadband service in the Mobile Communications Center (MCC).  The equipment was originally purchased from MotoSAT and is currently maintained by them as well. It has been determined that this acquisition be awarded sole source based on the fact that down time and additional costs would be incurred by EPA in terms of replacement of equipment, training personnel for new equipment, etc if a new vendor were to be chosen.  Market research has also shown that other companies offer service-only options but charge additional fees for service if their equipment is not used.  This would not be cost effective to the government.  EPA's NDT is requesting satellie broadband service in the MCC for the next twelve (12) months.  This service is necessary to maintain the MCC as a Type II FEMA MCC.  The MCC currently has Motosat equipment and broadband service to maintain its specialized and redundant voice communication system.  There are six (6) objectives to this maintenance agreement: (1) Dedicated band width at least ten days per month specifically for Emergency Response events with the option of up to one full month; (2) VOIP port configuration; (3) Twelve-month nation-wide shared plan with unlimited calls within the United States; (4) Service to four lines in the MCC; (5) Data dedicated service with a minimum of 768 kbps up to 2 Mbps and (6) Maintain continuity of current system operation and be compatible with the F-3 Datastorm satellite dish.  The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is: 811213.  The period of performance for this award is not to exceed twelve months.  The EPA has only one known source for this procurement that is in the government's best interest.  If there are any other potential sources, submit your capability statement via email to the US Environmental Protection Agency, c/o Elaine Scott at scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than 2 PM, EST May 9, 2008.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) in Washington, DC intends to award a purchase order to the American Council for an Energy EfficientEconomy (ACEEE) of Washington, DC using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the specific authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The purpose of this acquisition is to perform an unbiased review of home energy consumption assessments in order to review the role energy audits play as an implementation tool in reducing energy consumption in the residential sector. This review will quantify the level of action and follow-through homeowners took to make the recommended approvals based on the various types of home audits currently available. The main objective of this procurement is to determine whether comprehensive home energy assessments or more simplified audits are effective in promoting energy efficiency and spurring homeowner action.  Under this order, ACEEE will identify a broad cross section of audit programs representing a wide geographic area that have been currently active. ACEEE will research the effectiveness of these home audits and financial incentives or programmatic features that facilitate energy-efficient home improvements. ACEEE will develop recommendations for effective audit programs based on this research and provide a final report to EPA.  NO SOLICIATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. ACEEE is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as it is the only known non-profit organization that has successfully managed an unbiased platform for dialogue concerning energy efficiency initiatives within the industry. In addition, its unparalleled access to utility programs implemented over the past 20 years and its high level of credibility within the energy efficiency community will allow for access to data and networks to support an unbiased analysis and document its findings. Further, ACEEE's staff directors of energy efficient utilities programs are involved in ongoing monitoring of utility sector energy efficiency policies and programs, and the identified analysts are leaders in their respective fields of study. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying EPA's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered. Reponses must be submitted in writing to Mr. Jami J. Rodgers, Contracting Officer, at rodgers.jami@epa.gov. A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The estimated value of this procurement is under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Perishables Group, 1700 Irving Park Road, Suite 310, Chicago, IL  60613 for the acquisition of fresh seafood department sales data.  The contractor shall provide raw data of monthly point-of-sale syndicated data for fresh seafood department sales. The data set shall include the retail banners in New York and New Jersey at the zip code level of geography, as well as providing for comparison an overall total U.S., for the years 2006 and 2007.  The data shall also include all seafood categories with all levels of detail (department, super category, category, subcategory, segment, item group, item level).
Metadata and data dictionary shall be provided with the raw data.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 3 months from date of award.  The Perishables Group is the only source able to provide fresh seafood market data down to the lowest geographic resolution (zip code level) for total seafood department sales for different fish species reportable for individual banner stores.  The lowest level of geographic resolution is needed for the overall success of the two RARE (Regional Applied Research Effort) projects described in the Statement of Work.  
The Perishables Group is unique as it is the only source that can also provide species-level fresh fish and shellfish data down to the store level for the entire United States.  The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106(b) - only one source reasonably available and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541712, with a small business size standard of 500 employees, is applicable.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  
Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualifications fully explaining their capability  and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. No later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Consequently, any response failing to provide evidence of the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.   Submit response to US EPA, Attn: James E. Wesley, II RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 via US Postal Service.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) anticipates issuing a Request for Quotation to a single source, Werres Corporation, for two Raymond brand name EASi Reach-Fork 24 Volt Trucks with the following specifications:
3,000 pound capacity
43" baseleg opening
91" collapsed mast height
204" elevated fork height
Forks, chisel type
Forks, 42"
Manual, operations/parts/maintenance
Reverse steering
Steered idler caster
Battery, 12-H120-15, 24 Volt Hydra Saver
Assembly, local dealer setup and preflight test (reverse steering)

Delivery, FOB destination, is required no later than 90 days after purchase order award.

Pursuant to FAR 5.102(a)(6), 13.106-1(b)(1) and 13.106-1(b)(3), the following combined brand name and single source justification is provided:   

COMPACT SIZE:  The compactness and superior maneuverability of the Raymond Reach-Truck is particularly necessary in SSA's Supply Building and Operations Building loading docks and particularly in the Security West location.  SSA's Security West Building in particular offers little space to operate and maneuver a reach truck.  Currently, other brand name reach trucks are not being used because they are more difficult and less desirable to operate.  

MAINTENANCE FREE BATTERIES:   The EASi Reach-Fork 24 Volt Truck with a 3,000 pound capacity is unique with regards to the 24 volt batteries which only requiring watering several times a year, making them practically maintenance free.  SSA's experience with other brands of reach trucks is frequent replacement of dead batteries (approximately $2,500 per battery), rendering the material handling equipment excessively idle and more costly.

MAINTENANCE:  Werres Corporation currently holds a five-year mechanic handling equipment maintenance contract with the SSA.  Werres' service technicians carry most Raymond parts on-site and are certified annually by Raymond Corporation which provides effective, efficient and prompt problem diagnosis and remedies.

SAFETY:  SSA personnel are familiar with and are fully trained and certified in the operation of Raymond material handling equipment.

The brand name circumstances described above deem only one source, Werres Corporation, reasonable available.  Werres Corporation is the only authorized distributor of Raymond brand equipment in the local area.

SSA anticipates release of the Request for Quoatation (SSA-RFQ-07-1771) on or about April 30, 2008.  A statement challenging the above combined brand name and single source justification accompanied by a capability statement providing that a particular brand name other than Raymond and/or a firm other than Werres Corporation can meet the Government's requirements must be received by email to bridget.hamel@ssa.gov no later than noon, local prevailing time, April 30, 2008.  All questions must be submitted in writing via e-mail to bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  E-mail communications shall include company name, address, point of contact, e-mail address, phone and fax numbers.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The estimated cost range for this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The solicitation will be available on of about May 15, 2008.  The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access DS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled “Register with FedTeDS” and then choosing the “Vendor Registration Form” hyperlink.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  (Your Company’s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company’s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company’s DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for Advanced Technology (AT) X-ray systems for screening passenger carry-on baggage to be used in our Nation’s airports.  The TSA will examine each offeror’s response to this announcement to determine those vendors who have satisfactorily met the minimum requirements as specified in the white paper requirements section of this announcement.  The TSA will then establish a Qualified Product List (QPL) based on the overall performance of each offeror’s AT against TSA specifications and reasonableness of price.  Only offerors that respond to this announcement and who demonstrate that they can fulfill TSA’s requirements will be eligible for placement onto the QPL.  This will be an Open Qualified Products List.  Vendors will be able to submit white papers to the contracting officer at any time, although testing will only occur on a periodic basis.  If the product fails to meet the basic criteria or fails during the Qualification Data Package (QDP) submittal or certification testing, a vendor will not be permitted to retest sooner than 30 days after the failure, unless it is determined to be in the best interest of the government.  If the product fails a second time the product will be locked out of future testing for six months after the second failure, unless the government determines it is in TSA’s best interest to allow further testing.  Only offerors who successfully complete testing will be placed on the QPL and be considered for a contract award.  (see attachments for entire announcement)

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for Whole Body Imager (WBI) systems for screening of passengers to be used in our Nation’s airports. The TSA will examine each Offeror’s response to this announcement to determine those vendors who have satisfactorily met the minimum requirements as specified in the white paper requirements section of this announcement. The TSA intends to establish a Qualified Product List (QPL) based on the overall performance of each Offeror’s WBI against TSA specifications and reasonableness of price.  Only Offerors who respond to this announcement and demonstrate compliance to TSA’s requirements, as specified in the TSA WBI Procurement Specification, dated May 2008, will be eligible for placement onto the QPL.  This will be an open QPL, meaning that the Offeror will be able to submit white papers to the contracting officer at any time, although testing will only occur at the discretion of the TSA.  If initial testing finds that the product fails to meet the basic requirements, a vendor will not be permitted to retest sooner than 30 business days after the failure, unless it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  If the product fails a second test, the product will be locked out of future testing for six months, unless the Government determines it is in TSA’s best interest to allow further testing.  Only Offerors who successfully complete testing will be placed on the QPL and be considered for a contract award.

Requirements for the WBI system have been broken into four tiers with progressively increasing levels of requirements.  The vendor has the choice to meet the requirements of the different tiers.  To be added to the QPL, each vendor must meet all Tier I requirements.  A higher-level system must meet all the requirements of the tiers below it.  For example, a Tier III system must meet all Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III requirements.  Potential examples of Tier I requirements include Security Technology Interface Program (STIP), privacy filters, and the ability to scan an individual in the 95th percentile for height.  The tier structure primarily reflects progressively increased requirements for performance to potentially include multiplexing and explosives detection. (see attachments for full announcement)

HPCL Asset Integrity Management Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for an Asset Integrity Management (AIM) project for its petroleum refineries and associated pipelines.

The Grantee, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), is seeking to develop a comprehensive program of Asset Integrity Management (AIM) that it intends to apply at its refineries in India.  This type of program involves world class standards of inspection and maintenance of refinery facilities and pipelines to ensure the uninterrupted, reliable and efficient operation.  This program, which utilizes advanced technologies and methodologies, is vital to minimize the risks and vulnerabilities of large scale petroleum operations, protect the safety of the workforce and neighboring population, and to maximize energy security for India.

The AIM program will draw largely on the experience and advanced technologies developed in the United States in conformity with standards and best practices as developed by the American Petroleum Institute (API), the National Petroleum Refiners Association (NPRA), the Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI), and other organizations.  This is a significant capacity building project that will serve as a template for potential implementation of the program throughout the Indian petroleum sector.  It also will provide an opportunity for a number of advanced U.S. technologies to be demonstrated and is likely to result in significant U.S. inspection services, equipment, and technology exports to India’s refining sector.

The intention of this work is to: (1) assess the prevailing inspection systems and techniques now undertaken by HPCL for asset integrity management; (2) recommend improvements with respect to systems and procedures; (3) recommend new inspection methodologies and technologies that will enhance the safety and the integrity of petroleum refining operations, and will better ensure the reliability of meeting its petroleum products supply obligations to the Indian market, and (4) demonstrate some of these advanced technologies.

HPCL is a major public sector company under India’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.  It is a petroleum refining and oil products marketing company which also has equity in upstream petroleum ventures.  It is a Fortune 500 company (ranks 378) and accounts for roughly ten percent of India’s domestic petroleum refining capacity.  The Government of India holds 51 percent equity, and the remainder is held by other companies, banks, mutual funds, and foreign investors. In addition, the Grantee operates two major refineries producing a wide variety of petroleum fuels & specialties, one in Mumbai (west coast) of 5.5 MMTPA capacity and the other in Vishakapatnam (east coast) with a capacity of 7.5 MMTPA.  The Grantee holds an equity stake of 16.95% in Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Limited, a state-of-the-art refinery at Mangalore with a capacity of 9 MMTPA, and owns and operates the largest lube refinery in the country with a capacity of 335,000 metric tons and accounting for more than 40 percent of the country's total lube base oil production.

The Terms of Reference for this Technical Assistance will include:

Task 1:          Initial project meeting and site surveys
Task 2: 	Training program
Task 3a: 	Pilot risk based inspection implementation
Task 3b: 	Advanced technology field demonstrations
Task 4:	Conduct technical evaluation
Task 5: 	Preliminary environmental impact assessment
Task 6: 	Development impact assessment
Task 7: 	Prepare cost estimates and economic assessment
Task 8: 	Provide list of equipment and technology suppliers
Task 9: 	Training program recommendations
Task 10: 	Deliverables and reporting

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $628,926 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

3) A U.S. company is considered to be under FOCI whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, whether or not exercised, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. company's securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company in a manner which may result in unauthorized access to classified information or may affect adversely the performance of classified contracts.

The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

Note 1:  The rate for Transaction Fees for UGRSA Commodities shall be a rate applicable to completed sales for those commodities whether the unit for the commodity sold is based on bushels or hundredweight.  Once a level is surpassed on a specific transaction fee, the new rate applies to subsequent sales and is not retroactive.  For example, if 25,000 bales of cotton were sold, 20,000 are at the level one rate and 5,000 would be at the level two rate.  This note does not apply to the System Access Fee.

 
Online Marketing Services for Commodities 
U.S. Department of Agriculture
Commodity Credit Corporation



Performance Work Statement
 
C.1.0.  	Background:

C.1.1. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) proposes to contract for online marketing services of CCC-owned commodities.  CCC’s definition of commodities for purposes of this solicitation includes wheat, feed grains (barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, rice, and soybeans), pulse crops (dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, large chickpeas) other oilseeds (canola, crambe, flax, mustard, rapeseed, safflower, sesame, and sunflower), cotton, peanuts, sugar, and dairy products (nonfat dry milk, butter and cheese).

C.1.2. The online marketing service would supplement current CCC sales methods of cataloging, issuing public invitations, and providing sales lists for commodities.  The statutory authority of Section 5 of the CCC Charter Act provides that, “In the Corporation’s purchasing and selling operations with respect to agricultural commodities, the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the fulfillment of the Corporations purposes and the effective and efficient conducts of its business, utilize the usual and customary channels, facilities, and arrangements of trade and commerce, including, at the option of the Corporation, the use of private sector entities.”  Furthermore, P.L. 104-127, Section 165 states, in part, “… The Commodity Credit Corporation may sell any commodity owned or controlled by the Corporation at any price that the Secretary determines will maximize returns to the Corporation.”

C.1.3. CCC is interested in obtaining online marketing services only and has no interest in purchasing or renting any computer hardware or software.  CCC has the sole discretion in making commodities available for sale, which may include the removal of commodities from the online sales platform in order to utilize an alternative sales or disposition method or for any other reason.

C.1.4. The marketing assistance loan programs for most commodities are designed to minimize the potential for loan forfeitures.  Accordingly, there is no guarantee that CCC will acquire any commodities in any given year.  In addition, when CCC does acquire commodities, CCC may choose to dispose of the commodity using a method other than online sales, such as through various food aid programs.  CCC’s current inventory is entirely committed to the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust and may be reviewed at the following website link:  http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/webapp?area=home&subject=coop&topic=pas-sa

C.2.  Scope:  CCC’s objectives are to obtain competitive prices for commodity inventories in the most cost-effective and least market disruptive manner through online marketing services for sales of its commodity inventories.

C.3. Requirements:

C.3.1.   The online marketing service must offer customers the opportunity to negotiate commodity prices, complete sales transactions and, as applicable, complete transfer of title in an electronic format.  The services may include CCC-owned commodities along with other industry owners/marketers of these commodities.

C.3.2.  The online marketing service must provide for:

C.3.2.1. Online access for 10-15 CCC personnel normally engaged in merchandising commodities; 

C.3.2.2. Negotiated flat-price bid sales;

C.3.2.3. Help desk assistance to the users;

C.3.2.4. Inventory sales data in an electronic format; 

C.3.2.5. Daily summary of data on actual sales activities, with a variety of sort options, including reports by commodity and for a particular date, month, fiscal year, calendar year, or date range.  A downloadable spreadsheet format, such as Microsoft Excel, that contains the information is acceptable;

C.3.2.6. Guaranteed sales transactions, so that CCC shall not be subject to losses incurred due to the failure of any subsequent transaction.

C.3.3. Conduct online sales in a dynamic bidding system.  Sales must be guaranteed and payments made to CCC by wire transfer or electronic funds transfer no later than 3:00 p.m. on the next business day following the date of the sale.  CCC will transfer title to the commodity to the contractor no later than the next business day following payment.  CCC may place inventory on the online marketing service, or remove inventory from the online marketing service, at CCC’s sole discretion, at anytime throughout the contract term.  CCC is not obligated to dispose of CCC inventory through the online marketing service.

C.3.3.1. Inventory placed on the service must be made available for sale within 4 hours of receipt.

C.3.3.2. Online services must be available to buyers and sellers at least 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, during normal business hours.

C.3.4. Both buyer and seller identities must be protected.  Until a sale is confirmed, the price determining process must be anonymous.
 
C.3.5. Provide all necessary security safeguards to ensure that market sensitive or proprietary data is secure from disclosure, including the handling of electronic warehouse receipts.
 
C.3.6. Generate necessary inventory sales data to interface with CCC inventory systems.  This data will include the net quantity available for sale for each lot, and grade or other quality factors for the applicable commodity.

C.4. Deliverables:

C.4.1. The contractor shall provide remote access for online marketing service to the Commodity Management Division, Kansas City Commodity Office, and Warehouse and Inventory Division, Washington, DC.
 
C.4.2. Electronic interface requirements necessary to make inventories available to Kansas City Commodity Office.
 
C.4.3. Daily reconciliation of inventory and merchandising activities.
 
C.4.4. All deliverables shall be functional within 10 days of contract award.

C.5. Schedules:   

C.5.1. Performance period is for a base period of one calendar year with four 1-year option periods.

C.6. Miscellaneous:

C.6.1. Government Furnished Property:  USDA will provide warehouse receipt or another applicable data as required from CCC’s inventory catalog for posting to an online service.

C.6.2. Government Points of Contact:  

C.6.2.1. In the Kansas City Commodity Office, the following persons are contacts:  Jerry Cornell, Chief, Commodity Management Division, and Martha Mitchell, Chief, CMD, Merchandising Branch
	
C.6.2.2. In the Warehouse and Inventory Division, Washington, D.C., the following persons
are points of contact:	Mark Overbo, Deputy Director, and Jose Gonzalez, Inventory Program Manager.

C.6.3. Quality Control:  The contractor shall provide a quality control plan describing how the contractor will implement its quality policy.  This plan must describe the responsibilities, procedures, processes, and resources needed to implement quality management.  The plan must also describe what quality audits or reviews will be done.   The contractor shall perform on-going inspections of the work being performed to determine whether results conform to requirements.  The metrics and control limits for cost variances, schedule variances, and defects will be defined in the plan.

<a href="mailto:Heidi.D.Shaw@grc.nasa.gov">Heidi D. Shaw</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for anExtravehicular Activity (EVA) Helmet Mounted Display (HMD).PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS:The purpose of this synopsis is to request information on capabilities of potentialofferors to develop the anticipated HMD as described in the attached "ProposedRequirements for EVA Helmet Mounted Display".  The information received will assist us indetermining if this will be a small business set-aside or a full and open competition. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered by the Government andused for acquisition planning purposes only:BACKGROUND:Current ISS and Shuttle EVA crewmember information displays will not meet the need ofConstellation Program's Extravehicular Activities that will be performed on the Lunarsurface.  Crewmembers will need access to extended information including:  proceduralchecklists, suit status information, caution and warning information, navigational aids,biomedical sensor readings, metabolic rate, and still imagery and video.  TheConstellation Program's next generation of space suits will require the means to displaythe graphical information listed above, ideally using a hands free device, such as anHMD.PROPOSED WORK:NASA Glenn Research Center is anticipating  a 2 phase requirement, with the phasesdescribed as follows:Phase 1:  Development of the optical technologies needed to create a usable, decoupledHMD system.  Phase 1 is the development of a functional model that can be used forlab-based and field-based evaluations of the display concept.  Since the packing of theoptical delivery system is as much a technology driver as optical performance, theinitial phase must be in a form, fit, and function close to that called for in a flightsystem.  Less important in the first phase is packaging and power consumption ofassociated electronics and microdisplay source.  In phase 1, any prototype should havethe ability to be located in multiple places so that display positioning can beevaluated.  As optical performance is key, the goal will be to produce a prototype withoptics that permit Technology Readiness Level (TRL) between 3 and 4, with evaluation in aprototype suit, ideally with the helmet installed and the suit pressurized.  See"Proposed Requirements for EVA Helmet Mounted Display" attached for further Phase 1requirements.Phase 2: Will be an option, and will consist of developing a higher fidelity model withtighter packaging and power constraints using more flight-like materials.  The Phase 2prototype would permit TRL between 5 and 6.  Phase 2 will also be used to improve uponPhase 1 optical parameters that were identified as deficient following the Phase 1evaluation and field-testing.  Note:  Prototype systems will be delivered at the completion of each phase.  Integral toall phases of development is the physical interface with the suit helmet and bubble.HOW TO RESPOND:  The response MUST include the following, and MUST include REFERENCE NUMBER NNC08ZCH020O:1) Company name, address, point of contact, phone, fax, e-mail, and website (ifapplicable).2) Indication of whether your company is a Large business, Small business, SmallDisadvantaged Business, 8(a) Set-aside Small business, HUBZone Small business,Woman-owned Small business, Veteran-owned Small business, HBCU/MI, Service-DisabledVeteran-owned Small business for NAICS code 541712.  The size standard is 500 employees.3) Indication of whether or not your company has a DCAA approved accounting system tosupport a cost type contract. 4) A capability statement of 10 PAGES or less.	 There is no required font size and/ortype designed for this statement.    No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.Technical questions should be directed to:  Michael Lewis at 216-433-6602.Procurement related questions should be directed to: Heidi Shaw at 216-433-5346.Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-typeproduct.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as acommitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemedfully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based onresponses hereto.Responses are requested by:  May 12, 2008.Responses may be sent via the following methods:E-Mail to:  Heidi.D.Shaw@nasa.govFAX:  216-433-2480, Attn:  Heidi D.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) and scheduling an Industry Workshop to fulfill the requirements set forth below.  Acquisition and life cycle cost reduction is a Navy priority for future submarine platforms.  Accordingly, ONR has established the Electric Actuation program under the Enterprise Platform Enablers (EPE) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program to support affordable technology insertions to satisfy this need for submarine control surfaces.  Current controls are hydraulic/mechanical, requiring additional piping systems and ancillary systems that contribute significantly to weight, cost, and maintenance efforts.  ONR is exploring the future role of electric actuation in submarine control surfaces and intends to pursue developments in this area under the EPE/FNC. The objective is to replace today’s legacy control actuation systems with affordable, power dense technology insertions.  Potential benefits include construction and in-service cost reduction through elimination of shipboard hydraulic systems.  Significant challenges include the achievement of a high torque/force density while maintaining stringent requirements for noise and shock tolerance; and, for those portions of the system external to the pressure hull, reliability and long life in a marine environment.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposals, solicitation, or commitment on the part of the Government to issue any future solicitation.  The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request.

<DESC>A sources sought notice is being published by the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (USAINSCOM).<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command anticipates the need to acquire services to support the sustainment of the National Signatures Program (NSP).  The NSP is a joint, multi-agency activity sponsored by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to meet increased customer demands for signature data.  The NSPs overarching goal is to facilitate the access to high-quality signatures to a diverse customer base.  To do this, the NSP leverages the full spectrum of signature related activities (initial collection, processing, development, detailed analysis, and production) within the Department of Defense (DoD), the Intelligence Community (IC), and various other U.S. Government agencies.  The program addresses a host of signature types, including, but not limited to, acoustic, biological, chemical, seismic, radio frequency, infrared, radar, nuclear radiation, electro-optical, and biometrics.  The NSP provides access to signature data on foreign and domestic military and commercial systems such as ground vehicles, fixed and rotary wing aircraft, missiles, munitions, rockets, ships, and submarines, as well as other types of signature data e.g. chemical and biological warfare agents, lasers, and dynamic phenomena (events and activities).<BR><BR>This contracts scope of work includes support to collection efforts, as well as processing, analysis, categorizing, and modeling of measurement and signature data from various sources and targets, and across multiple disciplines worldwide. It also includes database assessment, modification, testing, installation, maintenance, sustainment and upgrades to components of the NSP Application as well as the scientific programs (analytical tools) used to process and/or manage the signature data. This also encompasses efforts to support NSP Signature Organizations and other NSP activities as they relate to measurement and signature processing and analysis, as well as the establishment and sustainment of a system of Signature Organizations operating within the NSP for the generation, management, and utilization of Signature Data within the National Signature Community.  In order to efficiently sustain and modify a high-quality and meaningful data repository system, it is essential for the contract awardee to have working knowledge and expertise in the collection, processing, and analysis of signature data, as well as current expertise in Oracle database design.<BR><BR>Based on the information provided, interested firms are requested to submit a response in the form of a capabilities statement of no more than five (5) pages (on one side, 8  by 11 size paper, 12 point Arial font). The capabilities statement must provide a cover memorandum stating their business size (small or large; if small, provide detail on category, e.g., small women-owned, 8(a), etc. ) and whether they can provide all of the requirements listed in this notice. <BR><BR>A written response is required.  Send the written response postmarked no later than 12 May 2008 to:<BR><BR>HQ USAINSCOM, DIRECTORATE OF CONTRACTING, ATTN: IAPC-DOC (Frances Meckel, Contracting Officer), 8825 Beulah Street, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5246.<BR><BR>The release of this notice in no way obligates INSCOM to release an RFP or make an award of any type.<BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:HERMAN.MCELVEEN@US.ARMY.MIL">Southeast Regional Contracting Office</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil or Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  A.	General Information.<BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of CSR Wraps.      <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is September 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for CSR Wraps product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for CSR Wraps product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.   <BR><BR>Point of Contact:  Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil,  or Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of CSR Wraps, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $198,524.63. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required certifications & documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR> The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of CSR Wraps products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.	At a minimum this includes CSR Wraps that are non-absorbent, with minimal/low lint, provide for a variety of sterilization methods (steam and low temperature sterilization), in a variety of sizes to include but not limited to Regular strength Wraps (sizes 12 x 12, 18 x 18, 24x 24, 30 x 30, 36 x 36, 48 x 48, and 54 x 54); Mid-weight strength Wraps (sizes 18 x 18, 24 x24, 36 x 36, and 54 x 54);  Heavy-duty strength Wraps (sizes 18 x 18, 24 x 24, 30 x 30, 36 x 36,  45 x 45, 48 x 48, and 54 x 54); and Ultra Wraps (sizes 36 x 36, 45 x 45, 48 x 48, and 54 x 54).  <BR>b.	Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>c.	Vendors MUST provide supporting documentation that all CSR Wraps that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved, and provide supporting documentation to support this requirement with the initial submittal.  <BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for CSR Wraps.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors who do not have a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the Southeast Regions prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Southeast Region.  Provide supporting documentation (four digit code) with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)   <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the CSR Wraps products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendor MUST provide Latex free/safe products.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to RFQ with initial submittal.  <BR>8.	Vendor MUST provide CSR Wraps that are non-toxic and have non-fast dyes.  Provide supporting documentation with initial submittal.  <BR>9.	Vendor MUST provide CSR Wraps that are water-resistant or impervious.  Provide supporting documentation with initial submittal.<BR>10.	Vendor MUST provide CSR Wraps that have Minimal/Low lint.  Provide supporting documentation with initial submittal.<BR>11.	Vendor MUST provide products that have a barrier material which is impermeable to liquids and microorganisms.  Provide supporting documentation with initial submittal. <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  <BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-most acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 15 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting.   <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0.<BR>1.	When applying to appropriate items, the sterilization wrap conforms smoothly without stretching or tearing.  <BR>a.	The Wrap must be strong, flexible and remain intact through out the sterilization process for sterility of the package to be maintained.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial for regular strength wrap, mid-   strength wrap, and heavy duty strength wrap; at least one (1) trial for each pouch size in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.	<BR>c.	Each wrap will be applied according to manufactures guidelines, and visually inspected for conformity, stretching and for tears; each pouch will be filled according to manufacture guidelines, and visually inspected for stretching and for tears.<BR>2.	Sterilization wraps resist saturation and any penetration of liquids.<BR>a.	CSR Barrier must effectively resist saturation and /or any liquid penetration to maintain package sterility. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial for all wrap strengths in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The CSR Wrap will be inspected a sterilization process cycle for visual signs of moisture and/or wetness.<BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>(4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. THE CLOSING DATE IS 23 MAY 2008 AT 1600 HOURS (4:00 PM EDT).<BR>

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; THEREFORE PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION BECAUSE NONE EXISTS!</strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE OF INTENT.</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) works to prevent violence before it begins (primary prevention). Prevention requires understanding the factors that influence violence. CDC uses a four-level, social-ecological model (i.e. Prevention Matrix) to better understand violence and the effect of potential prevention strategies. The Prevention Matrix takes into consideration the complex interplay between individual, relationship, community and societal factors. It allows the factors that put people at risk for experiencing or perpetrating violence to be analyzed.</p>
<p>A well coordinated set of tools explaining the concept of primary prevention and the principles that accompany it does not currently exist. Accordingly, DVP has a requirement for the development of an interactive, computerized version of the Prevention Matrix, a tool that helps explain primary prevention and the social-ecological model to DVP grantees and partners.</p>
<p>CDC posted a sources sought synopsis (copy attached) on April 10, 2007 identifying Banyan Communications, Inc. (Banyan) as the only known, responsible source capable of satisfying the requirement to develop the interactive computerized version of the Prevention Matrix using educational theory (Heuristic Engagement). Banyan will use its proprietary software development tool called THEO, a trade marked educational platform developed by Banyan, to develop the interactive computerized version of the Prevention Matrix. THEO uses proven educational theory (Heuristic Engagement). No other source offers THEO.</p>
<p>The CDC responded to one inquiry to the April 10, 2007 synopsis, however, no interested offeror successfully demonstrated a capability to meet the minimum requirements identified in the statement of work (copy attached). Accordingly, the CDC awarded purchase order 200-2007-M-21749 to Banyan dated 7/13/2007 for $643,434.</p>
<p>The CDC requires additional services (see attached modified statement of work) from Banyan and thus intends to negotiate a bi-lateral modification to the purchase order with Banyan for the additional services and extend the period of from September 30, 2008 to September 30, 2009.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on May 9, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. <strong>The capability statement must include an explanation of how the offeror proposes to perform the additional services using the existing web portal designed by Banyan Communications using its proprietary THEO software development tool while ensuring compatibility and meeting the delivery schedule stipulated in the attached statement of work.</strong> A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responses shall be submitted via email to Mr. Lionel Nadeau at: lnadeau@cdc.gov</p>

Description: 	A high-resolution, broadband spectroscopy system has been demonstrated based on fiber-laser frequency combs, whose output forms a comb of lines spanning a wide optical spectrum. The output of a frequency comb is sent through a gas cell. A second phase-locked comb is then mixed with the transmitted comb, to produce a comb of rf heterodyne beat signals. Each rf beat signal provides the relative absorption and phase shift of the gas at a specific wavelength.

<DESC>The United States Department of the Interior ("Government") intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Computer Sites, Inc. of Denver, CO.  This non-competitive action is being issued by the Department of the Interior - National Business Center on behalf of NBC's Information Technology Directorate.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency", and solicited in accordance with FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition.  The Government has a requirement for continued servicing of NBC's Enterprise Service Center ("ESC") in Herndon, VA.
CSI has provided 24/7 monitoring and maintenance of this facility, within a secure environment, under previously competed contracts. Due to personnel changes the contract was allowed to expire. The Government has determined that it is urgent to continue the servicing of this facility. Critical IT systems are housed in this facility and run numerous applications vital to the business of DOI and its customers. Market research indicates that prospective providers of these services would need a formal walk-through and inventory of the facility in order to be able to submit a bid. Indications are that this could take weeks or months to conduct. In the meantime, air conditioning, electrical and other systems are in immediate need of servicing. A delay in procuring these services is deemed unacceptable.
CSI provides 24/7 monitoring of this 3,300 sf facility. The contractor is responsible for servicing and maintaining the generator/automated transfer switch, performing regular maintenance on the air conditioning and electrical systems, performing major servicing of all equipment, including filter and oil changes, lubrication, and ensuring that the emergency fuel system is operational. Numerous other functions are also covered, including UPS maintenance, fire detection system maintenance, etc. 
The Government will conduct a full and open competition for these requirements over the next twelve months. These requirements will be solicited via FedBizOpps. It will be a total small business set-aside. However, there is an immediate need for these services and CSI, as the previous incumbent, has a familiarity with the facility that allows it to commence services immediately
The period of performance for this effort is for one year from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by May 2, 2008. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
Any information submitted in response to this Notice should be sent to the Contracting Officer via email only at: marc _ g _ mackeigan @ nbc.gov.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order to a 100%  capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide a Mass Spectrometer.

The laboratory at the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of Research, Division of Residue Chemistry requires a quadrupole – time-of-flight (Q-TOF) hybrid mass spectrometer to analyze tissues from animals, animal feed, and other matrices for presence or residues of drug, antibiotic, or other xenobiotic compounds.    The NAICS Codes is  334516

The specific need for a Q-TOF configuration is based on the following combination of features:
1.  Accurate mass measurement of molecular ions, to enable molecular composition to be determined by mass assignment;
2.  Accurate mass measurement of product ions obtained by collisions at mass analyzer and the TOF mass analyzer, to enable elemental composition to be determined by a combination of product ion mass assignment and selected  reaction monitoring.

DESCRIPTION:  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this requirement is a 100 percent small business set-aside. 

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a DEEP UV 193nm EXCIMER LASER ABLATION SOLID SAMPLING SYSTEM to be used in the Analytical Chemistry Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

BACKGROUND:

The Inorganic Chemical Metrology Group of the Analytical Chemistry Division (ACD) of the Chemical Sciences and Technology Laboratory (CSTL) of NIST requires a deep UV 193nm Excimer Laser Ablation System (LAS) to allow solid sampling of materials for analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) without the need for sample dissolution. 

This instrument will play a central role in the development and certification of a new series of solid elemental and isotopic Standard Reference Materials (SRM) that will support this rapidly evolving technology.  In spite of their general unsuitability, the NIST SRM 600 glasses are the current defacto standards underpinning this type of analysis and will be replaced by the new standards. 

The LAS will also be used in focused research applications that require spatially specific elemental and isotopic data (e.g. in situ elemental and isotopic measurements within fish otolith zonations; isotopic variations in sea bird egg shells). Laser ablation, as a direct sampling technology, is changing the study of elemental and isotopic variations in very diverse fields of research, from environmental/medical investigations to forensic/geological applications.

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Deep UV 193nm Excimer Laser Ablation Solid Sampling System, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications.

No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. The instrument model offered must have been in full-production for at least 12 months prior to this RFQ with documented sales of the instrument (see Past Experience requirement).

MINIMUM TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Laser Ablation System:

1)	The LAS must be equipped with a deep UV 193nm Excimer laser generated by ArF excitation.  The system must come complete with all gas interconnects and valves.
2)	The pulse width must be less than five (5) nanoseconds at FWMH.
3)	The energy output must be adjustable and controlled by an optical attenuator.  The beam should be homogeneous with a uniform, flat beam profile and an energy distribution within 5 percent, plus or minus.
4)	The short term pulse to pulse stability must be 3 percent or better.
5)	The beam delivery system must be capable of delivering different spot shapes and sizes via software control of masks and attenuators for different modes of analysis.
6)	The entire LAS must be on a mobile instrument platform to facilitate interfacing with different mass spectrometers.

Viewing Optics

7)	The LAS must have a computer controlled color CCD system that can be operated from the mass spectrometer’s computer as well as from a dedicated CPU coupled with the LAS.
8)	The viewing system must be capable of presenting imaged samples in reflected, transmitted and general illumination in plane and cross polarized light.  
9)	The viewing optics must deliver optical magnification capable of resolving features down 
      to 2 micrometers. 
10)	The system must provide real-time sample mapping during ablation.

Sample Chamber

11)	The LAS must be supplied with a high efficiency sample chamber that provides for laminar flow across the sample and efficient particle entrainment.
12)	The sample stage system must accommodate thin sections, thick sections, irregular specimens and standards.
13)	The sample stage must have a 1 micrometer resolution and travel at least 50 mm in the X and Y directions.
14)	The sample chamber and fittings should support the use and control of He carrier gas.

Software

15)	The LAS must be capable of being interfaced with a ThermoFisher Neptune MC-ICPMS, a ThermoFinnigan Element 1 HR-ICPMS and a ThermoElectron X-Series ICP-MS.
16)	The software must be operable on the mass spectrometer computer and monitor with the possibility of bi-directional control between the laser system and the mass spectrometer data collection software.

Line Item 0002:  Installation/Training/Warranty which shall include, at a minimum, the following:

1. The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up and one (1) training session for up to four (4) users at NIST.  Installation, at a minimum, shall include uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of the system, demonstration of all required specifications, and removal of trash. Onsite installation and demonstration shall be done at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

As prescribed at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104–75, insert the following clause: 
Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) Warrants;
(ii) Options;
(iii) Contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) Convertible debt instruments;
(v) Others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

QUESTIONS AND ANSERWS ARE AS FOLLOWS CLIN 0001: (Clarification for the equipment compartment) QUESTION 1: There is no door specified, as such we understand that personnel will not be entering this area. Are we correct in our assumption? Answer: The equipment compartment will only require enough access to allow maintenance personnel to repair and replace chamber mechanical and electrical equipment.  Other than that, personnel will not be entering the equipment compartment.  QUESTION 2: Can you provide the purpose of these air inlets and blower assembly? Answer: The purpose of the air inlets and blower assembly in the equipment compartment is to provide circulation for the compressor cooling fans and other mechanical/electronic components.  The air inlets would also help provide reactivation air to the low air drier should its intake be in the equipment compartment.<BR><BR>

<p>4. Does the Government have a particular aircraft or platform in mind to accomplish this SOW?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>5. If not, would a C-12 be an acceptable aircraft?</p>
<p>All aircraft will be evaluated to determine whether or not they can meet the requirements as set forth in the SOW.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>7. What is the approximate total weight of the sensor payload and<br />related equipment?</p>
<p>About 300lbs total.</p>
<p><br />8. Would operations likely occur at altitudes higher than 28,000 feet MSL?</p>
<p>No. Altitudes for this mission will not require altitudes of greater than 28K.</p>
<p>9. Is the contractor expected to provide the FLIR, EO sensor, LLTV<br />sensor, IR pointer, and FMV?</p>

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Departments networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/IIs BIMC project needs. The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives Systems must have front video/USB ports Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The requested HP server fulfills the following critical requirements: The server must utilize Intels quad-core 5400 series processors that generate no more than 80 watt of heat. The processors shall operate at a minimum of 3.0GHz and employ a 1333 MHz FSB. There are Intel quad-core processors that generate 100 and 120 watts, but they exceed our maximum heat threshold. Note: If Intels 50 watt Quad Core processors are available at the time of purchase, then the 50 watt processor will supersede our original 80 watt requirement, and be the preferred choice. The server form factor must not be greater than 2U The server must support a minimum of (8) internal 2.5 inch SAS hard drives Servers must be configured with 16Gb of memory and have the ability to expand to 32Gb without discarding original memory Server power supplies must be rated by the manufacture at a minimum of 800 watts. The vendor must be able to provide emergency maintenance within a 4-hour response time, 24/7CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that these most closely met the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers server configurations or to manage multiple vendors yearly support and maintenance agreements.The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline. The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>Amended part number in line 10 (HP Carepack)<BR><BR>

<DESC>SANDIA WIND FARM FEASIBILITY PROJECT / FORMING PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE US DOE/NNSA IN THE DELIVERY OF WIND ENERGY TO FEDERAL FACILITITES IN ALBUQUERQUE, NM. / 

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION / 

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT POSTING AGENT D. V. ROSEBOROUGH.   ANY QUESTIONS AND ALL RESPONSES MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO MELLIE R. CANNADY, SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES, CONTRACTING REPRESENTATIVE AT EMAIL ADDRESS: MRCANNA@SANDIA.GOV.  PHONE INQUIRIES CANNOT BE ACCOMMODATED.

Purpose:  Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) to commercial, utility-scale wind farm developers, owners, operators, energy service companies (ESCOs) and financiers who may be interested in forming partnerships with the US DOE/NNSA in the delivery of wind energy to Federal facilities in Albuquerque, NM.
  
This RFI is part of a comprehensive strategy to meet and exceed statutory renewable energy goals for federal agencies; DOE/NNSA is taking a leadership position in accelerating the development of utility-scale wind projects at DOE/NNSA sites that have adequate land with wind resources in Class 3-7 regimes and transmission/distribution capacity.  This RFI seeks responses to issues identified prior to the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the siting, design, installation, operation and maintenance, and delivery of electrical energy of wind farms at an Albuquerque site.  Industry will also have the opportunity to engage in discussions with Sandia prior to this RFI’s response deadline.

DOE/NNSA has conducted an initial screening of all DOE/NNSA facilities and a site at Sandia National Laboratories Albuquerque is one of the areas identified as having the greatest wind farm potential by these initial screening criteria.

DOE/NNSA seeks to facilitate wind farm development and implementation by installing a meteorological (MET) tower for at least 12 months at the potential wind farm site on available land.  Subsequent steps will involve the installation of commercial utility-scale wind turbines at one or more sites.   The wind farm(s) may also serve as a blueprint for other federal agencies seeking to meet EPAct’s renewable energy goals and become a showcase to educate the U.S. public on commercial, utility-scale wind technology.

Background:  Recent legislative policy, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), and Executive Order 13423 Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, and DOE/NNSA Order 430.2B Departmental Energy, Renewable Energy, and Transportation Management have provided impetus for DOE/NNSA to fully assess its own potential to reduce energy consumption and increase the amount of directly-consumed energy from renewable energy resources.  The DOE/NNSA objective is to take a leadership position in meeting the federal renewable energy goals set forth in the EPAct 2005 more quickly than required by law.  Double credit will be given for renewable energy produced on agency sites or on Federal lands and used at a Federal facility; or for renewable energy produced on Native American lands.  Given the costs of available renewable energy technologies and renewable energy resources on DOE/NNSA lands, it is anticipated that utility-scale wind energy may provide the most cost effective approach for DOE/NNSA to meet a significant portion of the EPAct 2005’s renewable energy goal.

SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES / KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE / DOE/NNSA AS A WHOLESALE ELECTRIC CUSTOMER

DOE/NNSA is primarily interested in on-site renewable projects that will be privately owned and operated, with the DOE/NNSA site purchasing the energy through a power purchase agreement (PPA). The Department will consider other project arrangements and is seeking input on approaches to structuring agreements. DOE/NNSA is also in the process of exploring and implementing Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) at most large DOE/NNSA sites. Energy service companies (ESCOs) have been encouraged to evaluate renewables for the proposed ESPC projects. 

As a wholesale electric customer, it is typical to purchase, schedule, take delivery, and to use the spot market for over- and under-utilization of scheduled deliveries.  It is expected that a power block will be competitively purchased of size substantially below the peak demand of the site (72 MW in 2007).  An additional summer block is also expected to be procured with additional small power purchases to meet peaking needs through a Merchant Desk.  Purchasing strategies involve balancing cost while ensuring power is always available to meet the load and power Purchases are based on forecasts and real-time metering.  Excess power can be sold at expected reduced market rates. It is preferred that the wind energy be “firmed” by the developer.  However, other options may be considered and an interface may exist in the forecasting function between wind production and load variability.  

It is anticipated that the energy produced by wind turbines will not exceed the consumption of the federal wholesale customers.  Thus a nominal installation size of 30 MW of wind turbines is expected without consideration of additional energy customers outside of this transaction.      

Issues of consideration:  Sandia seeks to solicit industry input regarding the type of information, data, conditions, resources, contracting mechanisms or parameters, etc. that potential industrial partners would expect/require to be in place in order to respond to a RFP for a wind farm(s) installation and operation on Federal land.  The following issues may be addressed or commented on by the developer responding to the RFI, or may be addressed in the future by the Federal entities involved as wholesale customers, or will be deferred until such time as can be addressed in a future RFP.  Please address these issues with comments on the requirements, needs, or expectations for a successful wind farm installation.   

•	Sandia will install a 50 meter MET tower and a comprehensive wind data set will be made available to all parties interested in the RFP.
•	Sandia will consider requests by interested parties to allow approvals for siting of bidder-supplied MET towers for additional wind assessment.
•	What additional information would a bidder require regarding the wind resource at a particular DOE/NNSA site to be able to respond to an RFP for a wind farm at that site?
•	Maps of electrical plot plans will be made available at the industry day. (see below)  What other information would a bidder need regarding electrical transmission and distribution at the site to be able to respond to an RFP for a wind farm at that site? 
•	Interconnect approval will obviously be necessary for any turbines.  What other information would a bidder need regarding permission for transmission or distribution systems interconnection?  
•	What type(s) of contracting mechanism(s) and terms would a bidder envision in 	   contracting with DOE/NNSA for wind farms at DOE/NNSA sites?  Potential contracting mechanisms for federal agencies include: 
o	Energy Savings Performance Contract 
o	Enhanced Use Lease
o	Power Purchase Agreement 
o	Power Brokering Agreement (see Attachment)
o	Renewable Energy Credits in exchange for lease and royalty payments
o	Other contracting arrangement of interest?
•	What length of contract would a bidder envision for a viable wind farm project?
•	How would the type of contract affect desired length of contract?
•	What is a reasonable time frame for a bidder to develop and implement a wind farm project?
•	Comment on land use issues and the value to be received for land use in return for the energy to be purchased.
•	Comment on Environmental Assessment (EA), Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) requirements and/or processes.  
•	Comment on tax incentives and Renewable Energy Credit (RECs) and the ownership structure needed in terms of contracts to maximize benefits of such incentives.  

Issues of land use will include the rules and regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), coordination needed to avoid possible mission conflict due to other activities on the land or nearby, developer’s approach to contracting activities on base such as project management, safety oversight, escorts, QA inspections, etc.  Nonetheless, Sandia wants to move forward on wind farm development and interact with industry to pro-actively work through issues to achieve satisfactory resolution in a reasonable time frame.  

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST

The purpose of this notice is to obtain from potential industry participants:

1.	An indication of the level of interest  
2.	Suggestions for inclusion in the RFP to attract potential bidders
3.	Types of development planning and support that would be most useful.

<DESC>The primary objectives of the Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST) program are to develop a system that permits exhaustive, accurate, and economical collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping of urban and military environments. The system, which integrates three technical components, will demonstrate materials, packaging, and extraction technologies that sample atmospheric impurities whose concentration ranges from 10 parts per trillion to 100 parts per million by volume from 100 liter-atmospheres of gas in less than five minutes. In the second phase, a complete system that weighs less than one kilogram including power, indexing for one hundred samples, and GPS geolocation will be demonstrated.
