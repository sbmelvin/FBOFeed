<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Test Center (AFTC) at Eglin AFB has a requirement for systems engineering and software engineering support for the development and testing of custom software for the automated control of full-scale and sub-scale aerial targets as part of the Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS). The GRDCS is used to control drones, control ground vehicles, collect and display time space position information data for aircraft and surface vehicles, and control aircraft instrumentation. Software engineering support will be required in the areas of system programming, drone control software, calibration, graphics, navigation, and post mission data reduction. Systems engineering support will be required in the areas of systems software design, drone control algorithms, navigation algorithms, data analysis, test planning, and documentation. The QF-4, MQM-107D, MQM-107E, BQM-34A, and the BQM-167A automatic flight controls have already been integrated into GRDCS. The QF-16 automatic flight control shall soon be integrated into GRDCS. GRDCS support shall be provided by the contractor at the Central Control Facility at Eglin AFB, FL; however, support may be required at Tyndall AFB, FL, White Sands Missile Range, NM or the Utah Test and Training Range or other locations within the CONUS.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Government anticipates a single contract award with a maximum 3 Year and 45 Day Period of Performance (if all options are exercised) consisting of a 45 Day Transition Period, a Base Year plus Two 1 Year Option periods. Full and open competitive procedures and FAR 15.101-2 Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process will be utilized. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. The associated Small Business Size Standard for NAICS 541712 is 500 employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Government anticipates utilizing a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract type for the 45 Day Transition, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) (Term) contract type for Labor, and Cost Reimbursable (no fee) contract type for Travel. Data is Not Separately Priced. The request for proposal (i.e. solicitation) is expected to be released on FebBizOpps.gov in mid-December. Contract award is anticipated in December 2013 and will contain a transition period of 45 days with full contract performance starting in January 2014.<br /><br />This solicitation is the resolicitation of FA9201-12-R-0007. Please note that the evaluation criteria is being revised to place a limit on the ability of an offeror to enter exclusive arrangements with members of the incumbent's workforce. We expect this limitation will (1) encourage competition while (2) allowing offerors to enter agreements that restrict an incumbent employee's ability to participate in proposal preparation with more than one offeror. We expect this limitation will enable each employee to sign multiple letters of intent. <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to access future information on this acquisition via the FedBizOpps.gov website (i.e. www.fbo.gov). Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to Leslie Bax, Contract Specialist, via email at leslie.bax@eglin.af.mil or via telephone at 850-882-0159. The Contracting Officer, John Nalezny, may be contacted at email john.nalezny@eglin.af.mil or telephone 850-882-2675. Collect calls will not be accepted. Foreign participation is not permitted.</p>

An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK Introduction: Support is requested to provide a portable neutrino detector, perform experiments to determine the effect of reactor-produced neutrinos on decay rates of multiple, specific isotopes; and investigate the correlation between solar flares and nuclear decay rates of specific isotopes using data from multiple experiments.
Background:
A number of scientific groups have recently reported unexpected variations in nuclear decay rates, which appear to be linked to a solar influence.  These observations include a change in the decay rate of 54Mn during a solar flare, and periodicities observed in various decays including 3H, 32Si, 36Cl, 56Mn , 60Co, 90Sr, 137 Cs, 152Eu, 222Rn (and/or its daughters), and 226Ra (and/or its daughters).  The indication of a solar influence leads to the suggestion that solar neutrinos may be responsible for the observed effects, and this influence is being tested in a number of laboratories in the United States and abroad
The indication that nuclear decay rates can be affected by neutrinos has a number of significant practical implications, and the contractor selected will explore three of these: (a) If at least some isotopes do respond to solar neutrinos, this implies that radioactive nuclei can act as sensitive small scale neutrino detectors capable of monitoring nuclear reactors here or abroad.  (b) Additionally, this phenomenon could be used to accelerate the decay of some nuclear waste by exposing the waste to an appropriate neutrino source.  (c) Finally, the observation of a change in decay rate coincident with a solar flare, has significant implications for predicting the arrival of a solar flare.  This would enable, for the first time, the capability of preventing damage to the nation?s power grid and communications systems including satellites, by providing approximately 24 hours of advanced warning of an impending solar storm and resultant current surge.
Scope of Work: The Contractor will provide a portable neutrino detector.  They shall perform experiments to determine the effect of reactor-produced neutrinos on decay rates of multiple, specific isotopes. The contractor will also investigate the correlation between solar flares and nuclear decay rates of specific isotopes using data from multiple experiments. The scope of work includes that the contractor will provide all labor, material, and other resources necessary to successfully accomplish this work.  The selected vendor will be responsible for the design, assembly, testing, conducting of experiments, and analysis of results.  Each stage of the project will require approval from DOE management before moving on to the next stage.  The selected contractor must ensure it has adequate resources for accomplishing this work.  Specific deliverables and milestones are listed below in this Statement of Work. &#8195; Required Skills/Expertise 
The selected contractor shall have scientific and technical experience with neutrino detectors (including design, assembly and test, and analysis), and the impact of neutrinos on the decay of radioactive isotopes, experience with the science of the solar creation of neutrinos, and with the handling of and detectors of unstable radioactive isotopes. Also, the contractor will need to have experience in decay counting appropriate to determining half-lives.
Security Considerations:
Contractor personnel will need to be able to gain access to government reactor sites such as the Advanced Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Research Reactor in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
Environmental, Safety and Health Considerations:
The person will be handling radioactive isotopes, so the contractor will need the proper equipment to get access and handle safely the appropriate isotopes. The contractor shall provide a completed environmental checklist with their proposal. Export Control The contractor will be required to comply with export control laws due to any export control issues that arise from the work performed. Quality Assurance/Control The contractor should maintain monthly contact (for example, through mutually agreed times for video conference calls) with the point of contact within the Office of Nuclear Energy.  QA shall be adequate to rule out non-neutrino influences on detectors such as: temperature, gamma rays, neutrons, voltage, vibration, and magnetic and electric fields.
Intellectual Property It is DOE?s intent to award this contract to a small business.  Consistent with the Bayh-Dole Act, 37 CFR 401.14(a)(b) Allocation of Principle Rights, the small business contractor awarded this work will retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world in the subject invention. Period of Performance: The period of performance is from January 1, 2013 through March 31, 2013.  All work must be completed within this timeframe. &#8195; Travel/Work Location: The selected contractor will perform a majority of the work at its own facility. The contractor will be required to have a monthly conference call with DOE project management personnel (day and time TBD) for a status meeting; the monthly status meeting will include project progress and status, project financial status and burn rates, and a discussion of any issues, including delays or problems.  Additionally, DOE project management personnel may visit the contractor?s facility for reviews.  The contractor will provide and arrange for meeting spaces within its facility for all required meetings. As discussed in the Statement of Work Effort section below, major task 4 states the contractor will travel to up to three reactors to test the neutrino detector?s ability to detect impact of neutrinos on the decay rates of various radioisotopes. The reactor must have sufficient neutrino flux to test the hypothesis that neutrinos affect radioisotope decay rates.  Potential reactors include the Advanced Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Research Reactor in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and one university reactor (1 to 2 MW size).  This travel will include transporting the neutrino detector.  Each trip will be three to ten days long.
Technical Point of Contact:
The DOE-ID technical point of contact will be:
Cliff Fineman Nuclear Engineer, DOE-ID 208-526-2753 or finemacp@id.doe.gov
Statement of Work Effort:
The contractor will be responsible for performing all required tasks throughout the various stages of this project.  The following is a list of major tasks that will result in the successful completion of this project: 1)	Kickoff: ?	The contractor will create and present a project plan.  The plan should address project schedule, design, detector assembly, test, implementation/experiment, documentation/data completion, and transition of data to the Government.   ?	The contractor will present its project plan to DOE for review and approval within 1 week after contract award.  ?	DOE review of the plan, along with authorization to proceed, is anticipated to be provided within 1 week after contractor submission of the plan.    ?	Work efforts, including design, detector assembly, test, and implementation/experiment, documentation/data completion and transition of data phases shall adhere to the approved schedule. 2)	Design Phase: ?	The contractor will work with DOE to gather and establish detailed requirements. These include but are not limited to:  o	The detector must be capable of detecting neutrinos emitted from reactors or other similar sources in order to test the hypothesis that reactor neutrinos will perturb nuclear decay rates based on approved requirements. o	The detector shall be based on the use of exempt sources for the radioactive isotopes tested.  If the detector cannot be designed using exempt sources, the contractor is responsible for obtaining the necessary NRC license and security clearances, training personnel, etc. o	The detector shall accommodate the changing of the exempt source so a single detector can be used to test a variety of isotopes. o	The detector shall be portable. o	The detector shall include hardware for measuring the decay rates of the isotopes o	The detector will include software and algorithms that will look for unexpected deviations in the decay rates of the isotopes when exposed to neutrino flux. ?	The contractor will submit the design proposal for DOE review and approval.  Presentation to DOE of the proposed design for DOE review and approval will take place by conference call and web-based presentation or video conference call. 3)	Assembly/Test Phase: ?	The contractor will only build the detector after the DOE-HQ TM approves the design.  Upon receiving DOE approval to proceed, the contractor will build the detector to the DOE approved design in order to test the hypothesis that reactor neutrinos will perturb nuclear decay rates. ?	The contractor will provide DOE with a testing plan for the detector. ?	Upon receiving DOE approval of the testing plan, the contractor will conduct testing and provide DOE with test verification results that ensure the device is built correctly per the design, is in working order, and is ready to be used in performing experiments.  ?	The contractor will provide DOE with a written test report for DOE review and approval.  Presentation to DOE of the of as-built detector and the test report for DOE review and approval will take place by conference call and web-based presentation or video conference call. 4)	Implementation/Experiment Phase. ?	Upon receipt of DOE approval to proceed, the contractor will implement the experiments using the detector.  The detector will use multiple isotopes to test the hypothesis.  ?	Contractor will perform experiments in the proximity of a reactor whose neutrino flux has intensity similar to that of solar neutrinos impinging on the earth.  The reactor will be switched on and off multiple times over several days to determine whether the modulation in neutrino intensity is observable by the experimental apparatus. ?	Contractor will perform experiments on multiple isotopes in a laboratory environment to determine which isotopes are more sensitive to solar annual periodicities with a view toward determining the extent to which decay rates can be modified by exposure to neutrinos emanating from the sun.
5)	Contractor will examine solar flare occurrences to determine the extent to which they are correlated to perturbations of nuclear decay rates.  Multiple instances of decay data will be analyzed to verify the correlation is valid. 
6)	The contractor will document all experiments and results, including providing an analysis of these and providing this information to DOE in the form of a complete report for DOE review and approval.  Because this is a government funded project, all results will be available to the public.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.&nbsp; A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</strong>
<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Media Barn, Inc., 2200 Clarendon Blvd, Suite 1200, Arlington, VA 22201-3331, to provide a continuation of services to the NHLBI Office of Communications, in the completion of two critical Web content strategy projects.</p>
<p>This is a Follow-On Requirement.&nbsp; The sole source determination is based on the fact that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Communications provides a comprehensive, integrated, and technology-supported communications capability for all matters relating to the communication of the Institute's vision, Strategic Plan, and mission oriented program activities and accomplishments to internal and external audience; initiates, develops, and implements a dynamic, proactive, audience-centric communications program; mission-oriented; involves multiple groups on a national and international level and leverages the communications resources of local, national, and international sources, including interest groups; evaluates the effectiveness of communications activities; and coordinates and integrates activities of the Public Affairs and the Health Campaigns &amp; Consumer Services Branches.&nbsp; This project supports the continued implementation of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) digital strategy, which covers over 10,000 pages of digital content across hundreds of web sites that include NHLBI's core web site and all of the campaigns and various micro websites.</p>
<p>Media Barn, Inc. and the NHLBI have collaborated for almost 2 years on the Web content strategy projects.&nbsp; During this timeframe, Media Barn has provided user interface design services to develop a new content structure and new page level interfaces that support the future of NHLBI's digital communications strategy.&nbsp; In order to complete the project within the required timeline, and in conformance with NHLBI specifications, it is essential for Media Barn to complete the current and future state analysis and wire framing of the clinical trials awareness/education content, as well as the user interface design for intramural research content strategy. <br /><br />Media Barn has a deep knowledge base and understanding of the NHLBI's mission, how the digital strategy supports the Institute's mission and the Office of Communications' multi-phased, multi-platform approach for implementing the digital strategy.&nbsp; In addition, they have invested time to establish the foundation of this project and to acquire the level of expertise required to support the NHLBI's specific needs.</p>
<p>During the course of the work with the NHLBI, Media Barn has developed a detailed understanding of the breadth and complexity of the content of the Institute's Web pages.&nbsp; Media Barn has an understanding of the NHLBI's desired future content and page structures and the relationships between the NHLBI's content, audience needs, and business requirements.&nbsp; This in-depth understanding is a skill that is not readily available from other sources in the general marketplace.&nbsp; Moreover, retraining a new contractor to the level of the proposed contractor's abilities would require the project team to halt its work for a considerable amount of time and then start over with implementation of the project.&nbsp; This will result in the loss of more than a year's work and time spent in building the proposed contractor's knowledge and expertise, as well as the progress made to date on the project.&nbsp; In addition, it would not be possible for a new contractor to complete the project deliverables within the required timeline, which is critical to maintain, as it would cause a significant delay and interruption in the project.</p>
<p>Only by retaining the services of the proposed contractor, Media Barn, can the NHLBI avoid timely and costly delays in the completion of the two critical Web content strategy projects.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Requirements</span>:<br />The scope of the project includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Complete a Web content analysis for the NHLBI's intramural research content;<br />2.&nbsp; Conduct a Web content analysis of clinical trials communications and education to patients and health professionals;<br />3.&nbsp; Provide user interface design services in support of future clinical trial communications strategy;<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop Web concept mock ups and user interface wireframes for the NHLBI's Division of Intramural Research content;<br />5.&nbsp; Develop Web concept mock ups and user interface wireframes for clinical trials; and<br />6.&nbsp; Serve as the content strategy liaison for the NHLBI Office of Communications with NHLBI cross-functional teams to provide NHLBI-specific, as well as industry-wide expertise related to Web content analysis and its relationship to user experience to support the implementation of the Institute's digital strategy.<br /><br />The estimated level of effort for this requirement is not expected to exceed 700 hours during the period of performance, beginning from the date of award and for approximately six (6) months, for an average of 24 hours per week.</p>
<p>The total estimated amount of this purchase order is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541512, Computer Systems Design Services, with a size standard of $25.5 million.&nbsp; The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures; therefore, the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competition Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001), and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-62 (November 20, 2012).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.&nbsp; Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by December 4, 2012, 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.&nbsp; The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.

The desired occupancy date is 30Apr13. <br>  <br> Office facilities are to be operated by MEDCOM to meet the immediate needs of their mission.  This office is to be located in a defined geographical area that contains businesses and other establishments that are of a compatible nature.   <br>  <br> The tenant shall, on an occasional basis, have the right to use the space beyond normal working hours and, if required, on Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays.  This includes the use of elevators, lights, toilet facilities, and, if necessary, heating and air conditioning.  <br>  <br> GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: <br>  <br> A.  The offer to lease should include the following: <br>  <br>     1.  Itemized rental proposal worksheet. A flat rental rate for the entire six-year term is preferred. <br> 2.

An estimate of the number of calendar days to complete the finish-out of the space after award of the lease. <br> 4.  A copy of the legal description of the property. <br> 5.  Proof of ownership. <br>  <br> B.  The offer must be inclusive of the following: <br>                         <br> 1.  Interior and exterior maintenance (including plumbing, electrical fixtures, HVAC maintenance, signage maintenance, door locks, fire extinguisher maintenance, pest control, and other minor repairs). <br> 2.  Tenant improvements in accordance with our Construction Specifications and the proposed floor plan.    <br> 3.  All real estate taxes and insurance premiums with respect to the leased premises. <br> 4.  Common area maintenance. <br> 5.  Water, sewer, and trash removal services. <br> 6.

The Government requests the Lessor pay in full, or in part, the cost of improvements, alterations, or other finish-out.  The Government will pay any remaining balance as a one-time, lump sum figure following completion of work and acceptance of the space. Lessor/Offeror should obtain bids from at least three qualified contractors and an itemized listing of finish-out charges must be submitted on the Notice to Prospective Bidder format or a similar computer-generated facsimile of this format.  Government appraisers will review bids. <br>  <br> 1.  The Tenant Improvement Allowance is $10.00 per ANSI/BOMA Office Area square foot.  (Tenant improvements are the finishes and fixtures that typically take space from the  quote mark shell quote mark  condition to a finished, usable condition.)  The Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be used for the build-out of the Government-demised area in accordance with the Government-approved design intent drawings.  All Tenant Improvements required by the Government for occupancy shall be performed by the successful Offeror as part of the rental consideration, and all improvements shall meet the quality standards and requirements of this solicitation and its attachments. <br>  <br> 2.  The Tenant Improvement Allowance shall include all the Offeror's administrative costs, general contractor fees, subcontractor's profit and overhead costs, Offeror's profit and overhead, design costs, and other associated project fees necessary to prepare construction documents and to complete the tenant improvements. It is the successful Offeror's responsibility to prepare all documentation (working/construction drawings, etc.) required to receive construction permits. NO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILDING SHELL SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE TENANT IMPROVEMENT PRICING. <br>  <br>  <br> 3.  The Government, at its sole discretion, shall make all decisions as to the usage of the Tenant Improvement Allowance. The Government may use all or part of the Tenant Improvement Allowance. The Government may return to the Lessor any unused portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance in exchange for a decrease in rent according to the amortization rate over the firm term.  <br>  <br> a. The Government reserves the right to make cash payments for any or all work performed by the Lessor. Prior to occupancy, the Government, at its sole discretion, may choose to pay lump sum for any or all of the Tenant Improvement Allowance. If, prior to occupancy, the Government elects to make a lump sum payment for any portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance, the payment of the Tenant Improvement Allowance by the Government will result in a decrease in the rent. At any time after occupancy and during the firm term of the lease, the Government, at its sole discretion, may choose to pay lump sum for any part or all of the remaining unpaid amortized balance of the Tenant Improvement Allowance if the original occupant agency vacates the space. If the Government elects to make a lump sum payment for the Tenant Improvement Allowance after occupancy, the payment of the Tenant Improvement Allowance by the Government will result in a decrease in the rent according to the amortization rate over the firm term of the lease.  <br>  <br> b. If it is anticipated that the Government will spend more than the allowance identified above, the Government reserves the right to either 1) reduce the Tenant Improvement requirements, 2) pay lump sum for the overage upon completion and acceptance of the improvements, or 3) increase the rent according to the negotiated amortization rate over the firm term of the lease.  <br>  <br> c. Payment will not be made by the Government in instances where the Government accepts fixtures and/or other Tenant Improvements already in place. However, the Lessor will be reimbursed for costs to repair or improve the fixture(s) and/or any other improvements already in place.  <br>  <br> D.  	Offeror is requested to waive restoration of tenant improvements installed under the terms of the lease. <br>  <br> E.	Offeror shall state the number of days after award required to complete the finish-out of the space. <br>  <br> F.	Offer must be signed by the same individual who is authorized to sign the lease. <br>  <br> G.	Lessor/Offeror must complete GSA Form 3518, Representations and Certifications. The Offeror must obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number obtained from Dun & Bradstreet and also must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the time of submission of offer.

In accordance with Public Law 104-134 (10 USC 3332) all payments made by the Government must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) into an account of the Lessor's choosing.  Please note that the address in the first section of the EFT form must be the same as the address contained in paragraph 3 of the sample lease. <br>  <br> I.  As required by Army Regulation AR 200-2, the Government must obtain information concerning the past use of the lease site.  The Preliminary Assessment Screening form (Enclosure 11) is provided to help you assist us on this issue.   <br>  <br> J.  Prior to final acceptance and execution of the lease by the Government, in accordance with public law, either a Government-employed or contracted appraiser must complete a fair market rental value appraisal report.  The purpose of this report is to demonstrate and prove that the rental and any other consideration paid by the Government for the leased space is consistent with the rentals and other amounts paid by other tenants of the Lessor, if any, who lease similar size and quality of space.  By submitting this offer, the Lessor agrees to cooperate with the appraiser by providing information on recent leases on a comparable form.  Information that is provided by the Lessor will be kept confidential. <br>  <br> K.  Location:  Space within a 3 mile radius of the intersection of Scott Road and Schofield Road, Fort Sam Houston, TX will be given priority.  Space in existing buildings will be given primary consideration.  Built-to-Lease proposals will only be considered if existing buildings are not available or suitable.

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />Background<br />In 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) was enacted into law. Section 1013 of MMA authorizes AHRQ to conduct research, demonstrations, and evaluations designed to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The essential goals of the Section 1013 mandate are to develop valid evidence, and make it easily accessible to decision makers, about the comparative effectiveness of different treatments and appropriate clinical approaches to an array of health problems. Achieving these goals will encompass reviewing, synthesizing, and translating published and unpublished scientific evidence, as well as identifying important issues for which existing scientific evidence is insufficient for making adequate decisions about health care. To fulfill its mandate, AHRQ established the Effective Health Care (EHC) Program, the primary purpose of which is to develop research to inform the health care decisions of patients, consumers, providers and policymakers among others. A description of the EHC Program is available on the web site (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov).<br />The EHC Program consists of three primary components, each with a unique, yet interacting purpose. One component conducts syntheses of scientific evidence, another generates new scientific evidence and analytic tools, and the third component, the "John M. Eisenberg Clinical Decisions and Communications Sciences Center" translates scientific findings for various audiences. <br />The Eisenberg Center was created in 2005 and is a multi-disciplinary center that translates and disseminates the scientific information resulting from evidence synthesis or evidence generation activities into a form which is readily understandable and can be incorporated into decision making for various audiences, namely consumers, patients, providers and policy makers. Leveraging their unique skills, the Eisenberg Center assumes as their primary responsibility and objective to help end users understand complex scientific information, issues of balancing harms and benefits, numeracy and literacy issues, and cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The objective of the potential requirement will be to continue the established mission of the Eisenberg Center, i.e., facilitate access to and use of evidence-based clinical and health care delivery information and foster informed health care decisions by patients, providers and policymakers among others. The collective activities of the EC are intended to achieve the following objectives:<br />1. Increase awareness, access (cognitive and physical) and use of the EHC program research findings, its products, and activities.<br />&bull; Develop high quality translation and dissemination products that distill and interpret evidence synthesis and research findings for various audiences that can be used to inform health care decisions. <br />&bull; develop products and/or messages that can be adapted by others and integrated into their products or systems<br />&bull; Products tested with potential stakeholders to ensure understanding and intended options and action(s)<br />2. Facilitate program transparency and public engagement by maintaining the EHC web site which serves as the "public face" of the program<br />&bull; Conduct timely postings of products <br />&bull; Disseminate effective announcements inviting public comment and participation in activities<br />3. Increase the knowledge base in decision and communications science, and other relevant areas to inform decision making of multiple audiences (contribute to the state of the science)<br />&bull; Identify knowledge gaps in the translation and use of evidence by decision makers<br />&bull; Produce concept papers that address the knowledge gaps and other identified issues</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />Please be mindful that while there are IT components in this project, this is NOT and IT requirement. The project will be content-driven, supported by information technology.<br />There are eight (8) major tasks for this project, each having specific requirements and deliverables:</p>

KBSC trains Korea, Japan, Pacific region, and CONUS based (when required) personnel to use Army Mission Command Systems; manages constructive simulation training resources; and contributes to theater engagement strategy. <br>  <br> 1.4.1. Korea Battle Simulation Center (KBSC)is a field operating agency assigned to US Army Pacific (USARPAC) under the operational control of CFC/USFK CJ3.  The KBSC, located in the Walker Center at Yongsan Army Garrison, Seoul Korea, is the  quote mark hub quote mark  for simulation driven exercises at the division level and higher using constructive simulation federations.  .  For the purpose of Eighth Army exercises, the KBSC responds to the Eighth Army G3.  For all other exercises, the KBSC responds to the supported commander or exercise director. <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1..  Background Information.  The Korea Battle Simulation Center (KBSC) was established by US Forces Korea/Eighth US Army (USFK/8A) in September of 1991.  It provides Combined Forces Command (CFC)/US Forces Korea (USFK)/Eighth Army (8A)/ US Army Pacific/US ArmyJapan, the commanders and staffs, their components and major subordinate commands, the ROK Armed Forces, and others with cost effective training alternatives to restrictions imposed by the increased complexity and ranges of current and emerging weapons systems, as well as limited maneuver areas, OPTEMPO, and training dollars.  CFC will undergo Operational Control Transition from US led to ROK led-US supported during this contract period. The contractor shall be required to fully support this transition effort in the performance of this contract.  Included in this transition will be physical move of KBSC from its current location to Camp Humphreys. <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1..  KBSC Missions. <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1.1..  Conduct CFC theater level simulation-driven exercises  <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1..2.  Support 8A and 2nd Infantry Division Exercises <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1..3.  Serve as US Army Pacific Regional Simulation Center (RSC)  <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1.4.  Provide simulation support to US Army Japan (USARJ). <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1.5.  Support the US Army Mission Command Training Program (MCTP). <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1..6.  Serve as executive agent for the Eighth Army Certification Exercise (CERTEX) program. <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1..7.  Assist ROK Armed Forces in the use of simulations in training  <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.1..8.  Other exercises, training, test and fielding events.  <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.2.  Purpose and Operating Philosophy.  <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.2.1.   The KBSC exists to enhance the readiness of the ROK/US Combined Forces Command; United States Forces, Korea; Eighth Army, US Army Pacific; and other selected US and allied military organizations.  The KBSC facilitates the training of these organizations by supporting the conduct of combined, joint, and service exercises from the theater through the small unit level.  Normally they are simulation-driven Command Post Exercises (CPXs).  However, they may be scripted CPXs, Field Training Exercises (FTXs), Mission Rehearsal Exercises (MRX), Combined Counter-Fire Exercises (CCX), or combinations thereof involving the use ofL-V-C-G technology. The mission is dynamic - short notice exercise-related taskings are the norm. <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.2.2.  The KBSC is a service organization devoted to satisfying the customer (the training audience) by providing a high quality product (realistic, stressful, first-rate exercises).  It provides the full spectrum training environment from individual through battle staff training and a total immersion in war fighting for Mission Command Leader Training.   <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.2.3.  The KBSC approach to training through exercise planning and execution is characterized by the tenets of major combat  operations.  Careful attention is paid to clearly defining for each exercise the training audience, training objectives, and resources available to conduct the exercise.  Maximum efficiency and effectiveness are assured through the use of comprehensive and deliberate planning and preparation. <br>  <br> 1.4.1.1.2.4.  In general, exercises are taken to the training audience . . . not the reverse.  Whenever dictated by the needs of an exercise, simulations will be distributed to remote sites.  The KBSC is manned, equipped, and attuned to conducting bare-base, remote operations. <br>  <br> 1.4.1.2. Warrior Mission Planning and Rehearsal Complex (WMPRC) ,  located at Camp Casey, Dongduchon, Republic of Korea provides realistic maneuver training to Battalions, Brigades, and Mission Rehearsal Exercises (MRX). Primary simulation federations used are the Joint Live Virtual Constructive (JLVC) Federation and/or Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability - Entity Resolution Federation (JLCCTC-ERF).  In coordination with Training Support Activity Korea (TSAK), virtual simulators and gaming models are used to support  live, virtual, constructive (LVC) exercises.  The KBSC wide area network provides the Live Virtual Constructive-Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) to conduct these exercises.  <br>  <br> 1.4.2.  The use of simulations as a training tool for commanders at theater level and below is under a constant state of change.   This requires innovative thinking and dynamic procedures to employ them in a manner that provides supported commanders and staff a realistic view of the modern battlefield.  Simulations place the command and control elements of the training audience in an environment that stresses decision-making, coordination, and staff interaction. Role players located in simulation centers, communicate with the training audience via organic communication links. In some cases, computer simulations feed data directly to the mission command systems of the training audience. Contractors assume multiple roles in assisting participants during the conduct of a simulation exercise.  <br>  <br>  <br> 1.5.  Period of Performance. The period of performance will be from 1 June 2013 to 30 May  inclusive of 30 days phase-in period with four (4) one-year option periods. <br>  <br> 1.6.  General Information. <br>  <br> 1.6.1.  Hours of Operation.  <br>  <br> 1.6.1.1.  Normal Hours.

The contractor must at all times maintain sufficient workforce for the uninterrupted performance of all tasks defined within this PWS when the Government facility is not closed for the above reasons.   Normal work hours may be modified by the Government at any time in order to meet critical missions. <br>  <br> 1.6.1.2.  Exercise Hours.  Exercise hours are based on exercise objectives and are established for each exercise on a case-by-case basis.  The length of exercises will vary in duration ranging from a single day event to several days or weeks.  Exercises will occur on Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal Holidays.  The contractor shall provide exercise support with 24-hour operations with 12-hour shifts, seven days a week.   The contractor shall be responsible to adjust personnel work schedules to mitigate the need for overtime in support of exercises.  <br>  <br>  <br> 1.6.2.  Security Requirements. <br>  <br> 1.6.2.1.

<DESC>Overview
The Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for the operation of a water-salvage program within the Closed Basin Project.  This water salvage program is administered by Reclamation's Alamosa Field Division (AFD) in Alamosa, Colorado.  This is a request for information regarding what your laboratory would charge to undertake and perform the designated water-quality sampling and monitoring program, associated with these water-salvage operations.  This program also provides biological and chemical technical support for the operation and maintenance of the Project wells.  Your participation is completely discretionary.  This is not a request for a proposal, but merely a request for information. Essentially, this is a market research tool.  Nevertheless, diligence and accuracy is requested if you choose to answer this request for information.
The Closed Basin Project lies along an approximate 45-mile-long arc within the north-central portion of the San Luis Valley in Colorado.  The Project, covering 125,000 acres, is just west of the Great Sand Dunes National Monument and the southernmost end of the project lies just east of Alamosa.  Elevations on the valley floor approach 7600 ft above sea level.  Weather conditions in the project area vary from mild summers with daytime temperatures in the 70s, to harshly cold and snowy, windy winters with temperatures ranging as low as -20 to -40?F from November to February.  Field work with water-quality sampling given these considerations will have to reasonably accommodate continuity of the sampling program without sacrificing that continuity due to weather conditions or other difficulties.
The water-salvage program of the Project currently operates an array of 170 salvage wells (see Figure 1).  This array is bounded into four stages, each stage covering about one-fourth of the project area.  The wells within this array collectively discharge through a segmented total of approximately 115 miles of pipeline laterals.  This lateral collection system then discharges into a 42-mile-long conveyance channel that stretches along the length of the Project.  The conveyance channel, in turn, discharges into the Rio Grande within the Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge, southeast of Alamosa.  Water quality of the Rio Grande receiving salvage water at this discharge location is monitored and maintained to meet, or exceed water-quality standards that are integral to the Rio Grande Compact.  Threats to production include available water and physical plugging due to iron related bacteria, sand and mineral scale.  The AFD currently has a rehabilitation-and-drilling program in place to help mitigate such issues.
Attachment A provides the required analyte assessment suite for the program.  As noted in Attachment B, the water quality sampling program is divided into four Analysis Order Study Groups.  Each level of water quality sampling is addressed by the specifications given within the study group for which that aspect of the sampling is assigned.  The number of samples within the water sampling program, and group sampling schedule, and cost assessment request, is also specified in Attachment B.  Please note, if you do not wish to indicate the specifics regarding cost for personnel, mobilization, and overhead, that are indicated in Attachment B, then please indicate the total cost that would be estimated for each task.  We are also asking for the cost regarding each analysis study group, and total costs for all samples.  Please carefully review Attachment B.
To summarize, this is a request for information only regarding the cost that would be likely charged if your firm were asked to perform the water quality sampling program for the Closed Basin Project.  All of the specifics regarding tasks for the work you are being asked to cost evaluate, are given below.
Task specifications, deliverables, and cost-evaluation queries  
The water-quality monitoring and support program will consist of the following tasks:
1.	Each of the 170 salvage wells must be sampled for a complete set of water quality analyses at least 2 times per year.  Given specific considerations regarding water-quality monitoring, more frequent sampling may be required.  Such additional sampling would be an indefinite quantity in this informational request.  Confined Space Training and Entry Certification is also required (See section 2 below). 
When sampling for each well is performed, water-quality sampling will be completed on a rotation schedule so that each well will eventually be sampled during every calendar month of the year over a recurrent cycle that will repeat every 6 years.  Sampling will require coordination with AFD Operations Group to verify that wells to be sampled are operating and running at least 24 hours prior to sampling. Coordination by the contractor with the AFD staff is required to adjust valves, which is critical to sampling and overall operations to obtain adequate pressure at the sampling point at the well site.  Sites without valve control will require contractor field personnel to be trained regarding manual adjustment of the valves, or will require coordinated on-site assistance from a member of the AFD Operations group.  Proper valve adjustment must be made to ensure the well functions correctly prior to, during, and after sampling. The following deliverables are required for this portion of the water-quality monitoring program:
     a)	 For each of the 170 salvage wells, sampling is performed 2 times per year for each well. The expected total number of samples for this part of the water-quality monitoring program is 340 samples.        b)	Sampling performed at each well will require a sampling report regarding the sampling suite that is directed, as shown in attachment A, and specified in attachment B.  These sampling reports, as will be explained below, are to be generated weekly, and must be provided as summarized reports twice yearly.  What would be the expected charge for completing item a, above, regarding the field-sampling portion of the water-quality sampling program?  What would be the additional charge for each additional sample that might be necessary to meet the specification regarding "more frequent sampling" that may be required?  What would be the expected charge for the record-keeping associated with the field activities of the water-quality sampling program?  Please see Attachment B regarding the sampling structure for this task.
2.	For all practical intents and purposes, 100 percent of the salvage wells will require sampling within a Permit Required Confined Space.  Confined Space Entry training and certification is required for personnel involved with sample collection from the well array. Air quality monitoring equipment, ventilators, and other appropriate personal-protective equipment will be required.  Confined space entry procedures, training, and documentation must all follow AFD, Albuquerque Area Office, USBR, OSHA, and any other applicable regulations. This may require an entry supervisor to be present which will need to be coordinated with either the AFD Operations or AFD Maintenance groups.  If an entry supervisor is not available, you will be required to provide personnel to act in this capacity. 
The following deliverables are required for this portion of the water-quality monitoring program:
     a)	Before beginning work, all required certifications for personnel performing water-quality sampling, per this task would be required. 
Can your firm meet the confined-space-entry certification requirements for completing this portion of the water- quality sampling program?  For the field staff that you would anticipate as qualified for this work, do these persons possess current Confined Space Entry training and certification?  When were these persons so certified, by whom, and how often has their certification been re-validated?  What would be the additional cost for provision of personnel to act, if needed, in the capacity of entry supervisor?
3.	Rehabilitated wells (those that have been refurbished or re-drilled) require more frequent sampling that is dependent on stability of the observed water chemistry indicated by the water-quality sampling.  The frequency of sampling must therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Such wells, which comprise approximately 10 percent of the wells within the salvage-water well array, are expected to require water-quality sampling from twice monthly, to once weekly, for a period of up to 12 months.  These wells will also require analyses of any slime, scale, gravel and soil samples collected by the maintenance group during rehabilitation or drilling operations.  Because these 17 wells already would have been sampled at least twice yearly (pursuant to item 1, above), and assuming that these 17 wells will require an additional 3 samples per month for 8 months (with reporting of water -quality given pursuant to Attachments A and B), please estimate the additional cost for these 408 water quality samples.
The following deliverables are required for this portion of the water-quality monitoring program:
     a)	Deliverables as specified in accordance with tasks 1, 2, and 3, noted above.
What is the estimated cost of performing this aspect of the water-quality sampling program? What would be the estimated cost, on a per sample basis, for the extra sampling that may be required?  Please see Attachment B regarding the sampling structure for this task.
4.	In support of well rehabilitation efforts, additional sampling and analyses may be required to monitor and test existing and experimental chemical rehabilitation and sanitation protocols.   This is an indefinite-quantity part of the water-quality sampling program, which will require site-specific sampling and reporting protocols in each instance, on a case-by-case basis.   For each individual well being rehabilitated, an average of ten separate field work-days will usually be required in this task.  During such work, personnel may be required to accompany AFD and other contracting crews at the well sites during the entire rehabilitation process.  Coordination with the maintenance group is required for scheduling and preparing experiment plans prior to start of each project. The following deliverables are required for this portion of the water-quality monitoring program:
      a)	A comprehensive report of the rehabilitation-well sampling assessment will be required in each instance.   Such a report will necessarily include the results of all sampling protocols, along with a narrative of the procedures used in the sampling assessment.  These will include the following:
     -	Deliverables as specified in accordance with tasks 1, 2, and 3, noted above.     -	Time associated with onsite presence to sample at each process step for chemical efficacy and residual, bacterial content, and water quality.     -	Selective media, dipstick, or electrometric monitoring for chemical residual.     -	Summary reports required as detailed in Section 7, Part C, of this informational request.
If you estimated this charge on a per-instance basis, then please indicate the basic on-call charge that would be incurred on a per-instance basis for provision of these services, and the estimated cost of meeting the deliverable requirements for this task.  Please see Attachment B regarding the sampling structure for this task.
5.	There are 28 surface-flow sampling sites along the conveyance channel and 10 ancillary surface sites within the project boundary.  These sites require sampling of from 1 to 4 times monthly, up to 10 times monthly, depending on flow in the conveyance channel.   Of these 38 sites, approximately half are historically sampled sites that are sampled on a more-or-less regular basis, and 12 are mitigation sites that may require more frequent sampling.  Sample collection may be required on occasion for wells that do not have pumps installed.  A mobile sampling pump is required for such sites and must be run for at least 2 hours before obtaining samples. New sites not historically sampled must be documented with GPS coordinates.  Additional incidental work is needed on an indeterminate basis and may include sampling a network of monitoring and pilot wells.
Deliverables required for this task:
     a)	Deliverables as specified in accordance with tasks 1, 2, and 3, noted above.     b)	Summary reports required as detailed in Section 7, Parts A and B.
Estimate the costs for this task, given the following criteria: 
     -	assuming 3 sites require sampling and reporting monthly (Study Group 2), and,      -	5 sites require sampling and reporting bi-annually (Study Group 2), and     - 	25  sites require sampling and reporting annually (Study Groups 1 and 2), and      -	6 ancillary sites require sampling and reporting every 2nd month (Study Group 2), and      -	demands for on-call or incidental work sampling wells that do not have pumps and other indeterminate sampling for the network of pilot wells, on a per sample basis. 
What would be the estimated cost for this task, given the above assumptions?  Please see Attachment B regarding the sampling structure for this task.
6.	All salvage well, surface, and non-historical sites will require field analysis with a suitable multi- parameter field probe (or equivalent), in addition to the sample collected for analyte assessment back in the lab (see attachment A).  Additionally, along the conveyance channel, and at the discharge of the conveyance channel at the Rio Grande, there are a number of multi-parameter field probes that must be continuously monitored.  Each individual probe will require monthly water-quality sampling for calibration verification of the probe.   The sampling site at the discharge of the conveyance channel into the Rio Grande will require sampling twice weekly, and may require sampling daily in remediation of water-quality problems or other technical issues occurring with the operations group's SCADA system.  These sites will require at least basic field parameters and TDS.
The following deliverables are required for this portion of the water-quality monitoring program:
     a)  Once daily data import of 3 continuously deployed multi-probes (Study Group 1). Summary report required weekly (See Section 8 below).     b)  Once monthly calibration of deployed multi-probes and additional calibration that is necessary in event of probe fouling or failure.      c)  Twice weekly sampling at the canal outlet is required to verify daily data collected from multi-probe (Study Group 3).  Summary report required weekly (See Section 8 below).  Daily sampling will become necessary in the event of probe fouling, failure, or communication loss.
The daily sampling requirement for remediation or other technical issues is necessarily an indefinite quantity aspect of the program. Estimate the cost for completing this task, including the indefinite-quantity aspect.  Please see Attachment B regarding the sampling structure for this task.
7.	Records for each site must be maintained and auditable.  These records must include all aspects of a) each site visit and b) chain of custody, c) the resulting water-quality analysis, including d) results of the analysis, e) problems encountered in completing the analysis, f) resulting resolution of such problems, and g) results from quality assurance analysis.  This record-keeping aspect should be considered custodial, and such records will be regularly communicated to staff at the Alamosa Field office. All data should be available for trend analysis, graphing, spatial comparisons, well-treatment recommendations, quality control, quality assurance, and any other water quality monitoring requirements. This must be available at any time, as requested, and performed by your staff. Frequent data requests may come from internal AFD staff, or less frequently from other external sources. External data requests must be approved by the AFD manager and follow USBR and DOI regulations for distribution of such data.  Periodic reports, integral in decision making, are given to AFD staff at different intervals.
The following deliverables are required for this portion of the water-quality monitoring program:     a.	A weekly report must be provided every Monday to the AFD administrative staff, calculating a ten-day average TDS for the water discharged from the conveyance channel. Coordination with the operations group must be performed in order to obtain conductivity values from the deployed multi-parameter field probes for use in this average.  In addition, this report should include results from analyses conducted on monthly sampling sites. It must also include a percent sodium concentration as calculated from analysis performed on samples from the discharge location on the conveyance channel. 
     b.	A monthly report must also be provided at the beginning of each month to the AFD staff summarizing activities performed by the contracting laboratory, or consultant, and the sampling performed in the field for the prior month.
     c.	Status reports must be generated detailing treatment recommendations for rehabilitated wells, monitoring for chemical residual and biological status for wells prior to, during, and after a rehabilitation event.
Please provide an estimate of the expected costs for these services.
8.	To ensure that routinely generated analytical data are scientifically valid and defensible, and are of known and acceptable precision and accuracy.  A complete quality assurance plan is required. Any QC procedures specified in the standards of analysis should be included as well as any certifications held by the laboratory and laboratory personnel.  Labs must participate in at least two AFD approved, independent audits each year.  Results of such audits must be submitted to AFD management for review.  Please explain how your laboratory will achieve the objectives of this task, including the types of equipment used by the laboratory in performing the analyses described herein.  Also please detail the certifications of your laboratory staff regardingtheir qualifications in completing the analyses described herein.  Please also provide an estimate of the percentage of the costs for completing this water-quality sampling program (in its entirety) that are associated only with personnel?  With mobilization to and from the field?  With supplies?  With equipment maintenance and service?
9.	Analytes, detection limits, and standards of analysis are set forth in Attachment A.
10.	An example sampling schedule, number of samples by type, and analyses orders are set forth in Attachment B.
11.	Location of the field area and well array are given in Figure 1.

<DESC>This is a <strong>Small Business Sources Sought</strong> notice. This is <strong>NOT a solicitation</strong> for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is seeking information on a potential requirement for "Dose Reconstruction and Related Activities for Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA)."<br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the NAICS code 541990 for the potential acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong>Draft Sample Performance Based Work Statement;</strong>
<p>1. Introduction/Background.</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to allow NIOSH, through its Division of Compensation Analysis and Support (DCAS), to fulfill its obligations under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), performing dose reconstructions for claims referred by Department of Labor (DOL) and evaluating petitions for additions of classes to the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC). More specifically, the objectives are to obtain assistance in performing the following activities:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify data relevant to reconstructing radiation doses and evaluating SEC petitions<br />&bull; Claimant Communications<br />&bull; Dose estimation and reporting<br />&bull; Prepare Special Exposure Cohort petition evaluations<br />&bull; Technical and program management support</p>
<p>2. References.</p>
<p>The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA or The Act), as Amended, established a compensation program for the civilian men and women who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies. http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/theact/eeoicpaall.pdf</p>
<p>The Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) was originally passed on October 30, 2000, and became effective on July 31, 2001. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107; Section 3151(b)) and the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (Public Law 108-375; Section 3161) made several amendments to The Act</p>

<p>3. Scope and Requirements:</p>
<p>The support services that the dose reconstruction contractor will be expected to provide are listed below. It is expected that this level of support will be required during the base year and during each option year. While the number of cases to be processed on an annual basis is subject to fluctuation, offerors should prepare their proposals assuming that 3,320 dose reconstructions will be required each year (64 per week for 52 weeks). Additionally, the contractor will be required to review previously completed dose reconstruction reports to determine if changes made in methodology or new data affects the outcome of the case. These reviews do not require a fully documented dose reconstruction unless the claim's compensability decision is likely to switch from non-compensable to compensable. It should be assumed that a weekly average of approximately 55 such evaluations need to be completed. It should be understood that this is not a guarantee of this level of effort, but a target value that will facilitate comparison of proposals. Offerors should assume that, for each year of the contract, 20 SEC petitions will be filed, and claims will be received from 5 sites with no claims previously submitted. Site research will be required for those situations. Technical approaches and some calculational tools will be made available by NIOSH for claims from sites that have been researched prior to this award.</p>
<p>All documents that describe radiation exposures, radiological operations, radiological conditions, and other information useful to performing dose reconstruction, evaluating SEC petitions, or performing other functions of the project will be stored in the Site Research Database (SRD). The SRD contains documents that relate to U.S. DOE and Atomic Weapons Energy (AWE) sites. These documents can include, but are not limited to, general overview documents, publications for a site that describe a particular process or operation, or reports from a site addressing particular issues such as specific contaminants to which some workers might have been exposed. Project personnel populate and use the database to develop and write Technical Basis Documents (TBDs) and Technical Information Bulletins (TIBs), as well as to perform dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>Information relevant to individual claims will be stored in the NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System (NOCTS). NOCTS was developed to track the claims made under EEOICPA. The NOCTS application tracks claimant data and documents, and is thus a central repository for all information related to each claim. The web-based interface allows the application to be accessed by any computer equipped with Internet connection and browser software. The primary goal of NOCTS is to facilitate the processing of claims in an efficient and accurate manner. The application also provides an instrument for effective and timely communications with claimants during this process. Another goal is to establish and maintain interagency communications among all the parties involved in the claims process.</p>
<p>1.0 Identify data relevant to reconstructing radiation doses and evaluating SEC petitions</p>
<p>1.1 Data collection related to claims and petitions: The contractor will collect all known sources of recorded dosimetry, radiation data, and relevant information applicable to completing dose reconstructions for individual claimants and evaluating SEC petitions from classes of employees. This task will include the following:</p>
<p>1.1.1 NIOSH will request from DOE and provide to the contractor individual exposure information for claimants. In coordination with NIOSH and with the cooperation of DOE, the contractor will request from DOE (as necessary) and other entities supplemental information applicable to individual claims or petitions to supplement any such information in the NIOSH claims database. The collection of this information will be conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding that has been established between HHS and DOE.</p>
<p>1.1.2 The contractor will synthesize information related to dose reconstruction feasibility into Professional Judgment Papers and Petition Evaluation Reports, providing the basis for the feasibility or infeasibility of constructing radiation dose. Professional Judgment Papers evaluate the bases provided with the SEC petition to determine if they meet the criteria in 42 CFR 83 for a valid petition, i.e. to determine if the petition qualifies. Petition Evaluation Reports are prepared once petitions are qualified and they evaluate the existing information to determine if it is sufficient to perform dose reconstructions for the proposed class. Additional information about the SEC process and examples of Petition Evaluation Reports can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocassec.html.</p>
<p>1.1.3 The contractor will maintain a local office in Cincinnati, Ohio, to abstract, enter, or migrate necessary information from DOE and other records into the Site Research Database or NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System for use in dose reconstructions or other purposes.</p>
<p>1.1.4 The contractor will monitor the completeness and timeliness of record/information acquired from DOE and other sources, inform NIOSH, on a monthly basis, of delays, their causes, and involve NIOSH as necessary to obtain their timely resolution.</p>
<p>1.2 Dose reconstruction research: The contractor will research the conditions, processes, practices, and incidents at DOE and AWE facilities relevant to conducting dose reconstructions. This task will include the following:</p>
<p>1.2.1 The contractor will review and analyze records from DOE and AWEs, which will be useful to interpret recorded dosimetry information, to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of dosimetry information, and to substitute for unavailable or incomplete dosimetry information. Plans for site visits and the research to be performed during a site visit must be approved by NIOSH. It is likely that 50 site data capture visits may be required each year.</p>
<p>1.2.2 With the cooperation of DOE and assistance of worker representatives and others, the contractor will identify and interview current and former DOE/AWE facility line managers, radiation protection personnel, individual workers, and others as appropriate, and analyze the results of these interviews to interpret recorded dosimetry information, to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of dosimetry information, and to substitute for unavailable or incomplete dosimetry information. The extent of these efforts shall be coordinated with and approved by NIOSH prior to initiation of contact with DOE or DOE contractor personnel.</p>
<p>1.2.3 As agreed upon between NIOSH and the contractor, the contractor will develop statistical procedures and assumptions based on dose reconstruction research that can be applied in multiple dose reconstructions, including but not limited to dose reconstructions for employees in specific jobs, performing specific tasks, employed in specific facilities or sites, and related to specific time periods of employment. These statistical procedures will include methods to estimate the uncertainty distributions surrounding internal and external dose reconstructions on a facility specific and time-dependent basis. NIOSH will review and approve such procedures and assumptions. Technical information bulletins ORAUT-OTIB-0019 and -0020 describe these techniques.</p>
<p>1.2.4 The contractor will produce and submit to NIOSH reports summarizing methods, data sources, and findings of research on facilities on a schedule specified by NIOSH as the need for the report is identified.</p>
<p>1.2.5 The contractor will research and analyze information pertaining to sites, claims, and dose reconstruction processes in response to questions and technical issues raised about the EEOICPA program by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. Results of these efforts will be provided as scheduled by NIOSH.</p>
<p>2.0 Claimant communications</p>
<p>2.1 As directed under 42 CFR 82 and consistent with NIOSH technical guides and procedures, conduct, record, transmit to NIOSH, and report to claimants the results of computer assisted telephone interviews (CATIs) with claimants and, as appropriate, with co-workers and other potential witnesses. Three scripts that cover interviews with claimants who are covered employees, survivors, or co-workers have been prepared. Since these scripts have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, any substantive changes will require approval by OMB. NIOSH will provide a usable computerized version of these scripts. The contractor may, however, with review and approval from NIOSH, convert these scripts to a computer program that facilitates more efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>
<p><br />2.2 The contractor will produce and provide for review by the claimant/interviewee reports of interviews, and enter final reports and their elements as a case file into the claims database no less frequently than weekly.</p>
<p>2.3 The contractor will obtain and enter into the claimant interview case file and research database additional information as may be provided by the claimant in writing to supplement the claim record.</p>
<p>2.4 The contractor will conduct close-out interviews with claimants once they have received their draft dose reconstruction reports in order to answer questions about the dose reconstruction and to explain the next steps in the claim process.</p>
<p>2.5 Although not part of the interview process, the contractor must provide a toll free telephone line to address claimants' questions within 30 days of award. This will be in addition to the claimant telephone support service that NIOSH is currently offering.</p>
<p>2.6 The contractor will correspond with claimants informing them that their dose reconstruction has been scheduled once all the information necessary to perform the dose reconstruction has been received, but not before.</p>
<p>2.7 The contractor will designate a point of contact within its organization who is responsible for resolving issues and answering questions from communications with claimants by either NIOSH or the contractor. This point of contact shall have the organizational authority necessary to resolve issues between suborganizations within the contractor's organization in order to provide resolutions and answers.</p>
<p>2.8 When the contractor receives information from a claimant that affects the normal progress of the claim (e.g., identifies an additional cancer not listed on the claim, provides information that affects the draft dose reconstruction, etc.) the contractor shall notify NIOSH's Claimant Information and Communication Team of the reason for the interruption in claim progress. Information of this nature that is received by NIOSH will be communicated promptly to the contractor. In all cases the contractor will communicate the resolution to the claimant.</p>
<p>2.9 Contractor shall provide CATI and close out interview for every claimant for whom a dose reconstruction is performed unless claimant declines to participate. Some claims have multiple claimants, so the number of claimants is larger than the number of dose reconstructions that must be completed. Contractor should plan to complete 1.5 CATIs and close out interviews per dose reconstruction, or 96 CATIs and close out interviews per week.</p>
<p>3.0 Dose estimation and reporting</p>
<p>3.1 As directed under 42 CFR Part 82 and consistent with NIOSH Implementation Guides for Internal and External Dose Reconstruction (located at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocasdose.html#process), and technical information bulletins and procedures, the contractor will produce and report timely dose estimates, supporting methodology, and factual basis for each claim received by NIOSH from DOL under EEOICPA and for claims requiring re-work because of changes in claim information or changes in dose reconstruction policy (estimated at 3320 dose reconstructions and re-works annually).</p>
<p>3.2 The contractor will collect and analyze all available information relevant to dose estimation/reconstruction for each individual claim and produce and transmit to NIOSH a draft report providing dose estimates, methods, and the factual basis upon which the doses were estimated, including a narrative explanation of this information understandable by claimants with a high school education.</p>
<p>3.2.1 Internal and external radiation dose estimates will be calculated for each organ that the claimant presents with a primary cancer. The annual dose to each organ will be calculated from the time of first exposure at a covered facility to the date of cancer diagnosis. As appropriate, a separate dose will be computed for each type of radiation exposure received by the individual, using the exposure types provide for in the NIOSH-Interactive Radio Epidemiological Program (IREP) program. These doses will be reported as equivalent dose using the weighting factors provided in the NIOSH technical guides. As part of NIOSH's ongoing Quality Assurance (QA) program, the contractor may be provided blind test claims on a periodic basis.</p>
<p>3.2.2 Internal dose calculations will be performed using standard metabolic models published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These calculations will be performed using a NIOSH supplied computer program entitled Integrated Module for Bioassay Analysis (IMBA) or other NIOSH approved programs. IMBA was specially created for NIOSH to perform internal dose calculations using the most recent physiologically based biokinetic models such as those contained in ICRP publications 56, 67, and 69. Inhalation intakes will be evaluated using the respiratory tract model contained in ICRP publication 66. The contractor will not have access to the source code. Any contractor developed software used for calculating internal dose must be approved by NIOSH prior to its use in dose reconstructions and NIOSH must have access to the program and source code. Any contractor purchased software used for calculating internal dose must be approved by NIOSH prior to its use in dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>Within 30 days of award, NIOSH will provide training on the IMBA software for key contractor personnel who are not familiar with the software. Within 30 days after receiving training from NIOSH, the contractor will be responsible for providing and documenting training to members of its technical team who will be involved in conducting dose reconstructions and are not already familiar with the software.</p>
<p>3.2.3 Estimates of missed dose, due to technical limitations in monitoring technology, will be evaluated and included in the claimant's dose reconstruction for both internal and external sources of exposure. In addition, any exposure to diagnostic x-rays that were required as a condition of employment will be estimated and included in the claimant's total organ dose.</p>
<p>3.3 The contractor will review with NIOSH and revise dose reconstructions, as necessary, subject to NIOSH oversight of the dose reconstruction program.</p>
<p>3.4 The contractor will develop statistical procedures and assumptions that may have application for multiple dose reconstructions, including but not limited to dose reconstructions for employees in specific jobs, performing specific tasks, employed in specific facilities or sites, and related to specific time periods of employment. NIOSH will review and approve these procedures and assumptions before they are used to complete dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>4.0 Prepare Special Exposure Cohort petition evaluations</p>
<p>4.1 In accordance with 42 CFR 83 and procedure OCAS-PR-004 the contractor will process and evaluate petitions received from individuals for the addition of classes to the SEC, and will initiate the addition of classes when there is not adequate information to reconstruct radiation doses with sufficient accuracy.</p>
<p>4.2 The contractor will process and evaluate petitions received from individuals for additions of classes to the SEC (the 83.13 process).</p>
<p>4.2.1 With the approval of NIOSH, the contractor will communicate with the petition submitter as necessary in order to obtain the information required in 42 CFR 83 for a petition. Some petitions may be sufficient upon initial receipt, but NIOSH expects that every petition will require communication of this type to obtain information required by 42 CFR 83.</p>
<p>4.2.2 The contractor will determine whether the information ultimately submitted with a petition meets the requirements in 42 CFR 83 and therefore qualifies for evaluation. Contractor will document the basis for this determination in a professional judgment and submit it to NIOSH.</p>
<p>4.2.3 For petitions that qualify for evaluation, the contractor shall provide a list of the types of apparent data deficiencies that could potentially make dose reconstructions infeasible, along with the research efforts that the contractor will pursue to remedy each apparent data deficiency, and shall submit the list to NIOSH for review and approval. The schedule for delivering the list will be established by NIOSH upon qualification of a petition, depending on the complexity of the petition.</p>
<p>4.2.4 The contractor shall research information relevant to the feasibility of the dose reconstruction for members of the class; reach determinations about the feasibility of reconstructing doses for members of the class and the potential that members of the class were harmed by their exposure; document those determinations in a petition evaluation report; and submit the petition evaluation report to NIOSH for review and approval. The petition evaluation report must be completed and approved by NIOSH within 180 days from the date the petition was originally submitted to NIOSH, not counting days when NIOSH and the contractor are awaiting additional information from the submitter in order to fulfill the petition qualification requirements of 42 CFR 83.</p>
<p>4.2.5 The contractor will provide additional research and revision to petition evaluation reports to respond to questions raised by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health ("the Board"). NIOSH anticipates that every petition evaluation report will prompt questions from the Board. Such questions have required detailed follow-up analysis of complex issues such as monitoring program adequacy, technical performance of internal and external dosimetry systems, and characterization of the radiation fields present at sites being evaluated.</p>
<p>4.3 The contractor will identify classes of workers for whom there is inadequate information to perform dose reconstruction with sufficient accuracy, and initiate adding those classes to the SEC (the 83.14 process).</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.
<p><br />The NIH Clinical Center is the sponsoring institution at the National Institutes of Health responsive for the administrative support and oversight of graduate medical education programs designed to train physicians, recruited through a competitive nation-wide search process, in a total of 18 nationally recognized medical/surgical specialties. These graduate medical education programs provide prescribed certification as specialists in a recognized medical or surgical field by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), a national organization that has established a process for verifying the competence of individual physicians in such recognized medical or surgical specialty fields.</p>
<p>However, the prescribed standards and program structure required for the training for physician in a given medical or surgical specialty field are developed and verified, both for training programs and institutions which sponsor those training programs, through a national process of accreditation established by another organization, the Accreditation council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), located in Chicago, Illinois Graduate medical education training programs and those institutions that sponsor medical or surgical training programs in a recognized specialty field, such as the NIH Clinical Center, are expected to be accredited by the ACGME in order to permit training program graduates to be certified by the ABMS. It should be noted that those graduate medical education programs and sponsoring institutions that are not accredited by the ACGME are not recognized as providing required training that permits physicians to be certified as medical or surgical specialist by the ABMS.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether those sources are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) the size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br />Background<br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking to better understand the progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) through the initiation of an observational study of adults newly diagnosed with MDS (The National MDS Study). For additional information, please refer to Request for Information Notice Number HHS-NIH-NHLBI-RFI-12-147 (https://www.fbo.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/NHLBI/HHS-NIH-NHLBI-RFI-12-147/listing.html), titled "Building a National Resource to Study Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) -The MDS Cohort Natural History Study."<br />An estimated 20,000 or more new cases of MDS are diagnosed in the United States each year. The incidence of MDS dramatically increases with age. MDS is a heterogeneous collection of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. While most cases occur in older adults, chemotherapy and other toxin-induced MDS and MDS due to inherited disorders occur in younger persons as well. Those suffering with this syndrome are predisposed to iron overload from repeated transfusions, lethal infections, and life-threatening bleeding. Some patients with MDS can develop chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia. Mortality resulting from hemorrhage or infection from failure of normal hematopoiesis is high. Most therapies for MDS are suboptimal and not curative. <br />MDS is frequently asymptomatic, but clinically suspected in older patients with abnormal routine blood tests, recurrent infections, or excessive bleeding. Diagnosis requires evaluation of bone marrow for evidence of cells that are maturing abnormally and malignant cells. These findings, combined with peripheral cytopenia(s), abnormal bone marrow cytogenetics, and the degree of transfusion dependence, classify patients with MDS into risk groups and provide a general assessment of disease severity and possible prognosis. Biomarkers clinically useful for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of a patient's response to therapy are not available.<br />Currently the etiologies of MDS are not well defined. Distinct mutations and genetic modifications are thought to underlie the molecular basis of MDS, some of which may be independent predictors of poor survival. A comprehensive standardized longitudinal clinical dataset and a consistently-processed, well-annotated biospecimen collection will provide national resources that potentially can be used to: (1) identify genetic, epigenetic and biological factors associated with initiation and progression of MDS; (2) uncover fundamental information on the changes that occur in hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow stroma during normal aging; (3) reveal clinically useful biomarkers; (4) identify potential targets for new interventions; and (5) facilitate understanding of how MDS are managed in practice. These resources will facilitate the conduct of basic and translational research on the evolution of MDS over time, and improve the diagnosis and clinical management of affected individuals. <br />Purpose and Objectives<br />The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as the Central Laboratory and Biorepository (CL/B) for a new program, The National Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Natural History Study (The National MDS Study). During the seven year contract period, this new program will establish a cohort of up to 3000 adults recently diagnosed with MDS and create a comprehensive standardized longitudinal clinical dataset linked to a prospective collection of high-quality, well-characterized biospecimens to advance the understanding of disease progression. A small number of age-matched adults who are not diagnosed with MDS, but clinically suspected of having this syndrome, will be enrolled on the study. The National MDS Study protocol will define the clinical data and biospecimens to be collected, and research studies that will be performed on biospecimens to provide additional data (genetic, molecular, and biological) to enrich the value of the clinical data set and the biospecimen collection. The biospecimen collection, clinical data set, and datasets generated by the protocol-defined research studies will support current and future research in MDS, and be made available to the scientific community as national resources to encourage research to advance the understanding of the biology and genetics of these syndromes. <br />Overall coordination of The National MDS Study will be performed by a Data Coordinating Center (DCC; see Sources Sought Notice #HHS-NHLBI-SBSS-2014-05). The CL/B will collaborate with the DCC and experts appointed by NHLBI to develop a protocol for The National MDS Study, conduct the study, and build a resource that will be comprised of well-annotated, quality biospecimens linked to comprehensive clinical, genetic, and molecular datasets. The CL/B will provide the scientific and technical expertise and the facilities to design, build, and store a quality biospecimen collection that will be linked to phenotypic, molecular and genotypic data. The biospecimens will be collected from participants enrolled at multiple clinical sites. The CL/B will also perform research assays defined in the study protocol and transfer the biospecimen collection to a new facility at the end of the contract. <br />During the contract period, biospecimens will be made available to the wider scientific community for approved scientific research protocols following procedures established by the NHLBI and The National MDS Study. At the end of the contract, the resource will be made available through the NHLBI Biologic Specimen and Data Repositories Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) program (www.biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov).<br />Project Requirements<br />The CL/B is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:<br />1. Experienced and highly competent in managing a central laboratory, performing and interpreting research assays, and designing and building hematological biospecimen collections for multi-center clinical studies.<br />2. Key personnel with demonstrated knowledge and leadership, as attested by his/her publication record, in: designing hematological biospecimen collections for multi-center clinical studies; serving as a central laboratory for multi-center clinical studies storing hematological biospecimens (e.g., bone marrow, plasma, serum, whole blood); and performing research using fresh and frozen samples.<br />3. Key personnel with demonstrated knowledge in developing and implementing procedures to establish a central laboratory and build a biospecimen collection for multi-center clinical studies, and managing multi-center clinical study central laboratories and biospecimen collections. <br />4. Receive, process, inventory, aliquot, store, retrieve, distribute, and track hematological biospecimens, including histopathology slides, collected on multi-center clinical studies using validated procedures.<br />5. Perform research in MDS using fresh and frozen samples and interpret and apply the results, including performing and interpreting immunophenotyping assays, and isolating cell populations. <br />6. Provide a validated electronic biospecimen and laboratory management system and customize the system to enable study-specific functions to be performed. <br />7. Develop and distribute study-specific barcode label sets, collection kits, forms, and shipping materials to collection sites.<br />8. Develop, implement, and manage a program to train site personnel to perform study specific procedures and monitor collection site performance.<br />9. Transfer a biospecimen collection and all associated electronic documents and data files in a secure and safe manner to a new facility. <br />Other Important Considerations<br />The solicitation release date is pending. The Government intends to negotiate one (1) cost-reimbursement Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for a period of seven years with an approximate award date of June 30, 2014.<br />Capability Statement - How to Submit a Response<br />Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer. The capabilities statement must specifically address each project requirement separately.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID. INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST WILL BE CONSIDERED PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE AND WILL NOT BE RELEASED TO ANY OTHER PARTY, FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO DEVELOP MARKET INFORMATION FOR INTERNAL USE BY THE ST. LOUIS DISTRICT, CORPS OF ENGINEERS. The NAICS code for this proposed acquisition is 237990. The Product Service Code is Y299. The control number for this notice is W912P9-13-S-0001. The Government will use responses to this Sources Sought notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions regarding the possible procurement of Chain of Rocks Ditch Work, Phase 2 <br>  <br> Project Description <br> The project consists of replacing an existing 48 quote mark  culvert with a 72 quote mark  diameter reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The section of new pipe is approximately 230 feet in length, and is underneath an existing railroad embankment. The height of fill over the culvert ranges from approximately 15 feet outside the railroad embankment to approximately 35 feet directly under the railroad tracks. Four new precast concrete manholes will be required in order to tie into the existing 72 quote mark  RCP that exists on either side of the existing 48 quote mark  culvert. Two existing manholes will be removed. <br>  <br> The means of installation of the culvert will be by the jack-and-bore method. This specialized method is required to minimize disturbance to the embankment, and the operations of the railroad. This method includes excavating adjacent to the railroad embankment on each side, and pushing the sections of RCP through the embankment by boring through the soil and jacking against the wall of the excavation. The selected contractor must be capable of completing the project using this jack-and-bore method. The project will not be allowed to be constructed using open-cut excavations through the railroad embankment. <br>  <br> The PDT recommends experience requirements be placed on the contractor to ensure a capable contractor with prior experience with this specialized jack-and-bore method is selected.  The recommended requirement is that the contractor has completed no fewer than five successful projects using this method to install RCP culverts of at least 60 inches in diameter. Contractor will have at least five years experience in using the jack-and-bore method. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Contractors will provide:  <br>  <br> 1) Firm name, address, e-mail, telephone and fax number.  <br>  <br> 2) If submitting as a small business, provide identification of the company as a Small Business with proper certification; 8(a), Hub Zone, Service Disabled Veteran or Woman-Owned.  <br>  <br> 3) Address your capability to secure bonding for the projects described above in the range of $1 to $5 Million. <br>  <br> 4) Experience of five years using the jack-and-bore method. The estimated price range of each project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  The NAICS Code is 237990 and the small business size standard is $33.5 million.  The Corp will require the prime contractor to have documentable experience showing completed projects of similar size and scope using the jack-and-bore method.  Firms interested and capable of providing the required services should provide: <br>  <br>  a)      The company name, address, Point of Contact (POC), size of business pursuant to the following questions:  (1) is your business small?  (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emerging business or a small disadvantaged business?  (3)  If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business.  (4)  Is your firm a certified Hub Zone firm?  (5)  Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business:   <br>  <br>  b)     At least five (5) similar, completed contracts, performance rating and POC.   <br>  <br> 5.  Interested contractors should submit a copy of a Capability Statement that exhibits clear and convincing evidence of your firm's capabilities/experiences to perform the above work.  The capability statement is not to exceed 7 pages (front and back).  Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  <br>  <br> Responses must be received no later than 2:00 p.m., Central Standard Time, 04 December  2012, to the following address:  Contracting Division, Attn: Barrietta Killiebrew, St Louis District, Corps of Engineers, 1222 Spruce Street, Room 4.207, St Louis, Missouri, 63103-2833 or e-mail to: Barrietta.Killiebrew@usace.army.mil.

The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 12. 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is AG-7MN1-S-09-0006 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The NAICS is 444220, business size is $6.5 million.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31.

The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, Weslaco, Texas has a need for Nursery grown Arunda donax plants.  The laboratory requires 15,600 plants to be delivered 1200 per week over a 13 week period.  The following will detail the specific requirements.  Arundo donax L., giant reed is an exotic and invasive weed of riparian habitats and irrigation canals of the Rio Grande River Basin and the southwestern U.S.  Arundo dominates these habitats, which leads to: loss of biodiversity; catastrophic stream bank erosion; damage to bridges; increased costs for chemical and mechanical control along transportation corridors, and impedes law enforcement activities on the international border. Additionally, this invasive weed competes for water resources in an arid region where these resources are critical to the environment, agriculture and municipal users.  Biological control using insects from the native range of Arundo may be the best option for long-term management of this weed. Arundo donax is a good target for biological control because it has no close relatives in North or South America, and several of the plant-feeding insects from its native range in Mediterranean Europe are known to be specialists feeding only on this one plant species.  USDA-ARS has an on-going biological control program for Arundo.  Additional plant production of Arundo is needed for use in the insect mass-rearing program.  1) Contractor will grow Arundo donax plants in 3 gallon plants.  2) Contractor will provide 2 weekly deliveries (every Monday and Thursday) of 600ea for a total of 1200 per week, 3 gallon pots of Arundo donax plants.  3) Contractor will deliver healthy Arundo donax plants with shoots between 1 and 2 feet tall, no shorter or taller.  4) Contractor must obtain prior approval from USDA, ARS to apply any insecticides to plants. (NO insecticide use without prior approval).  5) Arundo donax plants must be grown from Arundo donax rhizomes (4-8 inches long) that are mechanically field harvested by the Contractor from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.  6) Plants must be grown in an enclosed and heated greenhouse that will not have any insecticide use on other crops.  Greenhouses must be capable of maintaining a minimum average temperature of 80 degrees F during winter.  7) Plants must be grown from rhizomes that are no older than 1 month from field harvest.  8) Contractor will deliver plants to greenhouse facilities at USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N. Moorefield Rd., Edinburg, TX 78541.  9) USDA reserves the right to cancel the contract with 30 days of prior notice. 10) Period of the performance is 13 weeks beginning July 6, 2009.  Price to include delivery to the USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N Moorefield Road, Edinburg, Texas 78541.  Each offeror shall include their proposed delivery schedule as part of their quotation.

<DESC>This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC), Restoration Technical Support Branch (CZTE) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Environmental Restoration Program (ERP) and Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP). This solicitation is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field (i.e., a service). The Restoration Program areas of need for this announcement are:<br /><br />a. Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs) Remediation Technologies: To date the Air Force has experienced little to no success regarding low energy technologies (i.e., passive in situ) for the remediation of PFCs. Additionally, discussions with 3M and a review of Vecitis1 et al., 2009 indicate that simple oxidative and reductive approaches may not work with these recalcitrant compounds. Furthermore, proposers should be aware of ongoing studies funded through AFCEC BAA Program and DoD SERDP/ESTCP to avoid redundancy. In addition, the Air Force prefers in situ remediation technologies; however, PFC remediation challenges may dictate the use of ex situ technologies. For example, treatment trains as part of an existing pump and treatment system may be appropriate. Beware that the Air Force has a policy that prohibits the installation of a new pump and treat system without Headquarters level approval. Therefore, proposals should identify PFCs innovative treatment technologies but any technology or methodology should consider any relative successes or failures as highlighted by Vecitis et al., 2009, AFCEC BAA Program, and DoD SERDP/ESTCP.<br /><br />b. 1,4-Dioxane Remediation Technologies: To date AFCEC BAA Program and DoD SERDP/ESTCP have funded many projects with particular focus on in situ treatment technologies for 1,4-dioxane groundwater remediation. Proposers should be aware of ongoing studies to avoid redundancy. The Air Force prefers in situ remediation technologies but recognizes the limitations of 1,4-dioxane remediation and will support the use of ex situ technologies. For example, treatment trains as part of an existing pump and treatment system may be appropriate. Additionally, the Air Force has a policy that prohibits the installation of a new pump and treat system without Headquarters level approval. Therefore, proposals should identify 1,4-dioxane innovative treatment technologies but any technology or methodology should consider any relative successes or failures as highlighted by AFCEC BAA Program and DoD SERDP/ESTCP.
<p>Eligible Offeror/Applicants: This requirement is restricted to US - companies, academic institutions, non-profit institutions, and/or government agencies. Foreign participants and/or individuals may participate as subcontractors to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Acquisition Overview: The AFCEC BAA is a two-step process that includes two phases of proposal submittals:</p>
<p>Phase I - submit a 2 page online form (white paper/pre-proposal) at <br />http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa</p>
<p>Phase II - if invited, submit a full proposal that details the technology, the demonstration, and validation approach, and the costs for the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Relevant forms, samples and guides are found on FedBizOps and the AFCEC BAA Website. Evaluation criteria for Phase I are included in the proposal instruction document provided in this announcement. The anticipated award of AFCECBAA-13-001 is Fiscal Year 13, 3rd Quarter.</p>
<p>How to Apply: All Phase I white papers/pre-proposals must be submitted as an online form and can be accessed through AFCEC's website (http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa). Each electronic submission shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. <br /><br />PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 11 JANUARY 2013. Phase I submittals received after 11 January 2013 will be handled according to the rules under FAR52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Evaluation/Notification: Phase I white papers/pre-proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the evaluation criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs (as indicated in the Phase I evaluation criteria) are notified electronically via email to submit a proposal to Phase II (request for proposal); those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are sent to key personnel contact information listed in Phase I white paper/pre-proposal along with a Request for Proposal (RFP) Package, Phase II instructions, how and when Phase II proposals are to be submitted to the Air Force. To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required.</p>
<p>This is the first solicitation to FY13 BAA announcement. If an Offeror has submitted to previous AFCEC BAA solicitations and would like to be reconsidered under this announcement, the Offeror will need to re-submit a new or revised pre-proposal/white paper as stated below.</p>
<p>Please review all past AFCECBAA-11-001 Complete Questions and Answers (attached) before submitting a question to the Contracting Officer (CO).</p>

The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>** OCCUPATIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCA DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **<br />Aerial Photographer<br />The aerial photographer must be skilled in reading flight maps, capable of<br />assisting the pilot to adhere to flight lines, be able to level and operate a<br />cartographic camera and its auxiliary equipment mounted in the aircraft so that<br />the photographs that are taken will have the required forward lap and side lap<br />for use in photogrammetric mapping equipment, and possess a working knowledge of<br />aerial films and camera filters to insure proper exposure of the films.</p>

Assists<br />or relieves an airline captain in operating the controls of an airplane;<br />monitoring flight and engine instruments; and maintaining air-to-ground<br />communications.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:</p>

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>** OCCUPATIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCA DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **<br />Aerial Photographer<br />The aerial photographer must be skilled in reading flight maps, capable of<br />assisting the pilot to adhere to flight lines, be able to level and operate a<br />cartographic camera and its auxiliary equipment mounted in the aircraft so that<br />the photographs that are taken will have the required forward lap and side lap<br />for use in photogrammetric mapping equipment, and possess a working knowledge of<br />aerial films and camera filters to insure proper exposure of the films.</p>

<p>(e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause.</p>

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination.

Upon receipt of the final decision in the protest, the Contracting Officer shall either-<br />(1) Cancel the stop-work order; or<br />(2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if-<br />(1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and<br />(2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted at any time before final payment under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.</p>
<p>(d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.</p>
<p>(e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause.</p>
<p>(f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>** OCCUPATIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCA DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **<br />Aerial Photographer<br />The aerial photographer must be skilled in reading flight maps, capable of<br />assisting the pilot to adhere to flight lines, be able to level and operate a<br />cartographic camera and its auxiliary equipment mounted in the aircraft so that<br />the photographs that are taken will have the required forward lap and side lap<br />for use in photogrammetric mapping equipment, and possess a working knowledge of<br />aerial films and camera filters to insure proper exposure of the films.</p>

<p>(b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if-<br />(1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and<br />(2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted at any time before final payment under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.</p>
<p>(d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.</p>
<p>(e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause.</p>
<p>(f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs.

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>** OCCUPATIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCA DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **<br />Aerial Photographer<br />The aerial photographer must be skilled in reading flight maps, capable of<br />assisting the pilot to adhere to flight lines, be able to level and operate a<br />cartographic camera and its auxiliary equipment mounted in the aircraft so that<br />the photographs that are taken will have the required forward lap and side lap<br />for use in photogrammetric mapping equipment, and possess a working knowledge of<br />aerial films and camera filters to insure proper exposure of the films.</p>
<p>First Officer (Co-Pilot)<br />Is second in command of commercial airplane and its crew while transporting<br />passengers, mail, or other cargo on scheduled or nonscheduled flights. Assists<br />or relieves an airline captain in operating the controls of an airplane;<br />monitoring flight and engine instruments; and maintaining air-to-ground<br />communications.</p>

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires a training course to increase the bureau's capacity to assess the outcomes of proposed changes, build organizational support, develop plans to manage the transitions and assess the effectiveness of both the transition and the change. The course entitled, "Leading Strategic Corporate Change and Transition", is a critical piece of the IRS leadership curriculum for experienced Senior Managers and is designed to encourage best practice leadership behaviors. We believe this course is equally vital for all Senior Managers across the Treasury Bureaus, as well as our partners in other Federal agencies.
<p>All of our Treasury Bureaus and agency partners experience continuous change - some of it minor, but much of it significant. A significant risk of any major change is the failure to manage the transition from &lsquo;what is' to &lsquo;what will be'. While Change Management is an important competency for workers at all levels throughout Treasury and the Federal Government, it is especially critical for the top leaders (experienced Senior Managers and Executive Readiness Program** participants) of these organizations. Successful leaders demonstrate both the ability to envision, market and implement changes and the ability to assume ownership and implement changes designed by others. Their role may vary depending on the magnitude of the change, but one thing will remain constant - their ability to lead the change has the potential to make or break the change.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver an already developed experiential learning** course, "Leading Strategic Corporate Change and Transition", to experienced IRS (as well as other Bureaus/Agencies') Senior Managers and Executive Readiness Program** participants, when needed by the IRS. The course must meet all of the requirements and specifications herein. The IRS intends to award a performance-based, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to cover the delivery of (a) the course, (b) course materials, (c) tools and resources, (d) instruction, (e) travel and lodging for Instructors and other designated Contractor Key Personnel and (f) other deliverables as described. The aforementioned deliverables (services) will be ordered via individual Delivery Orders against the contract. The IRS estimates a maximum of four (4)) courses in the Base Year and a maximum of four (4) courses for each Option Year.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is RFQ2768195 and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This is a total Small Business set-aside. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 238990 with a Small Business size standard of 14.0 million dollars. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-62.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), has a requirement to install covering on Reverse Osmosis (RO) water piping located on seven (7) floors of an 8-story biomedical research facility, located at Building #49 on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD. NIMH seeks to improve the quality of water provided to laboratories contained on these floors by insulating the system of RO piping located on floors starting at B1 through 6, on the east and west utility corridors.</p>
<p>Algae have been forming in portions of the polypropylene piping that are exposed to light sources, mainly from standard fluorescent lights. NIMH requires covering the RO piping with a material that will block light from entering and prevent the growth of algae. Covering the RO piping will decrease the need for disruptive flushing procedures and future expenses.<br /><br />Vendors shall propose a material and labor cost to cover the RO piping system in this part of Building #49, which is currently uncovered. Thermal insulation properties will have no adverse impact on the RO piping system. Pipe covering installed by the vendor shall cover the existing labeling on the RO piping. Re-labeling the covering on each run in a similar manner as the existing labeling is required. For Quotation purposes, the vendor is to assume installation of RO covering includes at minimum:<br />4,000 feet of 1/2 inch thick pipe insulation, 500 90-degree elbows; <br />100 feet of 3/4 inch pipe insulation, 20 90-degree elbows; <br />30 feet of 1-1/4 inch pipe insulation;<br />100 feet of 1-1/2 inch pipe insulation.<br /><br />Evaluation Factors: Offerors will be evaluated on their ability to meet the required technical specifications described in this solicitation and on best value in relation to pricing. Quotations are to be sent electronically to hunter.tjugum@nih.gov prior to the closing date and time specified in this RFQ.</p>
<p>Davis-Bacon Act certified payroll wages are in effect for this procurement.

<CONTACT>Aaron H. Ford, Procuring Contracting Officer, Phone 2022546032, Fax 2022546911, Email Aaron.Ford@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate, Chemical and Biological Division (CBD) seek technologies to prevent and defend against a chemical and biological attack. Within the CBD is the Threat Characterization and Attribution (TCA) Branch, which has the mission to conduct threat and risk assessments on both traditional and advance agents; conduct experiments to close major scientific gaps; provide scientific support to the biodefense, chemical defense and intelligence communities; and provide the Nation with an operational biological and chemical forensics capability. The Chemical Forensics Program supports the latter part of the above TCA mission. The threat of terrorist or criminal use of Chemical Threat Agents (CTAs) is of great concern in the United States. There are vulnerabilities that create the need to perform chemical analyses for attribution in a rigorous scientific manner. As part of the effort to deter criminal and terrorist chemical attacks and strengthen the law enforcement response to such an act, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 22, a classified document dealing with domestic chemical defense, was issued. An unclassified portion of this document addresses attribution as a means of identifying the nature and source of materials, the perpetrators and the methods of chemical attacks.
<p>The primary internal customers of the Chemical Forensics Program are law enforcement and intelligence components of DHS, and the primary external customer is the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) due to its lead investigative agency role in acts of terrorism. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks to provide sound scientific techniques related to supporting attribution analyses leading to the capture, indictment, and prosecution of the perpetrator(s) of a criminal or terrorist act involving the actual or threatened use of CTAs.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-931)<br />U S COAST GUARD HEADQUARTERS<br />PROCUREMENT PLANNING &amp; OVERSIGHT DIVISION<br />1900 HALF STREET, SW, JR11-0203<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-0001</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 14 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 14 days, required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 11/27/2012.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>Commanding Officer<br />Attn: Visitor Control (Code 6.5.2)<br />Fleet Readiness Center East <br />PSC Box 8021<br />Cherry Point, NC 28533-0021</p>
<p>(d) Visit request must be faxed to 252.464.8867 at least three (3) working days prior to the visit.</p>
<p>(e) Although a security clearance is not required for the site visit, all contractor representatives must be U.S. citizens and will be required to furnish a valid driver's license or other generally acceptable form of picture identification for issuance of a visitors badge allowing for entrance into the facility. Substitution of personnel is not allowed. Technology/Electronic (Flash Media) devices, Photography (including cellular telephones with camera capability), and/or the use of recording devices within the facility are strictly prohibited</p>
<p>(f) Additional information regarding access to the Air Station and FRC East is available by phone at 252.464.7397 or by accessing the FRC East web-site at https://www.navair.navy.mil/frce/visinfo.html. Failure to submit the proper visit request information may result in denial of access to the facility. Additional site visits will not be scheduled as a result of such failure.</p>
<p>2. The MCAS Cherry Point main gate is located off NC State Highway 101, Havelock, NC. Visitors without proper vehicle identification are required to check-in at the visitor's center adjacent to the main gate. Once through the Main Gate, proceed to Building 137. Directions from the main gate to Building 137 are available upon request at the visitor's center. Participants should allow at least one hour for check-in at the main gate and travel to the FRC East location. Participants will depart from the main lobby of Building 137 promptly at 9:30 AM EST.

<p>3. Participants will be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of hard hat, hearing protection, eye protection, safety vest (florescent orange or yellow) and safety shoes. PPE will not be provided by the facility. Contractor representatives without the appropriate PPE will not be allowed access to the facility and additional site visits will not be scheduled as a result of such failure.</p>
<p>4. The purpose of the site visit is to allow contractors the opportunity to inspect the site of the existing equipment (where the new equipment is to be installed) in order to be better able to relate to the specification requirements. The site visit, in conjunction with the work requirements identified in the final specification, should provide contractors a detailed understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p>5. The site visit is not intended to be a pre-proposal conference and therefore will NOT be an open forum for questions. Contractors must submit questions concerning, or request clarification of, any aspect of the draft specification electronically via e-mail to angela.f.little@usmc.mil no later than Dec 12, 2012. Comments and questions must reference Request for Quotation M00146-13-Q-P008.</p>
<p>6. Failure of a contractor to submit questions regarding this requirement or to attend the Site Visit will be construed to mean that the contractor fully understands all requirements of the final specification and Request for Quotation. In no event will failure of a contractor to submit questions or inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.</p>
<p>7. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Interested contractors should continue to monitor the NECO web sites for additional information and documents relating to this requirement.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />Background<br />In 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) was enacted into law. Section 1013 of MMA authorizes AHRQ to conduct research, demonstrations, and evaluations designed to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The essential goals of the Section 1013 mandate are to develop valid evidence, and make it easily accessible to decision makers, about the comparative effectiveness of different treatments and appropriate clinical approaches to an array of health problems. Achieving these goals will encompass reviewing, synthesizing, and translating published and unpublished scientific evidence, as well as identifying important issues for which existing scientific evidence is insufficient for making adequate decisions about health care. To fulfill its mandate, AHRQ established the Effective Health Care (EHC) Program, the primary purpose of which is to develop research to inform the health care decisions of patients, consumers, providers and policymakers among others. A description of the EHC Program is available on the web site (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov).<br />The EHC Program consists of three primary components, each with a unique, yet interacting purpose. One component conducts syntheses of scientific evidence, another generates new scientific evidence and analytic tools, and the third component, the "John M. Eisenberg Clinical Decisions and Communications Sciences Center" translates scientific findings for various audiences. <br />The Eisenberg Center was created in 2005 and is a multi-disciplinary center that translates and disseminates the scientific information resulting from evidence synthesis or evidence generation activities into a form which is readily understandable and can be incorporated into decision making for various audiences, namely consumers, patients, providers and policy makers. Leveraging their unique skills, the Eisenberg Center assumes as their primary responsibility and objective to help end users understand complex scientific information, issues of balancing harms and benefits, numeracy and literacy issues, and cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The objective of the potential requirement will be to continue the established mission of the Eisenberg Center, i.e., facilitate access to and use of evidence-based clinical and health care delivery information and foster informed health care decisions by patients, providers and policymakers among others. The collective activities of the EC are intended to achieve the following objectives:<br />1. Increase awareness, access (cognitive and physical) and use of the EHC program research findings, its products, and activities.<br />&bull; Develop high quality translation and dissemination products that distill and interpret evidence synthesis and research findings for various audiences that can be used to inform health care decisions. <br />&bull; develop products and/or messages that can be adapted by others and integrated into their products or systems<br />&bull; Products tested with potential stakeholders to ensure understanding and intended options and action(s)<br />2. Facilitate program transparency and public engagement by maintaining the EHC web site which serves as the "public face" of the program<br />&bull; Conduct timely postings of products <br />&bull; Disseminate effective announcements inviting public comment and participation in activities<br />3. Increase the knowledge base in decision and communications science, and other relevant areas to inform decision making of multiple audiences (contribute to the state of the science)<br />&bull; Identify knowledge gaps in the translation and use of evidence by decision makers<br />&bull; Produce concept papers that address the knowledge gaps and other identified issues</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />Please be mindful that while there are IT components in this project, this is NOT and IT requirement. The project will be content-driven, supported by information technology.<br />There are eight (8) major tasks for this project, each having specific requirements and deliverables:</p>

There is no solicitation available at this time.     Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes are 517210, 517410 and 517919.  Respondents to this announcement must identify their business type (i.e., large, small, small and disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned small, HUB Zone certified small, or service disabled veteran-owned small business) in their response.  <br>  The Government is seeking a Managed Service Communications vendor to provide a network and services which will support PEO C3T assets, allowing them to send and receive information in tactical situations.  The Government provides a Strategic Communications Hub connected to a commercial integrated broadband IP satellite solution provider which extends the capabilities of the Department of Defense's core network.  The Government provides Baseband services including  Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router, Secure Internet Protocol Router, Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, CENTCOM Regional Intelligence Exchange System, Commercial and Net Equipment, Tactical Communications Platforms, Mobile Broadband Global Area Network Access Capabilities, SATCOM Terminals (Large, Very Small Aperture Terminal, Hand Held), Highly Mobile Communications, Very High Frequency, Ultra High Frequency, Ku, Ka, C, X, L, Land Mobile Radio, Mobile satellite services ( e.g., Satellite Phones, Secure Personal Digital Assistants, Cell Service Development.  <br>  To meet mission requirements, the Government requires a cost effective turn-key solution which includes:  <br>  1.	Multiple redundant teleports and multiple redundant satellites for a highly reliable satellite network.    <br>  2.	Redundant Network Peering Centers  <br>  3.	TAC (Technical Assistance Center) operating 24/7/365 to provide tier 1 technical support dedicated to rapid first call response.  <br>  4.	NOSC (Network Operations Security Center) operating 24/7/365 to provide support commissioning and to quickly resolve any network issues.  <br>  5.	No re-programming or re-configuration of equipment. Once IP addresses and phone numbers are assigned to a Node they can roam the network  <br>  6.	Ability to expand call available bandwidth on demand via one phone in support of emergency operations or increased  quote mark OP TEMPO quote mark   <br>  7.	Multiple Satellite Teleports connected via dedicated terrestrial circuits to a private MPLS based network (with redundant connections to each Satellite Teleport).  <br>  8.	Secure and redundant coverage of all 54 US States and Territories (redundant teleports, satellites and terrestrial connectivity to public (Internet, PSTN) and private (SIPRnet, NIPRnet) networks).  <br>  9.

An immediate and effective way to restore essential communications when they have been interrupted or lost.  <br>    <br>  There is an additional consideration with respect to Information Assurance (IA).  To ensure that Sensitive Information is protected, the Government adheres to Department of Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) (DoDI 5200.4).  The Government adheres to the National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation process (NIACAP) for all Federal Departments and agencies.  Typically a service provider must demonstrate past performance of the deployment of a global IP VSAT architecture that included an Authority to Connect (ATO) to a DISN Leading Edge Services (LES) without waiver and DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG) Authority To Operate (ATO) on SIPRNET.  In addition to the above, the implementation of Department of the Army Regulations such as the Army Regulation 25-2, November 14, 2003, Information Assurance (AR 25-2) will augment the requirements of the DITSCAP.  This includes a capability to support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES).  The Government provides a security plan addressing each network, hardware and software item of the DoD 8510.1-M, DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) Application Manual as part of its quotation, that addresses in detail its security solutions for supporting the security requirements. This requirement includes past performance of executing the Facility Security Clearance (FCL) process and of network operations and customer care in a cleared facility.  <br>    <br>  The contractor will be responsible for service assurance, delivery, availability/integrity of the network, as well as 24/7/365 proactive monitoring of the network. Proactive monitoring of the network must include a staffed Network Operations Security Center (NOSC). The contractor will also be responsible for operating a reactive trouble management and help desk capability. This capability will be a facility that provides full time (24x7x365) reactive trouble management and help desk functions. The contractor will manage this capability as a single point of contact tier 1 and tier 2 customer care and technical support staff operation. In order to be considered the contractor must provide technical, operational and support staff with current active secret or top secret clearances.  <br>    <br>  The contractor must be capable of providing both network services and user services.  Network services shall include satellite reach back, LMR, cellular, wired and wireless Ethernet and radio gateway. User services shall include SVoiP, VoIP, VTC, email, chat, white boarding, common operating picture (COP), incident command system, web portal and directory services.    <br>    <br>  The period of performance is expected to be a five (5) year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.           <br>    <br>  In conjunction with the above referenced services, the Government anticipates outleasing facility space pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.   2667. This facility space would be used to house contractor equipment which will be required for the provision of services.  <br>    <br>  Firms capable of performing the described services are invited to submit a description of their capabilities and experience in writing.  Responses shall be limited to 5 pages and should include, as a minimum, (1) evidence of relevant past experience; (2) related projects and/or existing systems, etc; and (3) business size as described above.     <br>    <br>  This sources sought synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals.

<DESC>This synopsis amendment references the previous notices concerning SSDD DOMS, W31P4Q-11-R-SSDD and W31P4Q-12-R-DOMS and clarifies information under W31P4Q-12-R-DOM2 concerning Joint Venture of qualified small business companies: An informal joint venture although it is not a legal entity may propose on any of the SSDD DOMS procurements. The previous amendment did not distinguish among formal populated, formal unpopulated and informal joint ventures because any of these type entities may propose on the SSDD DOMS procurements. <br>  <br> Because the SSDD DOMS procurements are small business set-asides, any offeror submitting a proposal in response to the solicitations must comply with the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. Therefore a joint venture, whether formal or informal, must comply with this provision as well.  <br>  <br> Any offeror submitting an offer as a joint venture entity, whether formal or informal, must comply with the requirements of 13 CFR 121.103(h) which requires the joint venture to be in writing and must do business under its own name, hence the requirement for joint venture entities (both formal and informal) to have its own name, CAGE code, DUNS and TIN.  That provision allows the Small Business Administration the ability to track the joint venture and its compliance with the requirement that a joint venture entity be awarded no more than three contracts over a two year period starting from the date of the award of the first contract.
