<DESC>United States Department of Transportation?s (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price Contract, the Period of Performance is 60 months after award to Claritas Inc for the renewal of Annual Site Licenses for Proprietary Software and Databases.  

This requirement is a non-competitive acquisition and no solicitation is available. The proposed acquisition is for Proprietary Software and Database for Market Segmentation in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Claritas Inc, the only source, in accordance with FAR 6.302.1.  The licenses include proprietary mapping software which allows NHTSA to translate data to maps which range in detail from zip code level to the entire country.  The PRIZM/NE database is composed of 66 lifestyle clusters which can be used to identify, categorize, or locate (by zip code, block, or tract) types of people who own particular types of vehicles ? for example, Sport Utility Vehicles, pickup trucks, used automobiles; people who commute in car pools, drive alone, walk to work, take public transportation. Other specific research directly related to NHTSA?s programs includes determining the characteristics of motorcycle riders, part time users of safety belts, people who have cell phones in their cars -- where they live, how to reach them with safety messages.  The determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government.  For additional information, please contact Ms. Sheketia Nettles via e-mail at   sheketia.nettles@dot.gov.

These items are for a specific service repair agreement for an existing Applied Biosystems API 5000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.  Only Applied Biosystems has access to specific diagnostic and control features on these instruments and thus other vendors cannot perform repairs and maintenance on these systems.  Applied Biosystems is the only vendor who has access to the core instrument control features and diagnostics on these systems.  

This unit was originally selected because it is critical for the development of assays for the detection of seafood toxins in shellfish and finfish and is needed in two different programs.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.  The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma has a requirement to implement a Strategic Management Process that will support the execution of the Flight Plan and associated business plans.  The Aeronautical Center's Director's Management Team (DMT) is evolving their strategic management processes to support their respective organizations and provide better alignment and execution of strategy and operations needed to operate more like a business.  Strategic Management of human capital and financial resources to meet both strategic and operational demands is increasingly important and necessary for efficient organizational change management.  An effective Strategic Management Process model consists of five components that allow strategy to be created, governed, cascaded, funded and managed effectively by the leadership team.  This new approach was approved by the DMT but will require assistance of contractors that are proficient in the new model and can train and facilitate leadership through the critical strategic development stages, implementation of the model and coaching to use the model effectively.  Additionally, the Aeronautical Center's parent organization, Regions and Center Operations (ARC) and their Management Team (ARCMT), is working on an improved planning model (SMP) to develop an executable strategic plan that supports the FAA Flight Plan.   The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of fulfilling this requirement.  It is contemplated that this requirement will be set-aside for Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, ($6.5M).   The FAA intends to have a resultant Firm-Fixed Price contract in place by 1 October 2007 or earlier.  All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages. No type font less than 11-point may be used.  Interested sources are required to provide the following information: 1.	Name and address of company 2.	Point of contact (include name, position within the company, telephone, and email address) 3.	A short narrative of the firm's capabilities that documents direct support with the FAA in developing and implementing Strategic Management Processes (SMP) and balanced scorecards 4.	A completed Business Declaration Form.  If subcontracting, partnering or teaming arrangements are anticipated to satisfy the requirements, then a separate Business Declaration form for each subcontractor, partner or team member must also be provided.   The FAA will not be liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.   All responses/submittals, including attachments, should be submitted electronically to the following email address:  deborah.getz@faa.gov.  All responses/submittals, including attachments should be submitted in either Microsoft Word, or portable document format (pdf).  Also please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10MB per e-mail, therefore responses/submittals may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail in order to be received. If you cannot respond electronically, please send one (1) copy to: Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center PO Box 25082 Attn:  Debby Getz, AMQ-320 Oklahoma City, OK  73125 All interested sources must provide their responses/submittals no later than 12:00PM, CST, July 24, 2007.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service, Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division has a requirement for a trawl vessel to conduct studies of gear performance and fish behavior in trawls, as well as studies of trawl modifications to reduce effects on seafloor habitat features.  The charter will consist of 10 days of charter, with an option for the Government to extend the contract for up to 12 additional charter days. This is a multi-year charter, which can be extended for similar work for any of the three subsequent years at the Government's option. Activities may include both pelagic and bottom trawling (the vessel may return to port to change gear if necessary). Some tows may result in capture of commercial amounts of groundfish.

<DESC>Description:  LK TECHNOLOGIES MODEL CMA2000 CYLINDRICAL MIRROR ANALYZER DESC: The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to LK Technologies Inc, Bloomington, IN for delivery to our site in Pittsburgh, PA for the following: 1.  Model CMA2000:  Double-pass optics mounted with linear mechanism on 2.75inch flange â€“ each. 2.  Model CMA2000 Control electronics and software.  Signal recovery is b analog method â€“ each. 3.  Model EG3000 electron gun mounted on 2.75inch CFF â€“ 1 each. 4.  Model EG3000 electron gun control electronics â€“ 1 each. 5.  Model EG3000 electron gun port aligner â€“ 1 each. This request is considered to be sole source to the LK Technologies because the CMA2000 is manufactured exclusively by them.  It is a unique instrument in its field as a retractable, small-size, double-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer of relatively high energy resolution (-1% depending on source size).  The double pass nature of the instrument allows high resolution and low background with typical signal-to-noise ratio greater that 500:1 for auger spectra.  The precise retraction of the instrument allows the analyzer to closely approach the sample specimen with 2-3 mm for optimal spectra, as necessary for compact analyzers.  This allows the emitted signal to be analyzed at the ideal CMA acceptance cone angle of 42 degrees necessary to eliminate angular aberrations and maximize signal.  The analyzer includes integral magnetic shielding in both the cone and cylinder area.  The compact size allows the analyzer to be fitted through a tubular diameter of approximately 1.40 inches.  The matching EG3000 Electron Gun provides a glancing incidence auger beam source for high surface sensitivity and spot size (-1 mm) matched to the acceptance of the CMA2000. The gun energy, beam current and spot size are all conveniently adjustable with the control unit. DELIVERY:  FOB Destination is required (all freight included).  The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation â€“ Commercial Items (JAN 1999) does not apply to this acquisition.  Instead, the following information will be used for evaluation of offers:  An award shall be made to the responsible offeror submitting a technically acceptable quote and offering the lowest evaluated price.

This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 52.219-19). This procurement is a set-aside and restricted to small businesses. The NAICS Code is 541310; the size standard is no more than $12,000,000 gross receipts over a three (3) year period or no more than $4,000,000 gross average receipts per year over a three (3) year time frame. Small, women-owned, and small disadvantaged, HUBzone, Veteran-Owed and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. 

Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balance aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including P-100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service). As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, security requirements, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards. All projects will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION - The project requires renovations and additions to the 1933 U.S. Post Office/Courthouse/Custom House, located at 413 Middle Street, New Bern, NC 28360-0000. The PO-CT-CH is located in the New Bern Central Business District.  This district is located within the historical district of New Bern, North Carolina.  It is a three-story Georgian Revival style building clad with red brick veneer (laid in common bond) with limestone trim and a granite base.  The steeply pitched roof is slate with copper-clad arched dormers at each end and a four-story wood cupola, painted white.  The PO-CT-CH is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The site is nearly level, elevated slightly above the street grade allowing drainage to the street. It is approximately 1.20 acres.  To the rear of the building there is an asphalt paved parking area (13 assigned spaces of the 53 total outside spaces) and loading dock.

The project proposes a complete renovation, alteration, and additions to the building in a manner sensitive to the historic nature and fabric of the building.  The program is to maximize the building’s capacity to function strictly as a court facility and provide for the 30-year needs of the court.  The project includes restoration of facade, improving ADA access, landscaping, roof repair, and building additions.  There are also requirements to: restore, repair and provide for blast protection at courtroom windows; install a new sprinkler system, fire alarm, exit signage and emergency lighting; abate and remove hazardous materials; replace the existing elevator, add two new elevators; and upgrade the HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems with a focus on reducing energy consumption.  Historic interiors will be restored, and major portions of tenant-inhabited space will be rebuilt to meet the customers’ requirements.

This project will provide superior workplaces for civilian federal employees, and shall serve as an example of successful historic preservation while making a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing character of the building. The design will follow the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservation Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements. GSA will contract separately during the design phase for Construction Manager Services.  The Construction Manager will be an active participant in the design process to provide (in addition to the A/E):  construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality, including energy efficiency, and constructability reviews.

SCOPE OF WORK - The facility will be designed using English units of measurement.  The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for clear and concise communication of the design intent to contractors who will construct the work.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  design development drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design (CAD) and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes the renovations and alterations to the existing building and related systems, site development and parking, client program requirements, and sustainable, energy-saving features.  The facility must be designed to meet the energy goal established by GSA.  The design is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities; EPACT 2005 compliance; P100 (Facilities Standard for the Public Buildings Service); adherence to the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards; the Courts Design Guide requirements; the U.S. Marshals design requirements and any other agency specific guidelines as part of the design.  The design of the facility shall include sustainable design and construction practices following the LEED format with a requirement for Certification and will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides.  There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties to their mutual benefit.

This building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Each design submission must be approved by the Regional Historic Preservation Officer, who will coordinate external review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106. Design submissions will include a preservation report with captioned photographs and relevant design details identifying preservation design issues and solutions as they are developed. Every effort will be made to avoid adversely effecting original materials and design in the buildings restoration or preservation zones identified in the BPP. Alteration or removal of original materials and design requires special justification and a Memorandum of Agreement with the SHPO. The selected A/E firm will assist GSA in obtaining any required MOA’s.

<DESC>Solicitation for Construction Manager (CM) Contract, General Services Administration, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Room 2135, Kansas City, Missouri  64131-3088.  Project Control Number RMO27140.  Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about May 15, 2007.  Time for completion:  365 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed.  No document charge or deposit is required.  Request list of those received RFP no later than ten days before submittals are due.  The geographic area is the City of St. Louis, the State of Missouri east of Columbia and the State of Iowa east of and including the metropolitan area of Des Moines.  Project involves:  for building construction projects having a construction cost less than $35,000,000.  CM services may include (1) Pre-Design Services (design programming, develop management plan, schedule, budget, studies); (2) Design Phase Services (design review, cost estimate review schedules, cost control); (3) Construction Phase Services (inspection to assure contract compliance, daily logs, progress reports, write and negotiate change proposals on behalf of the Government); (4) Post Construction Phase Services (converting red-lined as-built drawings to CAD drawings); and (5) other related services as required.  Typical projects include initial space alterations for tenant agencies, replacing/adding building system components (switchgear, roofs, boilers, chillers, HVAC equipment, and low voltage monitoring & Control systems such as fire alarm), and parking lot improvements.  The majority of the projects will have estimated construction costs in the range from $50,000 to $2,800,000.  Additional similar projects may be added to the contract if mutually acceptable to the Government and the CM.  The minimum contract amount to be awarded in the initial period (1-year) will be $5,000 per firm/joint venture and a minimum of $5,000 per firm/joint venture for each of the exercised option periods.  The maximum amount payable shall not exceed $2,800,000 per year or any exercised option periods.  The term of the contract is one year.  However, at the option of the Government and if the CM contractors performance is satisfactory, the contract may be extended for up to four additional one-year periods.  The successful CM contractor(s), including its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall not be eligible for award of a contract for A/E or construction services for these projects, nor serve as a subcontractor or consultant to any A-E or construction contractor for these projects.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Because of the critical role of the CM, the Government intends to use the best value concept in selecting a CM.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) contains the contract terms, scope of work and the proposal submittal requirements.  The RFP will be available o/a May 15, 2007.  Proposals shall be received in this office on or about June 14, 2007.  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Technical factors and price will be considered.  Technical evaluation factors, in relative order of importance, are (1) Qualifications of Organization; (2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and (3) Management Plan.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors; however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  Applicable NAICS Code is 236220.

The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.   It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.

Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address:  www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for any changes and/or conditions.

Please enter and maintain your representation and certification information via the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Once there you will find detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance under Help. To prepare for and register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) as identified in the CCR record.

<DESC>Description
Synopsis, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), will issue a solicitation for a full and open competitive procurement to provide Full Service Case Management with Electronic Monitoring Devices support to the Alternative to Detention (ATD) Enhanced Supervision/Reporting (ESR) Program.

The Alternatives to Detention Unit within ICE/DRO supervises aliens who are not detained in DHS custody.  Congress has specifically earmarked funding for ATD programs as one way of addressing the multitude of issues associated with illegal immigration and detention space issues.  To improve ATD functions, the ATD unit must implement contractor case management tasks to focus on home and office visits, electronic monitoring programs, and the acquisition of travel documents for departure from the United States.  The DHS/ICE/DRO Alternatives to Detention Unit is currently exploring new case management services and supervision technologies that can encompass DRO requirements, yet remain flexible in the selection and frequency of those services.  Services shall include monitoring and reporting program compliance, including positive and negative program termination, absconder rates, appearance at immigration hearings, and length of time in program modules and provide a cost effective solution versus secure detention to provide progressive supervision for aliens who are released from ICE custody to the community.  The supervision technologies are to include, but are not limited to, non-removable bracelets using radio frequency (RF) or GPS (active and passive) that operate either over landline or cellular technology, and multi-lingual telephonic reporting.

The Government intends to award a Fixed-Rate, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The contract resulting from this announcement will be a three (3) year contract.  The estimated value of this contract is $50,000,000 for the three (3) year period of performance.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) # HSCEOP-07-R-00033 is anticipated to be released on or about July 25, 2007.  Interested parties will be able to find the RFP, amendments, and other information related to this procurement on Fedbizopps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Award will be made on a best value basis.  Regardless of the competitive nature of the award, the contract awarded must be technically acceptable and meet cost reasonableness standards.  This is a full and open competitive procurement.  The North American Classification Standard (NAICS) code for this requirement is 335999.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already identified as potential sources from the NAMSA Source File, firms must be nominated to the bidders list with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms. Firms added to the bidders list will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the IFIB has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINE

Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 17 July 2007

NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to IXSEA, Inc.

Because PHINS meets the requirements for use on an RC model (Vol<300 cubic inches, power<15W, weight<10lbs) and its small size, use of other Photonic Inertial Navigation System will not interface with the current systems.

Statement of Work-- I. TITLE: Coffee Cup Sleeve Campaign to Promote  Pre-Renovation Education  II. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  October 1 - October 31, 2007 III. BACKGROUND: To fulfill its role in implementing Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Environmental Protection Agency developed the pre-Renovation Education (PRE) rule which requires persons  performing renovation of housing built before 1978 and who receive compensation for such work to provide a lead hazard information pamphlet to the owner and occupant of such housing prior to commencing the renovation.  This rule was intended to address hazards created by conducting renovations  which may result in lead poisoning in young children.  In 2007, there is a broad universe of contractors who are still unaware of their obligations to comply with the PRE rule.  In addition, today there are a substantial number of families with young children who are unaware of their rights (in  regards to lead notification) when dealing with contractors.

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration intends to award a sole source order to the Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) to provide HelpDesk tools; maintenance/support and network maintenance, for use in the performance of order HHSF223200650532G with HP for the ORA Consolidated Application HelpDesk (ORCAHD).  As the ORCAHD services are listed on HP's GSA schedule contract, and the HelpDesk tools are not, it is necessary to purchase them open-market.  The HelpDesk tools are necessary to support HP's proprietary systems and processes under the HelpDesk order and, therefore, HP is the only source who can satisfy FDA's requirements for the Helpdesk tools.  The HelpDesk tools will be reflected on the order under Other Direct Costs (ODCs).
The period of performance for this requirement is four (4) years, February 1, 2007 through January 31, 2011.  The base year for the ORCAHD order and the Helpdesk tools ODCs was February 1, 2006 through January 31, 2007, and the Option Year 1 order for ORCAHD order has been executed. 
This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  The NAICS code is 541511.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation document is available. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written response within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published announcement. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions & Grants Services, Attn: Michael McGrath, 5630 Fishers Lane HFA-500, Rockville, MD 20857. Information may also be faxed to (301) 827-7039. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the FDA will proceed with the sole source award to the Hewlett-Packard Company, 9737 Washingtonian Blvd, Gaithersburg, MD 20879-7337. The anticipated award date of this contract is on around July 27, 2007.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Description: 

1. The Projects: NOAA has a requirement for hydrographic surveying services to support its nautical charting mission. It is contemplated that two or more contracts will be awarded.  Although each contract will have a nationwide scope, vendors are particularly sought with specific capability to satisfy NOAA’s hydrographic survey needs in three distinct geographic areas: (1) the navigable waters of Alaska, including remote areas, bays, and harbors, (2) the Gulf of Mexico, and (3) all other navigable waters of the U.S., including the east coast, Pacific, the Great Lakes and U.S. territories.  Each indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract will have a five year term.  Task orders will be issued against the resulting contracts based on available funding.  The cumulative value of the task orders issued against the resulting contract(s) will not exceed $50 million. 

Task orders under the resulting contracts may consist of but are not limited to: 1) acquiring shallow water multibeam sounding data; 2) acquiring side scan sonar data; 3) acquiring vertical beam echosounder data; 4) determining positions and least depths on hazards to navigation; 5) installing, operating, and removing water level (tide) stations; 6) acquiring related supporting data (e.g. water level correctors, velocity of sound in the water column, vessel motion correctors, bottom sediment samples, etc.); 7) processing the data, including tidal tabulation, computation of tidal datums, tidal zoning determination, applying water level, vessel motion, and velocity of sound correctors to determine the true depths, correlating sonar targets, and compiling reports, final smooth sheets, and digital data; and 8) performing quality control during data acquisition and processing; and 9) the delivery of the data, reports, and sheets to NOAA for archival and application to the nautical charts and associated nautical products.  

All work shall be performed to NOAA specifications and the data provided in NOAA specified formats.  See http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/hsd/specs/specs.htm for typical technical specifications and a description of the deliverables. The project instructions will tailor these specifications for each task order issued.  A quality control plan will be a contract requirement.  Firms responding are encouraged to review the technical specifications and the description of deliverables before responding to this announcement. 

The resulting contracts will permit a Government COTR or observer to be present during shipboard operations.  If the contractor conducts vessel operations overnight, the contractor will be required to provide meals and accommodations to the Government COTR or observer.  

2. Selection Criteria:  Firms must provide sufficient surveying vessel(s) and equipment and sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to ensure expeditious execution of work assignments.  Utilization of small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small businesses will be one of the evaluation factors in the selection process.  To be considered for selection, a firm must demonstrate surveying experience in the types of surveys stated above and have on payroll at least two hydrographers and a tides/water level specialist. The two hydrographers must each have a minimum of three years experience in hydrographic surveying and demonstrated experience in surveying using shallow water multibeam sonar system, vertical beam echosounder, side scan sonar system and interpreting the data.  The tides/water level specialist must have demonstrated experience in measurement of tides and water levels, tidal datums, and tidal zoning and their application to hydrographic surveying.  

Firms must show the availability of a suitable survey vessel(s) that complies with applicable U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, OSHA, and other federal regulations; data acquisition and processing systems; vertical beam echosounder system(s); shallow water multibeam sonar system(s) capable of detecting contacts measuring 2m x 2m x 1m high; side scan sonar system(s) that can detect a 1m x 1m x 1m target and with the capability to record data digitally; GPS surveying equipment for establishing horizontal control; differential GPS equipment for vessel positioning; water level measurement gauges; and equipment for determining velocity of sound in the water column.  

Evaluation factors, in descending order of importance, are:  (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (personnel and equipment); (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules; (5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of work in diverse types of localities in the U.S.; (6) Proposed plans and goals to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities on this project to small, small-disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned  small business concerns.  Evaluation criteria #6 will not apply to small business firms because subcontracting plans are not required from those concerns pursuant to FAR 19.702(b).  

An adjectival method will be used to rate each factor:

Exceptional:  The submission exceeded evaluation standards; has no significant weaknesses; reflects a high probability of satisfying the requirements.

Acceptable:	The submission met evaluation standards; any weakness can be readily corrected; reflects a good probability of satisfying the requirements.

Marginal:  The submission failed to meet minimum evaluation standards; has significant, but correctable deficiencies; reflects a low probability of satisfying the requirements. 

Unacceptable:  The submission failed to meet the minimum standards; has a low probability of satisfying the requirements; reflects significant performance risk. 

Subsequent to the initial evaluation, those firms that are considered most highly qualified may be scheduled for interviews.   

Responding firms are required to state whether they are small, small disadvantaged business, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small business. Responding firms are encouraged to use small business concerns in a meaningful manner in the execution of this project.  Large business firms should demonstrate their commitment and discuss proposed plans to provide subcontracting opportunities to the small business community in the performance of this project.  

Specific abilities and disciplines required include (but are not limited to):  Project Manager, Hydrographer, Tides/Water Level Specialist, Land Surveyor, and GIS Specialist (Geographers/Cartographer/Geospatial Data Analyst).  

Firms should indicate their experience using a shallow water multibeam survey system and an outline of how the Prime contractor will manage their team to ensure that quality products are delivered to NOAA.  

For evaluation factor (3) Capacity, a list of key personnel demonstrating their availability for the project considering other commitments and major equipment available for project assignment must be provided along with other pertinent data.  

3. Submission:  Responsible sources may submit a response for consideration by NOAA.  Prime contractors shall respond to this announcement for their teams.  The prime contractor shall submit one original plus three copies of its team’s response to this synopsis.  The response shall consist of Standard Form 330 (SF330) and other material not to exceed 100 pages in total.  Copies of the SF330, instructions for completing the SF330, and continuation pages can be obtained through the General Services Administration’s forms directory at:  http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do  
Each original submission and copy shall be bound (e.g. 3-ring binder, GBC comb binding, etc.).  

Carefully read and follow the instructions printed on the SF330.  The team’s qualifications for this project should be presented in Part I of the form.  Responding firms must submit a separate Part II – General Qualifications of the SF330 for each firm that will be part of the team proposed for this contract.  Evaluation criteria (3) Capacity, (5) Locality, and (6) Subcontracting as defined above should be addressed in Part I, Section H, Block 30 of the SF330. 

Responses (SF330s) are due to the following address no later than 2:00 pm eastern daylight savings time, November 8, 2004: U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, NOS/NMFS/OAR Acquisition Management Division (OFA65), Attn: Linda Brainard, 1305 East-West Hwy., SSMC#4 Station 7607, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Ceramics Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Canberra Industries, Inc., for the purchase of Multiport II and NIM modules for the Canberra SiLi and GeLi Detectors.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes a Canberra SiLi detector and a Canberra GeLi detector.  The Multiport II and NIM modules required will be used to acquire the pulses that come from the detectors, translate them into an energy spectrum, and simultaneously pulse process and ultimately count these pulses and turn them into real spectra/data that can be represented either as a multi-channel analyzer trace or plotted intensity as a function of photon energy.  The entire 4-channel pulse counting electronics specified must fit into a single NIM bin.  They must be able to handle extremely high count rates 250,000 counts per channel and minimal dead time and no loss of resolution.  Each of the 4 channels must be analyzed and displayed simultaneously on a single PC display that is also pre-existing equipment.  The entire package must be pin for pin compatible with Canberra detectors already in operation.  This includes the amplifiers to power the detectors as well as the input for the multichannel analyzers.  Therefore, the Multiport II and NIM modules must be 100 percent compatible with the existing detectors.  Canberra Industries, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the modules that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 24, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Adequate bandwidth will be provided to users who require it to process and evaluate images needed to provide the best health care to our veterans.  The VA is presently embarking on strategy to implement and govern an Enterprise Architecture (according to OMB A-130). The criticality of the architecture makes it necessary to test all major applications before deployment begins. The estimated value of purchasing the Cisco hardware is estimated at $8,887,103.00.  This action is to justify the use of a Brand Name Description as described in FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. Cisco equipment can be purchased from a number of agent contractors at a variety of prices. This product will be solicited utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) as specified by VA directive. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 12:00 pm CST on July 17, 2007.

The determination to open brand name competition based on responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. No additional synopsis information will be published, and a solicitation will only be issued to SEWP IV contract holders, regardless of the Government's brand name decision. Responses should be emailed to melissa.fauber@va.gov or faxed to 512-326-6028.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED PROCUREMENT under NAICS Code 541330 (SIC 8711) with a size standard of $4,500,000.00.  This is an indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contract.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), Engineer Research and Development C enter (ERDC) is responsible for authorizing and maintaining the nations navigable waterways. Maintenance of the waterways is to address a safety issue, or to improve the channel and allow larger, deeper-drafted ships to call at the port. The services requ ired to perform these duties are of a very specialized nature and the COE requires a model study to evaluate nearly all proposed channel modifications. Often the model study involves real-time ship simulation which means that ship movements on the simulato r require the same amount of time as they do in real life. Being real-time allows professional mariners to operate the simulator as they would a real ship. Usually the simulation work is done on the ERDC Ship/Tow Simulator. However, occasionally ERDC overs ees work done at private simulators at other locations. The contractor will be responsible for providing simulation pilot services for the ERDC located in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The simulation projects will be for a variety of ports nationwide and the pilots for each study must be licensed for the harbor or wa terway being studied. This includes travel costs which will be negotiated with each task order. Mariner simulation duties fall into two categories - validation and testing. Validation is the exercise during which the existing condition simulation model is adjusted until real-life conditions are replicated on the simulator. Testing is simulation of bo th proposed and existing conditions.   Two types of mariners are involved in a deep-draft channel design simulation project. These are ship pilots and docking pilots (sometimes referred to as docking masters). Ship pilots are licensed for particular port a nd handle all vessel traffic into and out of the port. Docking pilots are employed by the tug companies and are in control while the ships are under tug assistance. Docking pilots are typically found only in east coast ports. Ship pilots handle docking dut ies elsewhere. The ERDC also conducts simulation projects for shallow-draft vessels.  In this case, the mariners involved in the study will be towboat captains. The simulation duties of all mariners are essentially the same. They are to travel to ERDC or a private facili ty where ERDC is overseeing simulation modeling and operate the simulator as they would a vessel in real-life.  The award will be made to the vendor who proposes the best value to the Government considering Technical, Past Performance, and Price evaluation factors.  If you are not registered in the CCR, an award CANNOT be made to your company.  You may register elec tronically at http://www.ccr.gov.  Registering electronically will expedite the registration process.  The solicitation will be issued on or about July 25, 2007 and proposals are due on or about August 28, 2007 not later than 4:00p.m. at the Vicksburg Cons olidated Contracting Office, ATTN:  Cynthia Brown, 4155 Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS  39183-3435, at (601) 631-7291 or email at Cynthia.m.brown@mvk02.usace.army.mil.

<CONTACT>Debby Getz, (405) 954-8963
<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma has a requirement to implement a Strategic Management Process that will support the execution of the Flight Plan and associated business plans.  The Aeronautical Center's Director's Management Team (DMT) is evolving their strategic management processes to support their respective organizations and provide better alignment and execution of strategy and operations needed to operate more like a business.  Strategic Management of human capital and financial resources to meet both strategic and operational demands is increasingly important and necessary for efficient organizational change management.  An effective Strategic Management Process model consists of five components that allow strategy to be created, governed, cascaded, funded and managed effectively by the leadership team.  This new approach was approved by the DMT but will require assistance of contractors that are proficient in the new model and can train and facilitate leadership through the critical strategic development stages, implementation of the model and coaching to use the model effectively.  Additionally, the Aeronautical Center's parent organization, Regions and Center Operations (ARC) and their Management Team (ARCMT), is working on an improved planning model (SMP) to develop an executable strategic plan that supports the FAA Flight Plan.   The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of fulfilling this requirement.  It is contemplated that this requirement will be set-aside for Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, ($6.5M).   The FAA intends to have a resultant Time and Materials/Labor Hour contract in place by 1 October 2007 or earlier.  All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages. No type font less than 11-point may be used.  Interested sources are required to provide the following information: 1.	Name and address of company 2.	Point of contact (include name, position within the company, telephone, and email address) 3.	A short narrative of the firm's capabilities that documents direct support with the FAA in developing and implementing Strategic Management Processes (SMP) and balanced scorecards 4.	A completed Business Declaration Form.  If subcontracting, partnering or teaming arrangements are anticipated to satisfy the requirements, then a separate Business Declaration form for each subcontractor, partner or team member must also be provided.   The FAA will not be liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.

This event is scheduled for 24 July 2007 from 0800 - 1200 PST at the A-8 Auditorium of The Aerospace Corporation, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245.  Following the presentation and general Q&A session, the Space Superiority Operations Support and Sustainment Division (SYSW/OS) will conduct one-on-one discussions with all interested Industry Day attendees.  Each Prime contractor will be authorized 6-8 personnel at the forth coming Industry Day.  One of the attendees must be a security person. One-on-one sessions will take place on the 24th immediately after the Industry Day presentation and if needed the 25th & 26th.   Each one-on-one session will be 45 minutes unless there is a need to shorten the sessions to 30 min due to the number of interested contractors.

On 26 January, 2007, the initial Industry Day for SYSW Sustainment Support was conducted.  Since then the government has revised its strategy and acquisition approach. The original approach was to award multiple contracts through an IDIQ contract and is now revised to award a single contract. This industry day, the Government team will brief attending contractors on the updated goals, requirements and strategy for acquiring sustainment support services for the various SMC/SYSW ground-based deployable systems.  The programs supported by this contract include: the Counter Communication System (CCS) Family of Systems, the Space Test and Training Range (STTR) Family of Systems, the Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Family of Systems and Rapid Reaction Capabilities (RRCs), along with any future deployable SYSW system whose sustainment requirements are in-line with the scope of the SCDS contract.  The SCDS contract will be managed by SYSW/OS. Detailed system descriptions for SCDS programs will be presented at the Industry Day.

The sustainment requirements of the SCDS contract are broken into five functional areas: 1) Depot Support, 2) Studies & Analysis, 3) System Upgrades and Modifications, 4) Rapid Reaction Capability Transition to Operational Systems, and 5) Organizational Level Maintenance.  Depot support consists of the following: depot and sustainment engineering (D&SE), repairable and disposable item management, stock, storage and issuance of spares, hardware and software maintenance and repairs, sparing level analysis, etc.  Studies and analysis projects in support of the basic program mission includes, but is not limited to: analyses to reduce life cycle costs, improving availability and maintainability, the replacement of obsolete or /unsupportable equipment, the evaluation of future capability enhancements, preplanned product improvement (P3I), etc.  System upgrades and modifications may include the development, test, production and installation of system upgrades.  The transition of RRCs to operational systems includes activities such as developing technical orders (TOs), drawing packages, performing provisioning analysis and procuring spares and support equipment, and configuration management and standardization of hardware and software. Organization Level Maintenance is defined as on-site maintenance support at operational units.  

All attending contractors shall submit a Statement of Capabilities describing their qualifications to be the Prime contractor for the SCDS effort which includes information regarding experience with establishing public/private partnerships for depot support, contractor experience with transportable/deployable ground systems and information demonstrating compliance with the aforementioned security requirements. Each potential Prime must submit a Statement of Capability to Mr. Dwight Taeza at Dwight.taeza@losangeles.af.mil no later than the close of business on 6 July 2007.  

Responses from small and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.

To attend the Industry Day each potential Prime shall submit a SF86 for each attendee. All attendees must have a current TS/SSBI and be briefed SI/TK. In addition all attendees must meet Tier 1 Special Access Programs adjudication standards. In those instances where an attendee is currently accessed to Air Force Special Access Programs sponsored by SAF/AAZ or SMC/SY, contractors shall submit only a Personnel Access Request (PAR) provided the individual has a current TS/SSBI. The justification will state "Access is requested to attend Sustainment Industry Day on 24 July." Block 1 of the PAR will be left blank. SF86's and PARs must be received NLT 11 July 2007. Any submissions which do not meet Tier 1 adjudication standards will be processed last and probably will not be completed in time to facilitate attendance. If there are any questions contact Mr. Gerald Crafton at (310) 416-1591 or gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil. 

All approved attendees will be indoctrinated at the Industry Day and details of the RFP and acquisition strategy will be disclosed at that time. Those potential Primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the RFP. Contractors may submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) at the same time the personnel security paperwork is submitted. Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort. A full fledge DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS is required. If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and it is currently accredited by another agency, that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort. Contact Mr. Crafton regarding information/paperwork that will be required. SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While possessing an accredited SCIF is not a requirement to participate in the 24 July 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified SCDS RFP without having a secure SCIF to store the information in. 

Each potential Prime team will be authorized a total of 40 quotas for the RFP effort.  SYSW Security will not process any more than 6-8 access requests until an approved facility is established and the 24 July 07 Industry Day has been completed. If you submit more than 8 access packages prior to industry day, identify the eight that will be attending the industry day as they will be processed first.

All attendees must send a Visit Notification to SYSW. All attendees must have a current SSBI/SBPR and be briefed SI/TK.

Attendees who are currently accessed to AF SAPS may send there Visit Notifications to us through Special Access Channels.

Attendees who are briefed SI/TK but are not currently accessed to AF SAPS must send there Visit via JPAS. Send the Certification to JPAS SMO Code "SYS Wing". The Technical POC is Maj Russ Swart. Phone # 310-416-1590.

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James H. Gill SMC/PK.  You can reach him at James.Gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

DECLARATION:  This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

<DESC>On June 18, 2007, the Missile Defense Agency, Targets and Countermeasures Program Office announced that the Low Cost Assessment Targets (LCAT) final RFP release would be delayed until September 2007.  The delay allowed the agency the opportunity to further refine the requirements based on the Agency's current mission projections and Industry comments on the draft RFP.   The requirements assessment and further analysis of alternatives have lead to a determination that potential requirements are insufficient to support continuation of the acquisition.  As a result, the Draft Request for Proposal HQ0147-07-R-0003 entitled 'Low Cost Assessment Targets,' is hereby cancelled and a final RFP will not be forthcoming.  The second Industry Day forecasted for August 2007 will not be held.  Industry's interest and feed back regarding the procurement has been most appreciated, and has greatly benefited the Agency's understanding of the market capabilities.

<DESC>Amendment:  Please note the additional information in paragraph 2 regarding the location.


The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses that can provide the following service:  The Contractor shall have knowledge of preparing and administering payments to research volunteers and be knowledgeable about the issues associated with payment of said volunteers.  The Contractor shall support the participation of American Indians and non-Indians who volunteer for approved medical research projects conducted by the NIDDK.  The Contractor shall be responsible for paying these individuals, including writing and issuing checks, maintaining payment files, and satisfying the requirements of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to reporting earned income.

The Phoenix Epidemiology & Clinical Research Branch (PECRB) conducts research related to Type 2 diabetes and its complications.  Many of the diseases of interest to NIDDK are more common among American Indians than in the general U.S. population.  The services of a contactor are required to facilitate the participation of the volunteers.  PECRB has permanent research facilities in two locations:  1) the Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC) in Phoenix, Arizona; and 2) the Hu Hu Kam Memorial Hospital (HHK) on the Gila River Indian Community at Sacaton, Arizona. Prompt payment is essential for both the recruitment and retention of volunteers as study participants. Consequently, on-site payment to volunteers on the day of hospital discharge or at the completion of outpatient studies is a requirement of the contract. 

This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the service as listed above and to submit a capability statement.  The capability statement will assist the Government to determine, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b), whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the small business programs described above.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 522310 with a size standard of $6.5M.  All respondents are requested to identify their firm?s size and type of business.  Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide a capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government?s requirements for the above.  The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 20 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above.  Your capability statement must be received at the following address by no later than close of business (5:00p.m. local time at designated location) on July 16, 2007.  The address is:  NIH, 6707 Democracy Blvd., Room 742, Bethesda, MD 20817.  Responses by fax or e-mail WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

<CONTACT>Gregory Newsom, Contracting Officer, Phone 2023071962, Fax 2023071933, Email gregory.l.newsom@usdoj.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) intended to identify solutions, technologies, and best practices that will allow the implementation of a single or multi-vendor Enterprise Web Gateway for the Department of Justice (DOJ) that will meet the needs of the Department's wide ranging business functions and organizational distributions.  The system will be located at the Department's Rockville Data Center (RDC) and will be based on the use of web proxy servers to enforce acceptable network use policies of the DOJ and to provide security, protection against malware/spyware, and web caching services.  

This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information that may lead to a Department-wide Enterprise Web Gateway solution.  Specifically, this RFI is seeking submission of product/solution/best practice descriptions that would allow DOJ to make an informed decision on how to proceed with the identification, selection and implementation of single or multi-vendor Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products.  The purpose of these COTS products is to provide a common solution that can be centrally managed with a minimum of customization and leveraged by all DOJ Components, while minimizing the cost to acquire and operate.  The government encourages creativity and forward thinking in response to this RFI. Currently, DOJ is using a suite of software-based COTS applications that provide web page caching, Uniform Resource Locator (URL) filtering of web content (including malware and spyware), and antivirus (AV) scanning of web traffic out of a centralized data center for approximately 100,000 DOJ users.  The Department is seeking to replace these software-based products and the hardware they run on with security-hardened, appliance-based products from a single or multiple vendors.

The Enterprise Web Gateway solution shall require a minimum of customization, and rely on the manufacturer's ability to provide secure and reliable updates to the URL filtering and AV signatures used to manage the solution.  The solution will consist of single or multi-vendor security-hardened appliances used to block offensive web content, intercept computer viruses and other hostile content (malware and spyware) served from remote web pages, and cache certain web content to increase internet bandwidth efficiency.  

Additional details of the RFI will post in Amendment/Modification 1 to this notice.

<DESC>The Director for Operations, Joint Staff (J3), Director for Operations, Plans, Logistics, and Engineering, US Joint Forces Command (J4), and Joint Deployment and Logistics Group, US Joint Forces Command (J9), by direction of Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Readiness, the Director of the Joint Staff, and the Deputy Commander, US Joint Forces Command, conducted a Force Management Integration Project (FMIP) Team Kick-off Meeting, 8-9 May, 2007. The purpose of that kick-off meeting was to develop and execute a plan for integrating and synchronizing policy, processes, authoritative databases, and technology for contingency and execution force sourcing. That plan would enable the improved management of global forces. During the meeting, participants identified required products, developed a plan of action and milestones, and established an aggressive phased approach for conducting three focused workshops to sequentially address capability gaps in three areas. This request for information is soliciting input from industry and academia for one of those shortfall capability gaps ? development of a force provider global sourcing collaborative workflow staffing capability.

The workshop membership comprised of government representatives from OSD, the Joint Staff, the Service headquarters, and force providing combatant commands and their component organizations, will meet the week of 10-13 July to develop a capability description document for this needed capability. The end state is to identify a long-term technical solution to achieve a global sourcing collaborative staffing capability and this RFI offers industry and academia an opportunity to ensure the workshop membership understands what technologies may exist that can contribute to a force provider global sourcing collaborative workflow staffing capability. The final capability description document will be turned over to DISA by this October for follow-on development, and the Joint Combat Capability Developer (JCCD) to be included into the net-enabled command capability (NECC) family of systems. The final technical solution may be a single application or a collection of integrated tools, along with any necessary hardware support. ***NOTE:  This is a Request for Information and NOT a Sources Sought Notice.***

<SUBJECT>R -- Intent to Award Contract Sole Source
<DESC>Notification of Intention to Award a Sole Source Contract.
 
The Agency for International Development?s Mission to Ghana is planning to award a contract without competition to Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International to manage the Ghana Responsible Mining Alliance. The basis for this award is the FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. 
 
I.	Background

On May 24, 2006, USAID/Ghana entered into a global development alliance (GDA) with Gold Fields Ghana Limited (Gold Fields) and Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (Newmont). The Alliance is called the Ghana Responsible Mining Alliance. The Alliance joins the industry and development expertise, experience, and resources of the two companies and USAID in a commitment to build prosperous, healthy and lasting communities in the mining areas of Asutifi and Wassa West districts of Ghana, and develop a roadmap for responsible mining. Through the Alliance, Gold Fields and Newmont, with USAID, are moving beyond contributions to investments in sustainable development, including local government technical capacity to support local economic growth, and improvements in how they do business in mining communities.

II.	Discussion 

To develop the initial work plan for the Alliance?s activities, Gold Fields contracted with RTI. Gold Fields selected RTI for the contract based on RTI?s sound, technical expertise. For one, RTI had intimate knowledge of local government and community participation dynamics in Ghana. RTI had participated in the Government Accountability Improves Trust (GAIT II) project from August 1, 2004 ? April 30, 2006, leading the local government segment of the GAIT II project. GAIT II works both in Asutifi and Wassa West districts. Therefore, RTI had worked closely with each of the local governments and had a good sense of the community make up and the various stakeholders involved. As a result, RTI had extensive knowledge of both the targeted districts and the peculiar dynamics of each. Secondly, RTI brought a general knowledge of mining to the table. Being aware of USAID?s discussion with Gold Fields and Newmont in 2005, RTI had presented to USAID thoughts on how the Alliance could be developed in Ghana; what elements it would contain; and how it could be managed. In their submissions, they demonstrated a real knowledge of the sector and the challenges that the Alliance would face. Thirdly, RTI had also already conducted Environmental, Social, and Governance Analysis of Gold Mining more broadly, developing a short issues paper that demonstrated their technical knowledge of the sector. Their analysis drew on issues addressing the sector more broadly and demonstrated a breadth of knowledge on the sector. Finally, the technical adviser RTI proposed and fielded had been the local government adviser for the GAIT project for 1 ? years and also had extensive local government experience in the US, including working for local governments that had to deal directly with mining issues.

The draft work plan that RTI developed was technically sound and satisfied the requirements of each of the Alliance partners. The Alliance was able to use it to articulate the vision of the Alliance to all relevant stakeholders. 

As the next step in the Alliance development, Newmont contracted with RTI to assist in the organization of three stakeholder workshops, one in Accra, one in Asutifi, and one in Wassa West. These workshops were used to present the vision of the Alliance to all the concerned stakeholders and seek their technical input to allow the Alliance to finalize the work plan and begin implementation of activities envisioned under the Alliance. Newmont contracted RTI based on the same reasons articulated above for the initial work plan coupled with knowledge that RTI had further acquired through the development of the draft work plan. RTI had already provided a number of critical insights in their development of the work plan and was able to bring this expertise in planning and delivering the stakeholder workshops.

The three work shops were held in September 2006 and generated significant engagement and input from stakeholders. They brought a number of stakeholders into the discussion; highlighted the need to put local government in the lead and explicitly tie them to the Alliance; and identified a number of issues that had not been fully addressed in the Alliance that would need further study and consideration to allow the work plan to be finalized. Newmont modified their contract with RTI to ask RTI to pull all the issues together that emerged from the workshops and put them together in a comprehensive workshop report that could be shared with all stakeholders and be used as the basis for follow-up work on the Alliance. This included refining an organogram for the management of the Alliance and thinking about how the Alliance would be managed. 

RTI put together an excellent workshop report that succinctly captured all the issues emerging from the three work shops and proposed a possible structure for the future management of the Alliance that would put local government in the lead. All of the Alliance partners are very pleased with the workshop report and have been impressed by the technical leadership that RTI has demonstrated thus far.

Based on RTI?s performance to date, the Alliance partners are unanimous that RTI has unique skills and knowledge that make them the one responsible source to manage the activities of the Alliance. Through its work to date under the Alliance funded by Gold Fields and Newmont respectively, they have established this position and have the full confidence of all the Alliance partners. USAID?s Alliance partners do not believe that any other organization has comparable knowledge and expertise required to manage the Alliance in a way that would allow it to get going quickly and smoothly in a way that would be mindful of all stakeholder concerns.

The Alliance partners have agreed that USAID should contract for the management of the Ghana Responsible Mining Alliance. The two mining companies agree that USAID has the knowledge and the expertise required to execute and manage the contract. The value of USAID?s contract with RTI will be less than $450,000. The mining companies will each provide additional funds through separate contracts with RTI that will be referenced in an addendum to the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

 
RTI will be asked to perform the following:

1.	Manage day-to-day Alliance performance, operations, communication and reporting.

2.	Lead efforts to engage local government, civil society and other critical stakeholders to ensure broad buy-in to Alliance activities. This would include helping to engage and seek avenues for resolution of issues that would come up as the Alliance moves forward.

3.	Serve as implementing partner, including provision of technical leadership and delivery of activities for Objective 3 (promotion of best practices) and some activities under Objective 1 (local governance), as defined by the Alliance Secretariat. 

4.	Technical guidance for set-up and ongoing operation of Asutifi and Wassa West District Teams and Alliance Technical Advisory Committee 

5.	Support to the Alliance Secretariat and Steering Committee, including technical guidance for set-up and ongoing operation. Includes:
?	Preparation and monitoring of Alliance work plan and associated activity schedules and performance plan
?	Development and technical assistance to support implementation of an Alliance communication strategy for internal and external communication, considering at minimum news media relations, print publications, use of the web
?	Identification of opportunities for technical collaboration, joint work with the Ghana development community (examples: GTZ and World Bank)

Expected Results and Activities
Activities will be designed to support the following expected results in Asutifi and Wassa West Districts. Results are organized by Alliance objectives 1-3. 

Objective 1: Strengthened Local Government
1.	Strengthened two-way communication mechanisms 
2.	Strengthened local problem-solving mechanisms
3.	Integrated District Assembly budget
4.	Local action on the Extractive Industries Transparency Index (EITI)

Objective 2: Enhanced economic opportunity through local private sector
1.	Conduct external evaluation of the following programs in Asutifi District: Livelihood Enhancement and Community Empowerment Program (LEEP), Ahafo Agribusiness Growth Initiative (AAGI), and SME Linkages
2.	Conduct external evaluation of the following program in Wassa West District: Sustainable Community Empowerment and Economic Development Program (SEED)

Objective 3: Promotion of responsible mining practices
1.	Improved practices for community participatory monitoring 
2.	Improved practices for supporting Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security
3.	Improved practices for Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level

RTI has extensive knowledge of the Alliance coming into this activity and coupled with the tremendous amount of experience and insight that RTI has gathered in developing the draft work plan, leading the three stakeholder workshops, and compiling the results from the workshops into a comprehensive document, makes RTI the one responsible source able to manage the activities under the Alliance. The Alliance is a complex arrangement that bring together two mining companies and USAID. It is a delicate partnership that brings together people from very different corporate cultures. Mutual trust and a strong working relationship are critical to its success. RTI has demonstrated thus far that they have the unique skills and expertise required to manage the Alliance and have the full confidence of each of the three Alliance partners. It is extremely unlikely that USAID could get another contractor that enjoyed this same level of confidence from the three partners. Going with another partner could cause USAID to risk losing the estimated $8.75 million in contributions that the mining companies have committed to investing in the Alliance at this point as the Alliance partners may be reluctant to invest these level of resources with a manager that they do not trust. It is extremely likely that a competition would ultimately lead to the Alliance partners selecting RTI as there is no other contractor with comparable experience and expertise in this area. The competition would simply delay the Alliance activities getting underway and as a result, risk alienating both critical stakeholders.

Program Description
The purpose of this RFI is to obtain propulsion contractor input to enable AFRL to define the best approach for an efficient and successful development program.  AFRL is interested in technical concepts and program approaches that will insure program success while meeting Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) Hydrocarbon Boost Phase III goals.  The objectives of this future contracted effort are to provide AFRL with approaches to attain IHPRPT Phase III goals through the use of highly innovative technologies using LOX/CH4 as the propellants.  Of particular interest are concepts which develop new or novel cycles that help achieve the IHPRPT Phase III goals.  Technologies must be scalable to large booster class engines.  In addition, it is desirable for technologies developed to be applicable to the rocket portion of Scramjet-Rocket Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine.

The contract type to be awarded for the program is not yet determined.  It is anticipated that the solicitation(s) will result in the award of one or more cost-plus/cost-reimbursement type contract(s).  Maximum possible funding for a contract or multiple contracts is up to twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00), and the program can be up to 8 years in duration from authority to proceed (ATP).


Questions 
In order for the government to adequately assess and improve the requirements for solicitation and the resulting contracted program/programs, candidate contractors are encouraged to provide responses to the following questions.  Answers to these questions should be in addition to other contractor comments and suggestions provided. 

1.	What are possible concept(s) to achieve the goals stated in the problem statement of this RFI?  Suggest how those concepts would be explored. 

2.	Are there any new technologies from related or unrelated applications that could be applied to the demonstration program?  Identify these technologies and the risks associated with incorporating these concepts into a contracted program.

3.	Describe how meeting RBCC requirement will impact the system design.

4.	Can a hardware demonstration be completed with the funding available?  What hardware quantities, number and types of tests and fabrication/rework schedule would you recommend prior to and during demonstration testing to reduce program risk, maintain schedule and insure program success?

5.	What is your baseline overall program schedule and basic estimated ROM funding requirements per government fiscal year?

6.	Discuss major design and demonstration test issues and risks to be considered in a contracted program.  Are there contract and program recommendations that can reduce the schedule and/or cost and still meet the demonstration test program objectives?

7.	Would an oral or written proposal provide the most efficient means of communicating your concept(s)?  If oral, how much time would be required?  If written how many pages would be required?

8.	The existence of an Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plan (ARPP) will be an evaluation criteria used for proposal selection.  An ARPP will be required from the company or companies contracted as a result of the solicitation to be created.  Please comment how this requirement will impact your company.  Details on ARPPs can be provided by Ms. Crystal Klemmer upon request.

9.	Please describe any additional technical and programmatic suggestions that would make this contracted program more efficient and meet the USAF needs and program goals.  Comment as necessary on anything considered important.

<SUBJECT>15 -- Continued Airworthiness Program
<DESC>The Forest Service is requesting comments and questions on our aircraft continued airworthiness program.  Attached is language being contemplated for the 2008 airtanker solicitation.  Please send all written comments and questions to the following by July 24, 2008.  If further information is required, please do not hesitate to call me at (208) 397-5695.

The Contractor will define, establish, document, and implement a Continued Airworthiness Program (CAP) to predict and prevent fatigue separations.  

The CAP must: contain: 

?	Define and describe the contractor?s airworthiness program and how it meets the exhibit requirements.

?	Insure that the aircraft has been issued a Standard or Restricted certificate by the FAA.

?	Meet the intent of developing a maintenance and inspection program specific to their airtanker fleet.

?	Submit documents for FAA approved Instructions for Continued Airworthiness in accordance with FAR 25.1529 at Amendment Level 54 or later, and be based on the FAA Type certification. 

Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) are maintenance actions defined by the TC or STC holder in accordance with 14 CFR 25.1529 and delivered with the airplane or provided by the manufacturer in accordance with ? 21.509. ICA?s are documented information that includes applicable methods, inspections, processes, procedures and airworthiness limitations.


?	Obtain documentation of manufacturer support for maintenance of the aircraft while the vendor is operating their aircraft in the firefighting role. 

?	Include an evaluation of the airtanker structure (airframe and tank) to FAR 25.571 at Amendment Level 96 or later.  

Amendment 96 of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 25.571 requires that it ?be demonstrated with sufficient full-scale test evidence that WFD will not occur within the design service goal of the airplane.? It requires special consideration for WFD and requires full scale fatigue testing have been completed on a same model airframe.  The corresponding Advisory Circular (AC) 25.571-1C provides general guidelines on the requirements and recommends rigorous posttest teardown inspections as a way to generate sufficient evidence. However, AC 25.571-1C does not specify the teardown protocol, inspection procedures, data collection, and subsequent analyses. Comprehensive guidelines and data that are documented and available to the broader aviation community are lacking. It would require that an LOV (or DSG) be established for the airframe.  


?	Install and monitor an aircraft Operational Load Monitoring (OLM) system for the purpose of updating and improving the continued airworthiness of the Contractor?s aircraft.  

?	Provide for the Contractor to submit revised ICA?s to the FAA for approval based on the operation of the aircraft as an airtanker using the data collected from the OLM system.  The revised ICA would be based on either an analysis similar to that used in FAA certification or a combination of analysis used for FAA certification and data obtained from firefighting operations.  As a minimum, revised ICA?s would be submitted prior to the 3rd year of the contract.  Copies of the package submitted to the FAA will be sent to the Contracting Officer.

?	Explain how a quality assurance program will be put in place to insure that the Contractor can predict and prevent fatigue separations.

Description

Request for Information
Methods of producing highly collimated, temporally variable X-ray beams

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is requesting information on revolutionary ideas and approaches to generate collimated X-ray beams that can be modulated temporally and spectrally to support DoD needs.  The requested information is sought to determine if academia and industry have ideas that warrant specific project-oriented investment by DARPA in this area.  No funding has currently been allocated to this effort.  A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and/or other solicitation may or may not result from the findings of this Request for Information (RFI).

Introduction

Advances in the field of X-ray detectors have led to breakthroughs in ability to detect and time X-ray pulses.  New approaches to X-ray optics and X-ray generation have been developed for applications ranging from X-ray astronomy to high-energy particle physics.  One can see that it may be desirable to design an X-ray transmitter and receiver for communications based on these technological advances.  However, to date any advanced X-ray transmitter and/or X-ray laser is lagging the advanced X-ray detectors.  The goal of any DARPA program in this area would be to develop a highly collimated X-ray beam that would have high wall-plug efficiency and the ability to be modulated on short timescales.

Problem Definition

DARPA is interested in ideas that will lead to the development of high efficiency, medium to high power, time-variable collimated X-ray sources.  New X-ray sources should operate somewhere in the 1 keV - 10 MeV energy range.  The ability to tune energy within this energy range is desirable.  The X-ray source should have high wall-plug efficiency and the ability to be scaled from medium to high power output.  Fast time variability (< 10 ns) would be required.  If the X-ray source can produce coherent X-rays this is an advantage.

DARPA is interested in ideas that leverage off of existing developments in laser accelerators, electron optics for small electron and X-ray point source generation, advances in undulator or inverse-Compton technology, and X-ray optics.  However, DARPA is not interested in making specific advances in only one of these areas unless it is clear that it will be part of a larger system for X-ray generation.

DARPA is not interested in evolutionary improvements to existing commercially available X-ray generators or X-ray optics, nor funding requests or investment opportunities to bring existing work into production.  This RFI seeks potential high-risk high-payoff research opportunities related to the development of a highly collimated temporally variable X-ray source.

Request for Information Focus Areas

The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge into new ways to make a highly collimated X-ray source.  DARPA/STO is soliciting position papers that promise technological advances in the following areas:
1)	Ability to create and/or focus electrons down to extremely small spot sizes
2)	Ability to accelerate electrons to high energies over short distances with high wall-plug efficiency
3)	Ability to efficiently create X-rays from accelerated electrons
4)	Ability to beam and/or focus X-rays
5)	Ability to modulate the X-ray output using modulation in any step of the X-ray generation process.

Workshop

DARPA will hold a workshop for selected RFI respondents in the vicinity of Arlington, VA in October 2007.  The workshop may include an overview of previous DARPA programs, historical assumptions, statement of the current state of the art, today's requirements and challenges, invited presentations, submitter presentations, discussions, and Q&A.  

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS
This announcement contains all information required to submit a position paper.  No additional forms, kits or other materials are required.  

DARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources including but not limited to universities, university affiliated research centers, federally-funded research centers, private or public companies and government research laboratories.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Dell Latitude D820 Laptop.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. As part of the “NIV on a laptop” initiative, CA/CST has identified the Dell Latitude D820 laptop as the laptop that meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested laptop options. The Dell Latitude D820 laptop was selected for the following reasons: •Ability to be configured as a training server, loaded with an Oracle database, and with all CA overseas applications. •Ability to run WinMagic SecureDoc software. •Exceeds the Consular Affairs minimum hardware requirements for laptop workstations. Because CA will be running both the NIV software and the Oracle database on the same computer, processor speed and storage capacity are ciritical factors in the performance of the system.  Dual-core processors allow the Latitude D820 laptop workstation to split tasks between two separate processor cores, splitting the load and get more done in less time. The processors do more work each second, allowing the user to run multiple applications with noticeably quicker results.  The NIV technical team has conducted test with the Dell Latitude D820 and has demonstrated that the NIV system will run successfully. An added feature is a wide variety of available security software solutions and uses a tri-factor authentication process. The Smart Card reader requires both a card and a password for the operating system to start up, and the user can add the optional fingerprint reader for the third level of user security. With the additional security of a standard slot for locks, optional notebook tracking software, and compatibility with leading security software, the Latitude D820 laptop workstation is safe from hackers, thieves, and malicious viruses and worms. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the Dell Latitude D820 laptop because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Dell Latitude D820 laptop has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The workstation has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excert from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and approval. 

The US SOCOM Enterprise Network is entirely Cisco.  Introduction of different brands into the enterprise would require additional testing and training that would far exceed the cost of purchasing the existing brand name of equipment..Under the terms of the current support contract, the Government is responsible for providing EITC contractors with training on any equipment introduced to the network infrastructure outside that which was originally specified.  The cost of training 4 engineers for 4 weeks  would cost the Government in excess of  $90,000.00. This number assumes a cost of $2,500.00 per week, per person for the training class, as well as an associated travel costs in excess of of $1,000.00 per week, per person. Government labor cost for Network Engineers is also estimated at $2,000.00 per person per week..  Without this brand name procurement, there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

General Quality Requirements:  All materials are to be clean, brand new and free of any defects.  All workmanship is to be of first quality.  The Agency shall have the sole right to determine if this and all other requirements have been met.
Origin of Manufacture:  Only vest assembled entirely by United States citizens or persons who have legally immigrated and/or applied for United States citizenship will be considered for purchase.
Design Requirements: Concealable soft body armor intended for primary use as an undergarment worn concealed by a uniform or other type of shirt. This ballistic vest shall consist of two primary components- the ballistic panels enclosed by a protective Ballistic Panel cover and the Ballistic Vest Carrier or "outer-shell".
General Design and User Coverage. The soft body armor must provide maximum practical coverage for male and female officers for everyday wear.  However it must not bind or restrict user mobility or wearability.  The intent is provide full wrap, or overlap protection of the torso-coverage is to the maximum available consistent with wearability needs.  The soft body armor is defined as a vest with "full wrap" side panels that provide "overlap" protection. Suitable relief of not more than 1 inch should be allowed between the bottom edge of the vest and the gun belt when standing so that no binding occurs when the Officer is in the sitting position.  Ample relief must be provided in the armpit region for maximum mobility and a 2" or 3" scoop neck must be provided to maintain concealability and prevent the armor from showing when worn under a shirt with an open collar.
Ballistic Panels: The back and front armor panels should be one piece units made of Kevlar or Twaron/LFT Protexa and foam weave armor. The armor must meet or exceed National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 2005 Interim standards and preferably have MilSpec certification for Threat Level II protection from multiple hits and must have concurrent V-50 Ballistic Limit "benchmark" testing with the NIJ 2005 Interim testing and proof of certification and test reports must be submitted with this bid. Level II  Lbs/ft2(.83) Thinness(.29 inches) V-50 9mm (1540) V-50 .357 (1562)Backface 9mm (23.5) Backface .357 (32.38)	
Ballistic Panel Covers The armor must be contained in a heat sealed high elastic hydrolysis/microbial resistant polyurethane outer membrane such as VisiBALLISTICS(patent pending)that is opaque on one side and clear on the other. The membrane must be aromatic polyether polyurethane film/sheets with high crystallinity that facilitate bonding to substrates with water based adhesives.  Additional properties are functional flame retardant, high moisture vapor transfer rate and functional static dissipation.  This will provide the ballistic armor with added protection from moisture and odor while permitting a "Self Check" visual inspection system.  The ballistic covering (membrane) must be sealed by ultrasonic welding to prevent moisture penetration of the armor fibers.  The sonic seaming must hold fabric together as such tensile strength of seal is greater than the components on their own.  You must not be able to pull seam or weld apart once the materials are sonically sealed or welded. The membrane must have Velcro tabs that can attach to the inside of the inner face of the carrier for stability of the armor panels must be contained. There must be an additional soft trauma plate which also meets or exceeds NIJ standards and having concurrent V-50 "benchmark" testing to fit in the carrier front as described below. Included in bid material, minimum testing must be conducted and written verification sent in of below testing. Specific Gravity: ASTM Test Method (D-792)and Value 1.12,
Durometer (Shore A): ASTM Test Method (D-2240) and Value (86.88),
Ultimate Tensile Strength: ASTM Test Method(D-882) and Value (8,300 psi), Ultimate Elongation: ASTM Test Method (D-882) and Value550%), 50% Modulus (ND/CD Ave): ASTM Test Method (D-882) and Value (950 psi), 100% Modulus (MD/CD Ave: ASTM Test Method (D-882)Value (1,200 psi), 300% Modulus (MD/C Ave): ASTM Test Method (D-882)and Value (2,800 psi), Tear Resistance (MD/CD Ave): ASTM Test Method (D-1004) and Value (450 psi),and Approximate Yield (Sq. ft/lb @ 1 mil: Value (170)
Ballistic Panel labels:  Concurrent with the NIJ-STD-2005 Interim Requirement, each ballistic panel shall have a label that contains the Manufacturer's name, Threat Level, Size, Model, Lot and Serial Numbers, Date of Manufacture, Strike Face, Care instructions, Certification of Compliance and required warnings on vest limitations according to the NIJ-STD-2005 Interim Requirements.
Ballistic Panel Concealed Label:  Each ballistic vest must also contain a concealed label to enable future tracing of the panel by model, serial and lot number, and date of manufacture.
Ballistic Vest Carrier:  two black in color VERTEX multi adjustable carriers will be issued with each vest. Each carrier must have two stealth plate pockets so that the wearer has the option of using either a standard 5x8 inch (13cmx20cm) or an optional 7x10 inch (18cmx25cm) armor plate. Materials used in the construction of the carriers? inner face must be a knit mesh with moisture management, anti-odor, microbial properties on the body side and have Velcro tabs to hold the upper (shoulder) wings of the armor in place and contribute to the stability of the armor in the carrier.  The Face (outer) side of the carrier must be constructed with 75Dx75D Super Mini-Ripstop made of 1005 polyester.  The material must have a DWR finish and weight of 2.7 oz/yd2 with a breaking strength of 160.5#/inch warp and 102.4 inch fill.  Wear abrasion on this fabric must exceed over 20,000 cycles and have a shrinkage warp of 0.8% and 0.4% fill. Carriers should have a four point Velcro strap system with the side straps no narrower than four (4) inches and no wider than four and one half inches (4 1/2) to permit proper and secure fitting.  All carriers must come with attached shirttails; have zippered access slots for the removal and insertion of the armor panels, not Velcro, except for the torso trauma plate pouch which should be Velcro sealed. 
Product Consistency: The manufacturer must warrant that all shipments of each certified model will be identical in design and construction to that which was originally certified.  The manufacturer and NIJ must have retained samples from the original certification for verification and/or inspection.  No substitutions will be allowed without prior approval of both the Agency and the End User Action Officers.
Serialization: All vests must be serialized, 100% inspected and traceable. All procedures and quality data must be available to the Agency for inspection upon request.
Fiber and Fabric Properties: Each lot's critical fiber properties (denier, # of filaments, fiber type, tenacity, and elongation at break) must have been certified by the fiber manufacturer.  Each lot?s critical fabric properties (weave, warp & fill ends/inch, basis weight, thickness, yarn and fabric tensile properties, 9mm and .357 Magnum V-50 ballistic limits) must have been certified by the fabric manufacturer.
Manufacturer Property Checks: The vest manufacturer must also recheck critical fabric properties (fiber/fabric property certifications, weave type, warp and fill ends/inch, basis weight, and 9mm/357 magnum penetration resistances) of each shipment received prior to its use in manufacturing ballistic vests.
Continued Performance: The manufacturer must warrant that the NIJ certified model will continue to perform at its established V-50 Ballistic Limit Levels, as demonstrated by independent laboratory tests, within a normal variation of +/- 3%, throughout the five year service life of the vest.
Plant Inspections:  The manufacturer must allow unannounced plant and data inspections if the Agency wishes to conduct them, at any time during or after the production of the Agency's vests. (Note:  All Agency plant visits and/or ballistic tests will be paid for by the Agency.)

<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp., EFT #1, located at 1475 East Harry Sheppard Blvd. San Bernardino, CA  92408-0138.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp. under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1: only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The associated NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  This is not a Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, nor a set-aside program.  The closing date for this combined synopsis/solicitation is July 26, 2007, 4:00 pm ET. This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17.
The SMC DET 12/PK Contracting Division, Kirtland AFB, NM, competed and awarded contract FA8818-06-D-0020 to provide rocket motor Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) to Northrop Grumman & Mission Systems Corp., located at 1475 East Harry Sheppard Blvd. San Bernardino CA  92408-0138.  The contract provides for technical, engineering and analytical services supporting various DoD rocket motor programs in requirements generation, planning, budgeting, acquisition, system engineering, and mission assurance.  However, the current contracting office will no longer be responsible for the A&AS requirement that supports the MDA's Flexible Target Family (FTF) missile assets for the period of performance from October 1, 2007 through December 31, 2010.  The MDA will assume all responsibilities for the administration and re-awarding of this requirement under a MDA contract.  Therefore, the MDA intends to award a contract to Northrop Grumman & Mission Systems Corp., the incumbent contractor, on a sole source basis for the FTF A&AS requirement.  This contract will contain the same scope, prices, terms and conditions as the current contract.  As a result, this action reflects an administrative reassignment of the work scope from the existing contract to a new MDA contract instrument.  MDA anticipates the award of an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type, cost plus award fee contract for A&AS support in its mission to develop the FTF LV-2 and STARS/C4 Hybrid launch vehicles (SC4H) and C-4 Reuse program for the MDA's Targets and Countermeasures program.  This A&AS support consist of technical program support through planning, studies and analysis, recommendations for problem resolution, oversight, data review and associated system engineering support tasks necessary to support MDA's FTF missions.  This will be a fully loaded fixed hourly labor rates, with a period of performance of three years and three months from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2010.  The contract will contain five (5) line items:  0001 for Labor, 0002 for Material, 0003 for Other Direct Costs, 0004 for Data and Reports, and 0005 for Award Fee.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals because the previous contracting office already competed this requirement.  However, the Government will considered all responses received within 15 days of this notice.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990.  The determination to proceed on a sole source basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this announcement should be sent to the following address within 15 days of this notice: Missile Defense Agency (MDA)/DACT, Attention: Mark Jones, 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington DC 20301-7100.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-A)

The cover shall be suitably painted with an epoxy primer and neutral color topcoat (to withstand the marine environment), or may be powdered coated.  Care must be exercised to prevent excessive buildup of paint or powder coating in through-holes and threaded holes that may hinder assembly of the battery assembly.

2.3 	Bottom Plate Assembly. The bottom plate assembly acts as an insulator for the battery pack and helps contain it inside the buoy.  It shall be constructed of Garolite (a phenolic material available from McMaster-Carr or equivalent supplier), low density polyethylene, or material approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.  Sharp edges at the center hole and the perimeter shall be relieved (chamfered) to prevent chaffing of the battery leads. No coating is required.

INTRODUCTION.  ---The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a requirement to assist Federal, State and local emergency management and response agencies with tactical mobile and fixed DISASTER EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS (DEC) capabilities for command and control, situational awareness and other critical missions during emergencies and incidents.  ---Hurricane Katrina destroyed a significant number of first responder communications systems in coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.  Outdated and incompatible systems are currently in place to enable basic safety, security and immediate emergency response capability in these areas.  First responders lack adequate radio networks to respond to and manage a catastrophic incident particularly during the evacuation, and search and rescue stages of the event.  
---Mississippi"s three coastal counties and counties that border Southeast Louisiana, where interstate and intrastate evacuation operations are concentrated, currently communicate on dissimilar VHF and 800 MHz radio systems.  Mississippi State agencies operate on a low band VHF system.  Additionally, Louisiana officials communicate on 700 MHz and 700/800 MHz systems that are not interoperable with Mississippi State agencies or County systems.  Interoperability deficiencies and shortcomings can be overcome by the installation of an up-to-date, standards-based 700/800 MHz LMR system in southern Mississippi.  Mississippi Public Safety officials have identified a project, the Mississippi Wireless Integrated Network (MSWIN), to deploy a statewide digital trunked land mobile radio system to coordinate delivery of services to citizens of Mississippi and enable immediate interoperability among public safety resources in routine and emergency situations.  This 700 MHz Public Safety System is intended to provide highly reliable, fast access, private (within groups and individuals) communications to a wide variety of users within the State.  The MSWIN is expected to be deployed over the next 5 years. This acquisition bridges the time gap until the MSWIN project is deployed by deploying tower site infrastructure consistent and compatible with the MSWIN at six (6) tower sites in the southern counties of the State.


===II. PURPOSE.  To bridge the MSWIN time gap and provide MSWIN project communications functionality that will mitigate communications interoperability deficiencies and mission degradation, FEMA plans to purchase six (6) sets of 700 MHz LMR tower site equipment that will be installed at six (6) existing tower sites in southern Mississippi.  The tower sites will be networked using circuits, equipment, systems and facilities provided by the State of Mississippi. This will provide emergency responders with interoperable communications throughout the region during an incident including seamless communications between the Louisiana State Police and Mississippi Highway Patrol and the Transportation Departments of both States.  
***This acquisition will facilitate implementation of the 2006 Gulf Coast Emergency Communication Plan, Mississippi Annex, authorized pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act P.L. 93-288, as amended by P.L. 100-707: Title II Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation Assistance, Federal and State Disaster Preparedness Programs, (Sec. 201, and 5185. Emergency Communications, Sec. 418.)  to establish a program of disaster preparedness that utilizes services of all appropriate agencies and includes coordination of Federal, State and local preparedness programs in anticipation of an emergency of major disaster to establish temporary communications systems and to make such communications available to State and local government officials and other persons as appropriate.
***This statement of work (SOW) describes the type of equipment and services required from the supplier to support FEMA efforts to achieve its goals.

===III. SCOPE.  FEMA intends to purchase six (6) sets of 700 MHz, P-25 compliant, Internet Protocol capable Land Mobile Radio (LMR) tower site infrastructure equipment as follows:--Station equipment including repeaters, radios, linear amplifiers, embedded transmitter combiner systems, receiver multi-coupler systems, site trunking controllers, routers and associated software licenses.--Antenna systems including site specific antennas systems based on licensing requirements, transmission lines, transmission line bridges, connectors, surge suppressors, grounding systems, weatherproofing kits, tie down kits, antenna side-arms, and antenna mounting kits.
--Site support systems including racks and mounting equipment, back-up power source, grounding components, etc.---The LMR tower site equipment will be delivered to six (6) tower sites, set up, optimized, and tested.  The specific equipment required at each site will vary somewhat based on the number of repeaters per site, frequency licensing requirements for the respective tower site localities, and pre-existing infrastructure equipment at the designated tower sites.

Statement of Work for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) Statement of Work for the Green Book

1.  	Background:

On November 16, 1988, congress passed into Law the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA) of 1988.  GADPTRA ?Requires the Secretary to publish and update a list of the official and proprietary name of each new animal drug which has been approved and continues to be approved for safety and effectiveness, including patent information as it comes in.?   The law also provided that within 60 days of enactment (January 15, 1989) CVM would make publicly available a list of all currently approved drugs.  The first bound book, FDA Approved Animal Drug Products was published and made available on January 15, 1989; the green cover created the name the Green Book.

In 1991 a database architecture (using MySQL) was created for the ?FDA Approved Animal Drug List.?  In 1994, an additional resource was added, NADA-specific abstracts from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for each approved NADA.  Although the abstracts have never been part of the Green Book, with the approval of FDA/CVM, the Drug Information Laboratory (DIL) at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine combined them with elements of the Green Book and published them on the World Wide Web (WWW) as the ?FDA Approved Animal Drug Products Database.?   In 1997, DIL added an electronic version of the Green Book to the FDA/CVM WWW site available to the public.  The current Green Book contains eight sections that categorize all approved animal drugs:  Trade names and sponsors, active ingredients, patent information, exclusivity periods, products subject to Notice of Hearing, voluntary withdrawals, suitability petitions and monthly updates made during the course of the year.

The FDA/CVM web site usage statistics and printed Green Book subscriptions show that both the animal pharmaceutical industry and the general public are interested in the information that FDA/CVM has been providing.  Between May 31, 2005 and June 1, 2006 the website recorded 1,492,831 hits as the result of 194,867 client sessions.  Approximately 40 percent of these hits were for the Database of Approved Animal Drugs (DAAD) while the remainder was divided among patent, suitability petition and other information pages related specifically to the Green Book.  Fifty subscribers are currently registered to receive one or more copies of the Green Book.  Thirteen of these subscribers are out of the country including four from Canada, and three from Great Britain.  FDA/CVM has a vested interest in maintaining these avenues of communication to its constituents.

2.	Objectives:
To provide funding for an expert to maintain and improve a searchable relational database for the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine of all New Animal Drug Applications (NADAs) and Abbreviated New Animal Drug Applications (ANADAs) in fulfillment of the requirements of GADPTRA.
3.	Scope:
This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the design, maintenance, database development, and upgrading information systems for the FDA/CVM to facilitate communication with the Animal Health Industry and interested private individuals.  This is done in accordance with the requirement to make publicly available a list of Approved Animal Drugs under GADPTRA.  This also extends to the web interface for searching the ?Database of Approved Animal Drugs (DAAD).?
The contractor is not responsible for generating the data that populates the database, printed or electronic queries.  All data used in populating the data fields is received by the contractor from the FDA/CVM.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in collaboration with the trustees for the Chalk Point oil spill has a requirement for spat-on-shell Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica).  Contractor shall provide live, healthy spat-on-shell Eastern Oysters by setting larvae onto native oyster shell only. 

SCOPE OF WORK:

Setting, Rearing, Transportation And Placement Of Hatchery Seed Spat-On-Shell Of American Oyster (Crassostrea Virginica) For Chalk Point Oyster Reef Sanctuary Project, Maryland.

Introduction

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the lead administrative natural resource trustee for natural resource restoration arising out of the April 7, 2000, pipeline rupture at Pepco?s Chalk Point Generating Facility in Aquasco, Maryland.  The spill released about 140,000 gallons of oil into the Patuxent River and associated shoreline areas.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 authorizes designated Natural Resource Trustees (Trustees) to collect damages from the responsible parties in order to restore the injured natural resources.   Along with NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Maryland Department of the Environment, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources are Trustees.

Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decree settling the claims of the United States and state of Maryland for natural resource damages (United States v. Potomac Electric Power Co.), monies were provided to the Trustees to undertake specific restoration projects. One of those projects entailed creation of a five-acre oyster sanctuary known as the Chalk Point Oyster Reef Sanctuary Project. The oyster sanctuary is intended to partially compensate for lost ecological services to fish, shellfish, benthic communities, and birds. An entity within NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Restoration Center (RC), has been designated as the lead implementing trustee for this project on behalf of the Trustees 

The project consists of a site within the Patuxent River with suitable bottom known as Kitt?s Marsh in the general area between Broomes Island and Sheridan Point. The approximately 5-acresite site was planted with about a 4-inch layer of dredged oyster shell and fines in the summer of 2003 to prepare it to receive spat-on-shell hatchery oyster seed.  The site was seeded with 10 million spat-on-shell oyster seed in June of 2004, and monitoring has occurred since.  Monitoring has shown relatively low initial survival of planted oysters, with stabilization over the last year to a density of 58 per meter squared, with little fouling and minimal disease detected.  Mean size of the single year class of oysters was 77mm in October of 2006.  A minimal amount of natural spatset occurred during the summer of 2006.

Based on these current density levels, and the desire to have the sanctuary be made up of multiple year classes of oysters, the Trustees have determined that it is appropriate to proceed with the planned second seeding in year 4 rather than wait until the initially presumed need for re-planting in year 5.  In a slight deviation from the original plan, the Trustees have also determined that it is advantageous to spread the remaining planting total out over a number of years, to further improve the year class diversity on the site, and to bet-hedge against potential future adverse environmental events. 

Statement of Need

Eyed larvae will be purchased or spawned by the contractor and set on shell in an appropriate oyster setting facility.  Following setting and tank grow-out, the spat-on-shell will be transported to the shelled site and planted on the bottom throughout the 5-acre site.  The required deliverable is 2 million spat-on-shell per year for each of 5 consecutive years. See below for base and option periods.

This Scope of Work is limited to that portion of the NRDA Chalk Point Oyster Restoration Project including the setting, rearing, transport and placement of hatchery seed onto the designated sanctuary site.

Terms

Setting and Rearing of Hatchery Seed
	- The oyster setting facility Technical Contact will provide the NOAA RC Technical Contact a weekly progress report on the setting and growth rates of hatchery seed throughout the sequenced setting and growout periods.
	- Epidemiology samples of 30-35 spat will be collected from each setting batch when the spat attain 7-10 mm in size and sent to the DNR Oxford laboratory for disease analysis.  Disease results shall be made available to the NOAA RC Technical Contact within 10 days from the date samples are received at the laboratory, unless otherwise notified.
	- The maximum desired number of spat per shell is 15.  Any individual shells with spat counts higher than 15 shall be counted as no more than 15 towards the total deliverable.
	- The spat shall be tank-reared or cage-deployed for a period of not less than 2 weeks (three weeks optimally) from settlement prior to removal for transport and seeding.  This is intended to minimize handling and desiccation mortalities, and limit early post settlement mortality.
	- Oyster setting facility staff will determine the number of spat produced no more than 10 days prior to being planted using methodology approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact. The NOAA RC Technical Contact shall have the right to be present and to conduct subset counts of spat-on-shell samples prior to transport and planting.

Land Transportation of Hatchery Seed to Planting Vessel
	- Hatchery seed will not be planted until approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact upon their review of the epidemiology results.
	- The oyster setting facility Technical Contact will provide the NOAA RC Technical Coordinator a minimum notice of 48 hours prior to each planting date.
	

Vessel Transportation and Placement of Hatchery Seed
	- The contractor shall provide for vessel transportation and placement of hatchery seed to the designated sanctuary site (Kitt?s Marsh in the Patuxent River north of Broomes Island).  The vessel will be required to have onboard a light colored tarp and water pump in case their use is needed to reduce desiccation of hatchery seed.
	- NOAA RC in conjunction with MDNR will be responsible for adequately marking the designated planting area with buoys.
	- The Contractor will be responsible for supervising the loading and unloading the spat-on-shell onto the planting vessel, and transporting and planting the hatchery seed onto the designated planting area.  Hatchery seed will be planted in a manner approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact to obtain an equal distribution of hatchery seed throughout the designated planting area.
	
Deliverables and Schedule

The contractor shall produce, transport and place 2 million American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) spat on shell, to the Kitt?s Marsh oyster sanctuary site.

The first hatchery seed planting shall occur no earlier than no later than September 30, 2007, unless approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact.  At the discretion of the Government the contractor may be directed to proceed in each subsequent year (2008 through 2011) with planting 2 million American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) spat on shell, to the Kitt?s Marsh oyster sanctuary site between June and September each year.

A report of this project will be submitted to the NOAA RC Technical Contact by October 15, 2007, and each option year thereafter, if exercised.   The information in this report will include, but not limited to, detailed summary of the number and date of larvae received, larvae setting efficiency rates, spat growth rates, epidemiology results, number of spat produced and date planted, and itemization of the costs associated with this project.

<SOLNBR>OSC-RFQ-035-07-002

<CONTACT>Douglas Stickler, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-3654, Fax 202-254-3729, Email dstickler@osc.gov
<DESC>The purpose ofthis amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted in reference to Solicitation No. OSC-RFQ-035-07-002 

Question 1: I have a client who is highly capable of performing the work in the RFQ and is very interested in performing the work for you.  However, we highly doubt that all of this work can be accomplished for the specified $40,000.00 cap. Please inform me if this amount is in error.

Answer: The $40k stands

Question 2: Does the above statement mean that the maximum amount allocated for this task is 40K?

Answer: YES

Question 3: How many FTEs does the Government estimate will be needed to execute this task?

Answer: Each vendor would be responsible for making the determination on their staffing requirements

Question 4: The RFQ web page is well-written, concise and unambiguous. The only part I had trouble with was a mention of a "demo web site". Are we talking about a non-functioning visual "mock" application - one that merely illustrates the UI and navigation aspects of the web app? Please Clarify...

Answer: The ?demo web site? is not a ?mock? application.  This web site will be functional to show the vendor?s progress after each development iteration.  OSC staff member overseeing this project will be able to access and run the application on this web site anytime.

Question 5: How are firms not within driving distance of OSC/Washington DC expected to compete with those within driving distance? At least several trips to OSC offices appear to be required, yet with the arguably small budget ceiling ($40K), both travel costs and adequate software development best practices cannot simultaneously be followed. Local firms clearly have an (unfair) advantage in competing against other small businesses not in the vicinity of Washington DC. That said, what options are available to distant firms if we perceive the criteria for selection has been unfairly biased in favor of local firms? We wish to compete - and CAN be very competitive - but only if we're operating on a level playing field. Please help me understand how this can be accomplished. 


Answer: The Government plans to make an award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the requirements herein and represents the greatest or best value to the Government. However, this request in no way obligates OSC to award a contract, nor does it commit OSC to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the quotes. 

Office of Special Counsel anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract not to exceed the ceiling price of $40,000. 

Question 6: What is the timeframe for a contractor selection and project commencement? 

Answer: Offers will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) contractor qualifications and technical capability, (2) past performance, and (3) price. Contractor qualifications/technical capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.

Question 7: Does the government need a quote only for this first phase (Requirement phase)?  Would the 40Kceiling be only for the first phase of the project?

Answer: No.  The requirements analysis activities outlined below in the ?Perform Detailed Requirements Analysis? section are now carried out internally by Ed Snyder and the intern.

The contractor is to take the functional requirements and design documents (Project Definition and Analysis, Requirements Definition and System Design) provided by Ed and the intern and carry out the actual implementation phase of the project (System Development, System Test and Deployment).

Question 8: Would the 40Kceiling be only for the first phase of the project

Answer: 40K for all phase of the project

Question 9: Where is the place of performance for this position?

Answer: 1730 M Street NW, Suite 201, Washington, D.C. 20036

<DESC>RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) No. 070106: FY 2007 FEPA TRAINING (PROVIDE A FULL-SERVICE TRAINING FACILITY).  


QUESTION #1: Is there any possibility that San Antonio, TX or Hampton, VA,would be considered as a location for the EEOC FY 2007 FEPA Training?

EEOC RESPONSE: The five (5) locations under consideration for the EEOC FY 2007 FEPA Training are listed in the combine synopsis solicitation (RFQ # 070106). The EEOC will not consider any other locations at this time.

QUESTION #2: Can you share if this is a first time meeting? If not, where was the most FEPA training held?
 
EEOC RESPONSE: We have conducted numerous FEPA training at various locations within the United States. The last time EEOC held a large centralized training for FEPAs was last October, in Dallas,TX.  EEOC believes that most of the participants will have attended at least one EEOC FEPA Training.    
     
QUESTION #3:  What does FEPA stands for?

EEOC RESPONSE: The acronym "FEPA" means Fair Employment Practices Agencies, as stated in the Combine-Synopsis Solicitation RFQ07106, posted at the Fedbizzopps website: www.fedbizopps.gov, on June 27, 2007.    

QUESTION #4: Do you plan on visiting New Orleans prior to your decision?  If so, we can facilitate your visit in setting up your entire schedule-reservations for your stay, airport transfers, and scheduling your appointments.  
 
EEOC RESPONSE:  A site visit is contingent upon the whether the Government exercises its right to conduct an on-site visit and will be limited to those quoters who submit a quotation that is determined to be technically acceptable, i.e.;  meets all the qualifications of the solicitation (RFQ # 070106)  

QUESTION #5:  The following  two questions were submitted  regarding the CLIN line items(See QUESTION #5(a)and #5(b) below):

QUESTION #5(a).  CLIN 0001 and 0004 request QTY: 1 lot - Does that mean the total amount for both weeks together?

EEOC RESPONSE:   Yes. The Quantity of 1 lot is for both weeks.

QUESTION #5(b).  CLIN 0003 requests Supplies for 8 days, but what about CLIN 0003 that requests 660 Food and Beverage Services? 660 would be corresponding to one week / 2 training classes. Should it be 660 x 2?

EEOC RESPONSE:  No.  The quantity 660 is the total for both weeks.  

QUESTION #6:   Can the quotation be hand delivered to your office?

EEOC RESPONSE:  Yes.  

QUESTION #7:   Is Site Solutions Worldwide acting as a 3rd party booking agent for the EEOC for this program "EEOC FY 2007 FEPA Training"?  If so, should we have the hotels respond to them?  If not, we will continue to work with you and I will ask Shelley to follow up upon her return.

<CONTACT>Christina Johnson, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 295-3069, Fax (301) 295-1716, Email cjohnson@usuhs.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions:

1.  "USU will provide the Death Call phone number and the contractor will maintain that number." Questions:

QUESTION:  (a)   What/whose phone number will USU donor families be advised to call? 
	
ANSWER:  USU will be called with notification of death, as published in the USU Anatomical Gift Program (AGP) items 	(i.e., wallet card, donation forms).  The number is located at USU.

QUESTION:  (b)  How is that line to be answered at night?

ANSWER:  After duty hours, the AGP phone number is transferred to USU Security for notification purposes.  Once a death call is received, USU Security will then notify the Contract Funeral Service of the death.  The Contract Funeral Service must notify the USU AGP of the death call the next duty day.  	 

QUESTION:  (c)   Who will be responsible for the paying phone bill for that number? 

ANSWER:  The number is located at USU.  USU will be responsible for paying the phone bill. 

QUESTION:  (d)  Who will be responsible for paying an answering service to answer that number at night?

ANSWER.  The number is located at USU.  USU will be responsible for answering the phone.


2.  Performance and Delivery, Paragraph (b):  "...  refrigeration for an additional period not to exceed 72 hours."

QUESTION:   What if USU is closed for more than 72 hours (e.g. on holiday weekends)?

ANSWER:  Normally a body should be held no more than 72 hours in refrigeration prior to transfer to USU.  At times, there will be extenuating circumstances in which the remains must be held for a longer period.  Prior to delivering any remains held more than 72 hours the Contract Funeral Service must receive written authorization from the Contracting Officer?s Representative.  


3.  Permits, Paragraph 1:  "... contractor will furnish all necessary permits at no additional cost to USU." 

QUESTION:  Doesn't this wording contradict the listed "Service 0001AQ:  Procurement of D.C. Medical Examiner's approval for anatomical donation and/or cremation"? Additional stops/trips are required to obtain ME permits in D.C. and Virginia as well as transit permits in Virginia. The contractor should be permitted to charge for any such additional trip/stop, as required by the circumstances.

ANSWER:  Clin 0001AQ description is amended to read as:

Procurement of D.C. Medical Examiner?s fee for anatomical donation and/or cremation

A Clin will be added for any additional trip/stops.


4.  Other Services/Fees:  0001AK: Transfer . over 51 miles radius .: Questions:

QUESTION:  (a)   What is the maximum distance the contractor will be expected to travel for a transfer?

ANSWER:  The maximum distance is 150 miles.  The contractor can only bill up to 4,000 miles for the year.


QUESTION:  (b)  Above a distance of 50 miles, it may necessary to engage a local funeral home to pick up a body (e.g. from a residence or a nursing home) and refrigerate the body until the contractor can get there to pick it up. May our bid specify that in such cases we will add the other funeral home's charges to ours?

ANSWER:  If necessary, the contractor is authorized to engage a local funeral service to provide the professional services as required.  If so, the contractor is responsible for the performance of the local funeral service.

 
5.  QUESTION:  0001AR: For clarity, can you add the words "Procurement of" at the beginning? 

Clin 0001AR description is amended to read as:

Procurement of VA Medical Examiner?s fee for donation and/or cremation   
 

6.  QUESTION:  0001AT: Death Certificates:  The family has always paid for the filing of the death certificates and certified copies of the death certificate.  Is USU now going to pay for the filing and certified copies for the family?

 ANSWER:  CLIN 0001AT will be deleted.


7.  QUESTION:  0001AV: After Hour Death Call, including obtainment of vital statistics: Can you amend the solicitation to omit the reference to obtaining vital statistics here? Vital statistics are normally obtained either before or after the death call, and rarely during a distraught late-night call.  Ideally, USU should obtain most vitals when the donation is pre-arranged.  When the contractor is engaged to obtain vitals, it should be able to assess an additional fee for that work. So can you list "Obtaining Vital Statistics" as a separate fee?

 ANSWER:  CLIN 0001AV is amended to read as:

After hour Death Calls  12 ea

Clin 0001AW is added to read as:

Obtaining Vital Statistics	6 ea


8.  QUESTION:  Can the solicitation be amended to list fees for the following:

--"Securing a signed death certificate," both within and outside a 50-mile radius,

ANSWER:  Securing death certificates in covered in Permits of the SOW.  

--"Other extra trip/stop, as required," both within and outside a 50-mile radius?

ANSWER: A Clin will be added for any additional trip/stops. 


9.  Clin 0001AS is deleted.


10.  Clin 0001AX is added to read as:


Miscellaneous Expenses

(i.e. additional trips to obtain permits, certificates, licenses)
