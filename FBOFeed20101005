<DESC>PurposeThis RFI supports market research by The Human Resources Systems Division of the Electronic Systems Center, to obtain industry input on the existing capability in implementing a solution utilizing a IBM FileNet P8 solution.  The information will also assist in locating small business sources as well as obtaining industry feedback on the eForms draft Request for Proposal information.  The goal is to clarify uncertainties and identify disconnects in the draft RFP to familiarize industry with the eForms requirement and facilitate quicker responses for the formal RFP.
SummaryThe Enterprise Electronic Forms (eForms) effort is anticipated as a Small Business set-aside acquisition.  However, small businesses will also be permitted to team with other partners as they see fit to provide a competitive bid for the project.  eForms seeks to provide automation of personnel-related forms to minimize manually intensive processes, such as printing, hand filling and scanning Air Force forms for records storage. Solution will address "cradle-to-grave" handling of forms through Airman initiation of form, pre-population of required data fields, automated routing for appropriate approval, metrics reporting, and storage in the associated data repositories.  The data from the eForms system will be available to all members of the Air Force, constrained by their specific roles via a built-in Role Based Access (RBA).  Airmen and their supervisors will be able to query the status of their forms and see where they are in the process. Total Force Service Center (TFSC) h! elp desk agents will also be able to see forms data in order to provide service to those Air Force customers needing help with their forms.  The eForms solution will rely on the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) data service and Automated Records Management System (ARMS) to perform as envisioned.  The appropriate documentation will be provided to the eForms vendor in the RFP to describe which data elements are needed and how to interface with the SOA service.  For ARMS, the Interface Control Document (ICD)-in the Non-Functional Requirements-will  be provided to show how the vendor is to configure eForms to permit a proper interface.  Since there is a need to share eForms infrastructure with other applications across the AF enterprise, the interfaces will be standard and open to allow for accessibility and interoperability.The Air Force currently owns over 700,000 licenses for IBM FileNet P8 and seeks to utilize this product as the platform to implement eForms.
NOTE:  This is not a solicitation for proposals nor is it a request to perform work.  The Government will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this notice.   Responses will be used to identify potential sources, potential business arrangements, market conditions, and an assessment of solutions and products and their potential to satisfy the subject requirement. The Government intends to release a Request for Proposal within six (6) weeks of publication of this RFI with more specific details on the eForms requirements. 
Information Requested
1.  Please review the attached items that are part of the draft Request for Proposal package.  Please note areas of confusion or uncertainty and feel free to ask questions that might help to clarify the package.  Answers will be provided to all vendors and posted on HERBB and FedBizOpps.2.  The workflow and business process documentation for the first five (5) forms will be provided in the RFP.  These five forms will be representative of the difficulty of the remaining forms.  Copies of the remaining forms will be provided to you, but they will not have the associated business process documentation.  The Government is proposing an approach to have industry bid a firm priced ordering table-which breaks down the primary cost drivers in developing an automated form.  A notional sample of the table is included in the attachments.  With these drivers identified, the Government feels that industry should be able to assign costs to those drivers against which the remaining forms can be ordered-once the workflows and business process documentation is provided.  The defined work in first five forms should serve as the basis in creating the table, as the nature of the work for the remaining forms is similar.    a. Please provide your assessment of the concept of providing a firm priced ordering table     b. Please review the cost drivers identified and note, in your opinion, any missing drivers or if the ones listed are incorrect.    c. Please note if the documentation provided for the first 5 forms will be sufficient for you to identify proper cost drivers and permit you to fill out the pricing table for remaining forms.  3. The timeline for availability of the SOA data services is not currently known.  The project responsible for exposing this information anticipates an award around the same time as eForms.  The data services will be used to pre-populate forms and facilitate some aspects of automated workflow.  The Government has indicated a preference to not delay the entire eForms project until those services are available.  The Government would like to request a contract option available to execute when the data services are available.  The SOA Guidebook-in the Non-Functional Requirements-will be provided in the RFP and will indicate how the selected eForms vendor will access the exposed SOA data.  Also the fields requiring pre-population in the first five forms will be provided.  The information for the remaining forms will be provided when it is available.   a.  Please indicate your ability to provide a firm priced option to implement connection to the SOA data services.     b.  With the timeline uncertainty, can you provide options to be started within 4 months,  8 months, and 12 months of contract award?4. eForms will require a Role Based Access mechanism for users accessing the system.  Please indicate your experience configuring the FileNet P8 RBA capability.5.  Please indicate if you have experience implementing solutions at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).6. Our office previously released an RFI on 25 Aug 10.  Overall response was not as high as anticipated.  Some businesses indicated they did not respond because they assumed large businesses would compete for the award.  As previously stated, eForms is anticipated as a small business set-aside opportunity.  The questions from the previous RFI are listed below.  Those companies who already responded do not need to re-answer the questions below.	1.  Please identify your experience in the following areas   a. IBM FileNet P8 implementations to include design/development and automation of forms/business process workflow    b. Implementing FileNet P8 with either US Government, Department of Defense, or Air Force organizations on a Government owned/operated network infrastructure   c.  Implementing large-scale enterprise solutions using FileNet P8 (Large being either over 500,000 users, over 100 forms/business processes, and over 15,000 concurrent users)
        2.  Please provide list of projects relevant to the experience listed above, with associated customer points of contact.  Please identify if you were the prime vendor or a partner in the projects listed.  Also include the extent of your work on these projects such as involvement in design, interfacing, installation, and configuration.   
        3.  In the relevant projects listed above, please identify major risks to cost, schedule, and performance that were encountered, which phase of the project they were encountered, and how they were mitigated.  Based on the information provided by eForms, what would you see as potential risk areas to the eForms project?
        4.  Please identify your current Software Development CMMI appraised level (if applicable).
        5.  Please identify if you are a large or small business.  If a small business, please specify which category (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, etc.).
        6.  If a large business, what capabilities have been or are good candidates for small business subcontracting?  Please provide supporting rationale.
        7.  At least five (5) processes/forms-of varying complexity-will be provided in the RFP.  However, the majority of eForms business processes will not be fully identified at RFP release.  These forms will be identified by name and a copy will be provided, however, the mapping of the business process will be done by the government and provided prior to your implementation.  a. Are you able to provide a firm fixed price for automating the remaining processes that are to be documented?  b. What do you view as the cost drivers in pricing the work with the complete documentation?  Is it all based on form/workflow complexity?c. What information would be sufficient for you to confidently price the forms/workflows that do not yet have the business process fully documented?d. What approach is typically done/used to provide fixed pricing with work not fully defined at time of proposal (i.e. categorize Hard/Med/Easy, etc.)?
        8.  Will you be able to provide training that is sufficient for the government to assume sustainment of the application-to include introducing new forms and workflow, as well as changes to existing ones?  Have you done this type of transition in your previous efforts?
        9.  Discuss your involvement in any on-going related Government or DoD efforts and how the Air Force could potentially leverage these efforts to reduce total program costs.

Services to include, but are not limited to conceptual design, preliminary designs, working drawings and specifications, cost estimating, site visits, miscellaneous reports, and construction period services.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION: The Governments selection of the best value contractor is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s). Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the contract in view of the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services) evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team. Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team. The key positions should include: Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors. Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES. FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s). FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years) evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules. FACTOR 4 Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time) evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods. FACTOR 5 Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to Fort McCoy, WI and knowledge of the identified locality) evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from the LOCATION and the extent of the Firms knowledge of the LOCATION and knowledge/experience concerning state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract. FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months) in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement. FACTORS 1 ,2& 5 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 3& 4  which are each weighted EQUAL. FACTORS 1, 2 & 5 are also SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 6  will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal. Relative to FACTOR 5 Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a firms project team(s) is not co-located in the same office.<BR><BR>SUBMISSION FORMAT: Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission. Submitting firms are to include the DUNS number along with the name of the firm in Block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, Section B. A firm located within the United States may obtain a DUNS number by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com/us/. If a submitting Firm is located outside the United States, the local Dun and Bradstreet office should be contacted. Relative to all submittals, FONT SIZE shall be at least 10 point or larger (MS Word Font Size 10 for Times New Roman, Arial and Courier New fonts are examples of the minimum acceptable Font Size). Except as otherwise indicated, pages shall be 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches. Where page limits are indicated for Parts/Sections of the SF 330, excess pages will not be read or considered. Each side of a sheet of paper shall be counted as a single page. Blank sheets or tabs separating the sections within the SF 330 will not count toward any page limitation. The Organizational Chart required in Section D and the Matrix required as Section G, may be presented on sheets up to 11 inches by 17 inches. If an 11 inch by 17 inch sheet is used it shall be neatly folded to 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches and bound in the SF 330 at the proper location. All key personnel for whom resumes are provided shall be shown on the organizational chart in Section D. Resumes in Section E shall not exceed two (2) pages each. Multiple Resumes may be reflected on a single page. Resumes shall be provided for the qualified professional personnel indicated in FACTOR 1, above. Professional licenses, registrations, and/or certifications shall be specifically identified on resumes and the failure to indentify a license, registration and/or certification will result in a presumption that none exists for the individual for whom the Resume is offered. A maximum of Ten (10) projects including the prime and consultants will be reviewed in Section F. No more than one (1) page should be used for each project. Multiple projects may be reflected on a single page. When listing projects in Section F, an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) with multiple Task Orders as examples is not considered a project. Multiple task orders that are associated with a single project may be used and will be considered a single project; however, listing a single contract with task orders that may be unrelated is not considered a single project. A task order executed under an IDC contract is a project. In Block G-26, along with the name, include the firm with which the person is associated. Section H shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages. Indication of favorable performance ratings, awards, and repeat clientele in Section H is recommended. A SF 330 PART II is required for each branch office of the Prime Firm and any Subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract. <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Acquisitions intends to negotiate a 7 year contract with Information Management Services Inc. (IMS), to provide biomedical data management, analytical support, systems and web development and maintenance to approximately 150 researchers in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG/NCI), who publish an average of over 400 publications each year. IMS coordinates and supports the tasks for an average of over 100 concurrent, diverse, domestic and international DCEG's studies each month. This support is crucial to DCEG's mission to discover the molecular and environmental etiologic determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. This support enables DCEG to uniquely conduct epidemiologic and genetics research projects that are:
<p>&bull; high risk, <br />&bull; need long-term commitments of funding and scientific staff, <br />&bull; require a national programmatic approach, <br />&bull; call for a quick response to emerging public health or scientific issues, <br />&bull; might go unattended by groups without a national and international reach, or<br />&bull; require an interdisciplinary strategy fostered by the breadth of expertise and resources in the intramural research programs of NCI and NIH.</p>
<p>The project requires a contractor to manage and coordinate staff in support of varied and simultaneous biomedical related projects of variable population size (hundred to several hundred thousand individuals) and complexity (molecular data including high-throughput genomics data, environmental exposure data, complex study designs, and multiple data sources etc). Specifically, the project will provide computing support for its biostatisticians, epidemiologists, geneticists and other DCEG professionals. This computer-related support falls into four main categories:</p>
<p>(1) Biomedical data management activities includes appropriate manual and automated secure processes to enter, store, and retrieve study data and documentation for environmental and molecular epidemiology and genetics studies<br />(2) Statistical programming, analysis, reporting, and infrastructure services includes providing support for programming to streamline analyses, performing environmental and molecular epidemiology and genetics study data analyses as directed by DCEG investigators, developing new statistical methods and study-design development, and for report and manuscript preparation<br />(3) Systems design, development, and maintenance support is required for study data management, statistical analysis and science administration processes such as budget tracking <br />(4) Web design, development and maintenance support includes the design, development, and maintenance of study websites.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).</p>
<p>IMS is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The contractor is uniquely qualified by virtue of its continued performance over this period of time and is the only source that can provide the services for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) IMS has the required number of specialized interdisciplinary personnel that is sufficiently cross-trained in biomedical data management, statistical analysis and programming, systems and web development, and maintenance ensuring seamless support for all of the tasks for all of the studies (over 150) in a coordinated manner. With a new contractor, new staff would need to be hired and trained with unavoidable learning curve inefficiencies as well as training costs.</p>
<p>2) IMS has extensive experience in concurrently supporting multiple epidemiologic research projects of variable population size and complexity, several of which involve non-NIH and international institutions.</p>
<p>3)IMS has been heavily involved in the preplanning of several ongoing studies and is crucial to the performance of the tasks. The time required to gain this experience by a new contractor would lead to extensive time delays and lost opportunities.</p>
<p>4)IMS has expert experience in:</p>
<p>i. Creating analytic datasets pooled from several studies and harmonized to ensure comparability to support consortia efforts focused on integrative analyses to study gene-environment interactions.</p>
<p>ii. Maintaining data systems to support DCEG study data storage and analysis as well as for science administration.</p>
<p>iii. Performing DCEG investigator-requested analyses using diverse classical and molecular epidemiological data analysis algorithms and modules implemented in multiple languages i.e., SAS, R, MatLab, S-Plus, Stata, SPSS, C++, and FORTRAN.</p>
<p>iv. Building innovative and computationally efficient user-friendly software to package multiple analysis modules to enable stream-lined multi-step analyses or to facilitate development and use of new statistical methods for diverse classical and molecular epidemiological data.</p>
<p>v. Selection of controls within cohorts with banked biospecimens for the development of nested case-control and case-cohort studies of biomarkers.</p>
<p>5) IMS is highly experienced in working with other contracts that support DCEG studies in the actual conduct of its field studies nationally and internationally. For example, IMS has been working closely with DCEG's laboratory contractor to facilitate providing data from the recent genomics high-throughput technologies increasingly being used by DCEG for gene environment interaction analyses. Similarly, IMS has extensive experience working with biospecimen collection and storage contractors to track, store, and report biospecimen data, increasingly being used to study gene-environment interactions. Communication protocols between these entities would need to be redeveloped thus delaying the science and substantially costly.</p>
<p><br />6) IMS has developed quality control and assurance and documentation procedures to ensure accurate use and reuse of data and resources. Transition to another contractor would necessitate redevelopment of standard operating procedures which would be costly and cause delays to the Government.</p>
<p>7) IMS has been innovatively adopting and implementing software and data standardization efforts being implemented within the NCI where appropriate. They have adapted and reused software within the different NIH organizations which substantially reduces costs to the Government.</p>
<p>8) IMS performs similar data management and analysis intensive tasks for two other NCI Divisions, namely the Division of Cancer Prevention and the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences. This enables sharing of infrastructure (equipment and building) and staff resources to optimize their use across these Divisions and thus reduce costs to the Government as well as lead start-up time.</p>
<p>The support by IMS is critical for DCEG to continue its analyses of ongoing as well as completed studies and for any new studies that would need to be analyzed during this time-frame. Timely follow up of published methods/findings is essential to lead the field especially in the field of genomics which is a highly competitive field. IMS assists during all of the phases of the publishing process including providing the requested datasets for analyses, performing the requested analyses and help with manuscript preparation.</p>
<p>However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they may respond by submitting a capability statement (5 page limit) within 15 days of publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statements received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Lisa Coleman, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Suite 600, Room 6064 MSC 7192 Bethesda, Maryland 20852. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. Respondents may submit their capability statements via email in addition to 2 hard copies.</p>

The period of performance will not be advertised herein due to security operational requirements of the United States Civilian and/or Military Expeditionary Forces.  The estimated date for issuance of the solicitation is on or about 8 October 2010.  The response date specified in this synopsis as 12 October 2010 is the estimated date when proposals will be due. A copy of the solicitation will be provided to those approved/authorized Expeditionary Service Contractors as determined by the Contracting Officers.  Interested Offerors, with the exception of those offerors that have approved Husbanding Agent contracts with FISC Norfolk, must submit a written request to the Contracting Officer by 7 October 2010, along with proof (i.e.
 licenses in the country or by the US Embassy) of being able to operate in the locations of Suriname and Guyana.  One award will be made for both locations.

The approved list of materials, support and authorized approved sources for bottled water requirements will be specified in the solicitation. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this contract is to obtain Expeditionary Logistics and Life Support Services for U.S. Navy forces, and other designated personnel, operating ashore in GUYANA (GUY) and SURINAME (SUR).SCOPE:  The Expeditionary Services Contractor (ESC) shall provide logistics and life support to expeditionary Naval forces operating in GUY and SUR.
 This ashore presence is part of a larger U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) directed mission: Continuing Promise 2010 (CP10). Approximately 300 medical, logistics, engineering and security personnel will be moved daily from USS IWO JIMA (LHD7) via U.S. Navy and contracted sea and air assets to the ports of New Amsterdam, GUY and Paramaribo, SUR. Additional helicopter landing zones are scattered around the operating areas and have been previously coordinated with Host Nation forces. From those locations personnel will be distributed via contractor provided transportation to local medical and engineering work sites. Each of these operating locations will require some level of logistics life support for day time medical and engineering efforts.
 Most personnel will depart daily to the ship for overnight lodging. However, small numbers of forces may remain overnight in the field or in commercial lodging for security and set up/break down of patient screening facilities. Host Nation military/police will provide all necessary force protection and site security services as previously arranged by the Military Group in GUY and SUR.

Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>KC-135 Longwire Antenna
<SOLNBR>FA8105-11-Longwire
<RESPDATE>110810
<CONTACT>Mark A. Davidson, Phone 405-739-2572, Email mark.davidson@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />The C/KC-135 Sustainment Division, OC-ALC GKC, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research requesting information on Probe and Long Wire High Frequency (HF) Antenna Replacement Modification for KC-135 R/T model aircraft.
<p>PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry for possible options to either maintain current KC-135 HF antennas or replace them with new configurations. The root problem with current antennas is the Lightning Arrestors associated with each antenna are no longer being manufactured or repaired.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The original KC-135 aircraft were installed with two different configurations of HF antennas, each having a different Lightning Arrestor. The HF Probe Antenna installed on the top of the vertical stabilizer uses Part Number 1931-03 (NSN 5920-00-677-9869) lightning arrestor. This lightning arrestor is the same for all KC-135 HF Probe Antennas. The HF Long Wire Antennas are installed in the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer and run to the forward right side of the aircraft have two different configurations of lightning arrestors installed. These are part numbers 1916-01 (5920-00-686-0084) for the Boeing installed Long Wire Antenna and Part Number 1912-02-A (NSN 5841-01-279-4286) for the Rockwell Collins (RC) installed Long Wire Antenna. Each KC-135 aircraft has, or will soon have, two HF antennas installed, one Probe and one Long Wire Antenna. None of the three different configurations of lightning arrestors are currently being manufactured or repaired.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: <br />The requirements listed below are viewed to be an integral part of any technical solution proposed in response to this RFI. All improvements, deviations, and modifications of these requirements should maintain the intent of the original requirement.<br />1. The government is willing to consider and implement several potential solutions to lightning arrestor issues. The potential solution options are:</p>
<p>a) Identify a new HF antenna that doesn't require a long wire or lightning arrestor.<br />b) Identify a source for manufacture and/or repair of the current lightning arrestors.<br />c) Identify new lightning arrestors as a replacement for the HF Probe Antenna and RC and Boeing Long Wire Antennas ... may or may not require new antennas or couplers.</p>
<p>2. Interested parties may propose solutions to any and/or all of the options identified in item 1 above.</p>
<p><br />3. Interested parties to option 1a should describe the technical capabilities of the potential solution sufficient to demonstrate equivalent or superior performance to the current design. Provide a brief high-level technical description of the antenna and explain system compatibility. Describe any limitations such as willingness to provide data rights, etc. Costs should be identified for small order quantities (50 - 100) and a large order quantity (300 - 400). If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged. Briefly address all potential risks.</p>
<p>4. Interested parties to option 1b should provide a description of their ability to manufacture and/or repair the current design lightning arrestors. Estimated costs of newly manufactured current design lightning arrestors should be provided for small quantity buys (10 - 15) and larger buys (25 - 50). Bidders should identify their repair rate and approximate costs for repair of the arrestors given both a low repair rate (1-2 month) and a higher rate repair. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged. Briefly address all potential risks.</p>
<p>5. Interested parties to option 1c should describe the technical capabilities of any potential solution sufficient to demonstrate equivalent or superior performance to the current design. Provide a brief high-level technical description of the lightning arrestor, antenna if applicable, and system. Explain system compatibility. Describe any limitations such as willingness to provide data rights, etc. Lightning arrestor and antenna design should consider ease to install and maintain. The technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged. Costs should be identified for small (10 - 15) and large (25 - 50) order quantities. Briefly address all potential risks.</p>
<p>6. For all options, some testing may be required IAW MIL-STD-810 or RTCA/DO-160. Specific areas of concern include explosive atmosphere, vibration, temperature and shock.</p>
<p>7. For option 1c the arrestor design should consider ease to install and maintain, and the system will require no modification of main aircraft structure. Ancillary structure may be used for hardware attachment. For option 1c the antenna design should also consider ease to install and require minimum modification to aircraft structure.</p>
<p>OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: <br />The KC-135 operating temperatures range from below freezing to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. System must be explosion-proof, resistant to vibration, and approved for in-flight use. FAA certification of the proposed solution is a plus, but not required.</p>
<p>INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: <br />Primary power source should be aircraft power. The KC-135 has 115/200 volts AC, 400-hertz, three-phase electrical power, single-phase 28VAC, and 28VDC.</p>
<p>COMPATIBILITY <br />Explain system compatibility. Describe any limitations.<br /><br />ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING<br />State the type of environmental and flight testing that has been performed on the system.<br /><br />COST<br />Provide the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system and/or repair effort, including low volume production numbers, high volume production numbers and cost of the data/drawing rights.</p>
<p>AVAILABILITY <br />Provide system availability information. Give information detailing if the equipment is available off-the-shelf immediately. If equipment is not available provide lead time for component acquisition.<br /><br />PAST PERFORMANCE<br />Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this RFI addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work).</p>
<p>RESPONSE<br />Services to include research and development, technology insertions, system integrations, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support, logistic support services, and engineering support. Interested parties may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrade and operational support costs.</p>
<p>The information you provide may be used by the USAF to consider planning, program phasing and tailored technical requirements. Your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any manner. Although the identification of contributing parties will not be divulged outside the Government, the Government reserves the right to use in whole or part any industry information that is received as a result of this RFI. Your participation in the RFI will not affect your company's position during any solicitation, nor will this RFI be used as criteria for the prequalification of respondents for future solicitations. Modification installation effort will be performed by Government personnel.</p>
<p>Through this RFI the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature or emerging technologies which meet the requirements. It is emphasized that the Government will not pay for contractor efforts to respond to this Request for Information. This RFI is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. Nor is the Government obligated in any other way by this request. Information obtained from this document is for planning purposes only. Participants are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.</p>

<DESC><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SYNOPSIS:</span></strong><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes issued by the C/KC-135 Contracting Branch, OC-ALC/GKCK at Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB). The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking information from domestic manufacturers regarding cost schedule and performance parameters required to produce a ruddevator retention sleeve in accordance with Government drawings that have been provided. <br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />PURPOSE:</span></strong> <br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information from domestic manufacturers capable of fabricating and assembling a ruddevator retention sleeve in accordance with the provided Government drawings.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY:<br /></span></strong>This RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a proposal, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>The Government requests that non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI. However, should proprietary information be submitted, it should be marked "PROPRIETARY", and will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND / ISSUES:</span></strong><br />The Air Force has detected several instances of boom ruddevator bearing retention failure in its KC-135 aircraft. Several incidences of these failures have been reported, with one such incident resulting in the loss of a ruddevator in flight. It has also been discovered that mechanical swaging of these bearings as specified on the original manufactured drawings is not possible at the depot or in the field without removing support fitting from the boom. Additionally, many of the ruddevator fittings have widespread gouges and indentations on the bearing lugs which have been caused by removal of the ruddevator bearing in the inspection of the lugs and replacement of the bearings. As a solution to these identifiable issues, the Government has designed a sleeve to be installed in the ruddevator as a means of retaining the bearings. Government-developed drawings for the sleeve are attached and are made a part of this RFI.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OVERVIEW OF OBJECTIVES:</span></strong><br />The Government intends to procure up to 1,250 ruddevator retention sleeves. The contractor would be required to fabricate and assemble the sleeve in accordance with the Government-developed drawings. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contracting Office Address:<br /></strong></span>OC-ALC/GKCK<br />3001 Staff Dr. STE 2AE1 86A<br />Tinker AFB OK 73145-3020</p>

<DESC>NASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD) currently sponsors a number of flightmissions, divided between missions in development and missions in operations. One ofSMDs programmatic objectives is to maximize the science return for the Nation within theavailable budget. This Request for Information (RFI) solicits input from the broad spacescience community that would contribute to NASAs study of possible new uses for the NASADeep Impact/EPOXI spacecraft beyond its current mission. Responses to this RFI will beused to inform NASAs program planning.Background:NASA has science missions under development and in operation that send spacecraftthroughout the Solar System, including low and high Earth orbits, station keeping nearSun-Earth Lagrangian points, orbits around every planet from Mercury to Saturn as well asthe Moon and asteroids, drift away Solar orbits, and trajectories out of the Solar Systemand into interstellar space. Each of these missions has science objectives that will berealized through a prime mission and possible mission extensions when the prime missionhas been completed. NASAs science missions are managed by the Science MissionDirectorate (SMD); information on these missions may be found athttp://science.hq.nasa.gov/missions/	      . It is a programmatic objective of SMD to get more science return from the availablebudget. One way of increasing the science return from NASAs science missions is tocontinue operating the spacecraft after the prime mission has been completed. NASA has abiennial review process, called the Senior Review, to consider and approve the operationof spacecraft and extend the prime science mission.An alternative to extending the prime science mission is to initiate a new scienceinvestigation with an existing spacecraft after the prime science mission has beencompleted. There have been several examples of this in the past, including the 1982approval to use the ISEE-3 spacecraft (renamed ICE) for an encounter with CometGiacobini-Zinner, the 2007 approval to use the Stardust spacecraft for the NewExploration of Temple 1 (NExT) investigation as a follow-on to Deep Impact, and the 2007approval to use the Deep Impact spacecraft (renamed EPOXI) for a study of extrasolarplanets during its cruise to encounter Comet Hartley 2. These new science investigationsrealize unique, high impact investigations that otherwise would cost substantially moreto execute, and they provide high science value for the funds expended.In February 2011, the Deep Impact (EPOXI) spacecraft will complete the Phase E primaryoperations phase of its mission.  Details of the spacecraft design and performancecapabilities may be found on the Discovery Programs Science Support Office (SSO) ProgramAcquisition Website at http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/deep_impact_package.html		.Links 1  6 on that webpage describe the instruments and remain valid.	Links 7 and 8,which describe orbital parameters and fuel budget, are superseded as follows:The orbit of the Deep Impact spacecraft following the Hartley 2 encounter on November 4,2010, has the following characteristics. The elements are in a heliocentric, Earth MeanOrbital reference frame.  Deep Impact Spacecraft Orbital Parameters	Reference Epoch = December 1, 2010 00:00:00 ET 	Semimajor axis = 164114602.828260630 km 	Eccentricity = 0.111215495 	Inclination = 3.201462042 deg 	Longitude of Ascending node = 95.119656916 deg 	Argument of periapse = 126.186162151 deg 	Time of periapse passage = -9126823.136892710 sec 	Mean anomaly = 90.610709095 deg 	True anomaly = 103.232671772 deg These values are based on the Design Reference Mission (DRM) 230 reference trajectory.Note that there are several maneuvers that will be implemented subsequent to when DRM230was created, and the size of these maneuvers will not be known until the comet ephemerisis improved through the use of approach data. Thus the above values are subject tochange, but the overall characteristics of the orbit are representative and can be usedfor most purposes not requiring extremely high accuracy.Deep Impact Spacecraft Fuel Budget (as of 7/27/10)Event = Fuel UsedFuel use through 7/27/10 (TCM-19) = 78.48 kgFuel use 7/27/10 through Encounter {1}= 1.22 kgUnusable Fuel = 1.15 kgRemaining Fuel (usable)= 4.15 kg {2}	Delta V Remaining OR = 17.3 m/s {3}Attitude Control Duration Remaining = 11  19 years {4}Notes:{1} Fuel use 7/27/10 through Encounter includes: 	3 TCMs totaling a Delta V Mean of 4.41 m/s (1.04 kg) 	Reaction wheel desats for attitude control through 12/27 (0.13 kg) 	Safe Mode (0.05 kg) {2} Uncertainty on amount of usable fuel remaining is -0/+5.8 kg {3} Delta V Remaining calculation uses Isp = 220.6 s  this Isp is for small burns, ifburns &gt; 2m/s are used, an Isp of 227.7 can be used, which will yield 17.8 m/s {4} Attitude control duration remaining based on flight actuals: 	11 years is for worst case Science Attitude 	19 years if for Cruise Attitude In this RFI, NASA is soliciting ideas and suggestions from the science and researchcommunities on potential new uses of the Deep Impact science spacecraft that supportNASAs science goals. A new science investigation using this spacecraft should addressone or more of NASAs science objectives in any of SMDs research disciplines(Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science). NASAs scienceobjectives are described in The Science Plan for NASAs Science Mission Directorate(2007-2016), available at http://science.hq.nasa.gov/strategy/		. Note that the reuse of the Deep Impact spacecraft is not limited to a new mission in thePlanetary Science discipline, such as retargeting a planetary science mission to a newdestination, but that this request specifically includes the use of the Deep Impactspacecraft for a new science investigation in a different research discipline. This couldinclude, but is not limited to, the use of this planetary science spacecraft forheliophysics measurements or astrophysics observations.It is not the intent of this RFI to solicit observation requests, i.e. relatively modestchanges such as a single observation using the Deep Impact spacecraft for a short periodof time, but instead to solicit major and entirely new applications for existingspacecraft. With input from responses to this RFI, NASA intends to consider (i) whether there arescience opportunities for new uses of this spacecraft and (ii) whether a solicitation forproposals is warranted to enable such opportunities.If so requested in your response, all information received from this RFI will beconsidered confidential and proprietary; however NASA will use your response to aid inprogrammatic decisions about the future use of existing spacecraft and in the formulationof a potential solicitation for proposals.It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during thisRFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Actand other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary orConfidential will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planningand information purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by theGovernment to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay forinformation solicited. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>TH-57C Device 2B42A Modification Efforts
<SOLNBR>TH-57DRFI10-5-2010

<CONTACT>Mary E Munroe, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-4288, Fax 407-380-4164, Email mary.munroe@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only:
<p>The TH-57C Flight Instrument Trainer (FIT), Device 2B42A, is a motion based (Stewart configuration) simulator which replicates the cockpit of the TH-57C type model series aircraft. The simulator is utilized by the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) to train Student Naval Aviators (SNA) in intermediate and advanced helicopter training. Six devices are located in NAS Whiting Field, FL. Five of the six devices have completed a service life extension program (SLEP) and are currently supporting helicopter training for over 600 students per year. The sixth and final device will complete the SLEP effort and be returned in the Spring of 2011. The TH-57B and C type model series aircraft have begun a cockpit modernization effort which includes the incorporation of digital flight instrumentation and a new flight control stability augmentation system. Simultaneously, the cockpit avionics will be undergoing an obsolescence upgrade. These efforts will involve the total replacement of nearly all of the aircraft instrumentation and structural panels. The aircraft modifications will be accomplished during the scheduled maintenance cycles (ACI) by the aircraft Contractor Logistics Services (CLS) contractor utilizing a single kit. The resulting aircraft will be designated the TH-57D. In order to maintain concurrency with the aircraft, the six FITs must also be converted to the TH-57D configuration.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to determine the potential cost, technical challenges, and schedule requirements to modify the current FITs. The responses will also assist in identifying small businesses with sufficient capability and experience to accomplish this procurement which will be used to determine whether this procurement will be a small business set-aside. As part of this potential procurement, NAVAIR intends to provide one aircraft kit for each simulator as GFE to support this cockpit conversion effort. The contents of the aircraft kit is attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of ongoing training requirements, CNATRA must have a minimum of five simulators continuously available in order to not impact student throughput. Each training device undergoing modifications must be accepted and returned to training prior to another device being taken out of service.</p>
<p>In addition to the digital flight instrumentation and avionics, the aircraft modification kit includes a new flight control stability augmentation system (SAS) that will be incorporated in the aircraft. The functional characteristics (normal operating and malfunction) of this system as installed in the aircraft, to include an accurate aerodynamic math model, must also be modeled in the simulator. Current aerodynamic math model characteristics may also be modified to support tail rotor malfunctions/autorotation characteristics. Flight test data as available from the cockpit integrator and FAA flight test will be provided as criteria data for the SAS performance in the simulator.</p>
<p>The recently service life extended trainers also included the incorporation of Night Vision Device (NVD) compatibility. This NVD compatibility must be maintained with the incorporation of the cockpit modifications. In addition, the entire FIT working area exposed to the cockpit, to include the Instructor Operating Station (IOS), must be NVD compatible.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, upgrades/obsolescence technical refresh to the simulator computer operating systems and other subsystems impacted by the cockpit modifications must be considered and included in this effort in order to sustain the post-modified trainers. The capability to refresh navigational databases in the simulator, similar to the method that the aircraft receives updates, should also be included in the modification of the simulator and accommodated by the redesign of the computer operating system.</p>
<p>Currently the FITs provide out the window visual presentations for only the pilot seated in the right seat. The cockpit field of view must be expanded to support dual pilot out the window visual presentations. In order to address this concern, NAVAIRSYSCOM is proposing expansion or replacement of the current display system as an option to this cockpit modernization effort.</p>
<p>Contract award of this effort is anticipated in late Summer of 2011.</p>
<p>Information Requested. (Request that responses be limited to twenty pages.)</p>
<p>Please provide the top five risks or issues your company has identified that could have potential negative impact to the successful completion of this modification effort, and any risk mitigation strategies for these items.</p>
<p>Past Performance</p>
<p>Provide summary of experience within the past five years with ARINC 429 bus architecture avionics and integrating aircraft cockpit avionics into a simulator. Note potential challenges with respect to integrating aircraft hardware into simulators.</p>
<p>Provide a summary of experience within the past five years with modeling rotary wing aircraft flight characteristics.</p>
<p>Provide experience within the past five years in visual system integration, specific to modifying visual systems or replacing the system in its entirety.</p>
<p>Please provide a list of challenges within the efforts you have identified, and how they were satisfied.<br /><br />Delivery Cost and Schedule</p>
<p>Provide a financial Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate to accomplish this effort. Request that the ROM be broken into areas of: simulator cockpit avionics modification (don't include the actual cost of the avionics, this will be provided GFE); aerodynamic math modeling of the new SAS functionality and increased tail rotor malfunction and autorotation flight characteristics; modification of the simulator operating system and or other subsystems impacted by the cockpit modification; modification of trainer to ensure NVD compatibility of entire FIT area exposed to the cockpit, including the IOS; visual display system field of view increase to include the copilot seated in the left seat of the cockpit.</p>
<p>Identify a top level schedule to accomplish the above listed requirements for the six simulators. Identify where the effort will be conducted and the expected timeframe that each trainer will be taken out of service and or removed from NAS Whiting Field.</p>
<p>Company Capabilities, Processes, and Capacity</p>
<p>Considering your company's current and projected workload, please describe how your company would provide the necessary staff to accomplish the work identified. Specifically address providing the necessary staff at NAS Whiting Field, FL.</p>
<p>Please list any assumptions, conditions, or limitations that would impact your company's ability to accomplish this effort.</p>
<p>Please describe your business capacity for taking on this additional effort, taking into account current and planned workload. Describe any additional resources that are available to you to increase capacity.</p>
<p>Please provide a description of your current software engineering capacities/capabilities including staffing, organizational structure and CMMI level.</p>
<p>What predictive software tools do you use, relative to identifying the following:<br />a. To predict how much SLOC to be developed/modified/re-used<br />b. What is complexity/risk<br />c. To predict competence/qty of staff required<br />d. Length of time required to complete software changes<br />e. Expected number of DRs</p>
<p>Please provide a description of your current hardware engineering and manufacturing capacities/capabilities, including staffing and organizational structure.</p>
<p>Please provide a description of Earned Value Management (EVM) processes your company uses to maintain cost, schedule, and performance of your contracts.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a request for information only, not a solicitation, nor is it an offer to do business of any kind. Any response to this request should be undertaken at your own risk and expense.</p>
<p>Depending upon your firm's responses, the government may request a visit to your facility(s) to gain a further understanding of your capabilities.</p>
<p>To assist interested contractors in their responses, the GFE cockpit avionics list&nbsp; and&nbsp;the TH-57 Field-of-View plot are attached to this RFI.&nbsp; The&nbsp;simulator photos&nbsp;are posted on the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Business Opportunities website located at http://nawctsd.navair.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answers to the questions posed at the Market Survey conducted at NAS Whiting Field, FL are posted there as well.</p>

Description

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic is seeking eligible business firms capable of performing Design Build construction services for a Primary School at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina area as follows:

Primary Facilities:  The Tarawa Terrace I Primary School (TTI) built in 1967 is outdated, in poor condition and does not meet the latest design and construction standards.
  Tarawa Terrace II Elementary School (TTII) was built in 2001 and is on a site directly west of TTI and is in good condition.  In lieu of replacing TTI with a new facility, it has been determined that an addition to TTII will best accommodate the 300 students from TTI.

Construct a 44,276 SF addition to the existing TT II Elementary School on Camp Lejeune, North Carolina to serve Pre-K through 1st Grade students that currently attend TTI Primary School and subsequently demolish TTI Primary School. The reinforced concrete/steel elementary school addition will include general purpose classrooms, a gymnasium, special education classrooms, and increases to support areas to accommodate the additional enrollment.
  The scope will include changes to the utilities and advanced communications systems to support technology requirements as well as general communications.  New site amenities will include additional parking and access drives, a secondary drop-off with covered walkway, playgrounds, hard court, signage, fencing, landscaping, security lighting and service/equipment yards with screen walls. These facilities shall be designed in accordance with DoDEA Education Facilities Specifications, AT/FP standards, Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines, National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code, Standards of Seismic Safety for Federally Owned Buildings, and energy conservation standards.

<DESC><br />Description<br />The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting a sources sought notice to identify business concerns capable of conducting research in advanced laser technology for potential implementation into the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These lasers will address safety recommendations to ensure the integrity of National Airspace Safety (NAS) safety. This task shall address how laser based infrared-runway visual range (IR-RVR) concepts will enhance safety in the NAS and demonstrate a clear path towards integration and operation in the NAS. Throughout this task the company will consider the interface of laser based IR RVR technology in controller/pilot situational awareness.
<p>Draft a conceptual plan that analyzes the capabilities of existing Enhanced Vision Systems (EVS) technology and compare these capabilities to conventional RVR visibility measurements. This plan will:</p>
<p>&bull; Describe the concept of installing EVS sensors on a fixed tower simulating an approximate 3 degree glide slope similar to most Instrument Landing Systems (ILS)<br />&bull; Describe a reference IR laser(s) that measures visibility at multiple IR spectra<br />&bull; Identify the availability of IR lasers near the 5 micron and 10 micron bands<br />&bull; Determine costs of above lasers to include the procedures for installation, maintenance, operations, calibration, and safety aspects of the lasers<br />&bull; Describe the data collection process to include the type of data to be collected and frequency of collection<br />&bull; Describe the employment of software to interface to the advanced laser technology and how that software would be employed and integrated in the NAS.</p>
<p>Background<br />Runway Visual Range (RVR) information is now used to inform controllers and pilots of visibility conditions for guidance during takeoffs and landings. Consequently RVR information impacts the safety and efficiency of airport operations. In addition to providing guidance during landings, in the future, EVS technology could be used to execute taxi operations under low-visibility conditions. This would require an infrared visibility sensor to determine visibility on taxiways as well as runways. Accordingly, the Navigation Services Office requires expertise on: sensors used for the generation of Infrared RVR products; means/methods of interpreting phenomena such as fog, snow and haze conditions that reduce airport visibility; and assistance in testing sensors and evaluating performance of EVS related technology under diverse weather conditions. The Volpe Center has been a prime resource for the provision of such services with conventional RVR systems for nearly two decades, and has extensive experience with operational use of infrared visibility sensors. <br />The Volpe Center's contributions to the FAA's RVR Program include: <br />(1) Operation and maintenance of the Otis Weather Test Facility (WTF) on Cape Cod, Massachusetts for the testing and evaluation of the performance of visibility sensors and ambient light sensors in support of the New Generation Runway Visibility System (NG-RVR) and the PC-Based Runway Visual Range System (PC-RVR); <br />(2) Archiving, analysis and interpretation of data obtained at the Otis WTF and at other test sites throughout the Continental United States (CONUS) to ensure proper operation of sensors and systems and to evaluate plausible future concepts of operation; <br />(3) Consultation on related data processing algorithms such as those based on Koschmieder's Law and Allard's Law that are the bases for computing RVR values; <br />(4) Conduct of related studies on airport lighting concepts, potential methods of mitigating the impacts of a failed RVR visibility sensor at an airport and ways of reducing loss of service in snowfall conditions.</p>
<p>Period of Performance &amp; Deliverables<br />The period of performance for this SOW is from the date of execution through March 31, 2011. Task 1, Concept of Operations document, will be delivered by Dec 1, 2010. No travel is expected.</p>
<p>The Volpe Center is seeking capability information. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS or QUALIFICATIONS. Do not include any pricing information.

<DESC>The 409th Contracting Support Brigade (Europe), in support of Joint Multinational Simulation Center (JMSC), is seeking industry feedback/comments on documents associated with the upcoming solicitation for the Battle Simulation Training Contract.  The Performance Work Statement (PWS) and the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) are attached for your review.  The following are objectives that are important to the Government in this procurement.  The Government envisions a contract that offers as much fixed price as possible and offers less Government administrative burden.  The contract must be flexible due to the numerous exercises and events and the numerous changes during these events; however, the Government also believes that we will benefit from contract incentives, a stable workforce and continuity.  The Government is looking for an approach that offers the best overall value.  The Government's goal is to prepare a solicitation that meets all of these objectives as a result of Industry feedback from the draft PWS, from the draft PRS, and from Industry Day.  Potential offerors opportunity to ask questions, to address inconsistencies and ambiguities, to make suggestions, and to influence this procurement will be during this process.<BR><BR>For the requirements in the PWS, the Government requests input from industry as to contract type(s), possible CLIN structure, possible incentives, feedback on the requirements themselves, and the risks to both the Government and Industry associated with the different possible approaches.  Please support suggestions with narratives and any alternate solutions.  Industry is also invited to provide any other comments/suggestions that industry feels will be beneficial to the acquisition process.  <BR><BR>Industry Day:  <BR><BR>Interested businesses are hereby invited to participate in an Industry Day session and one-on-one sessions beginning on 20 October 2010 and continuing through 21 October 2010 for an upcoming solicitation.  An information briefing will be provided in the morning of 20 October with one-on-one sessions scheduled that afternoon and throughout the day of 21 October.  One-on-one sessions will be scheduled on a first come, first served basis.  These sessions will be held in BLDG 1484, Camp Aachen, Grafenwoehr starting at 0830 hours (08:30).  <BR><BR>Participation is limited to five (5) personnel per company. The Government will not compensate industry participants for travel, lodging or any other expenses associated with the pre-proposal conference.<BR><BR>For registration at Industry Day, please submit the attached Registration Form via email to Kathleen Boyer, E-mail kathleen.boyer@eur.army.mil and Cc to Ms. Joy Lloyd at joy.lloyd@eur.army.mil with email subject line as: JMSC BST Industry Day.  <BR><BR>Registration must be submitted no later than 13 October 2010.  Due to briefing locations and security requirements, registration submissions received after 13 October 2010 will not be accepted. You will be registered and provided with a Visitor Package detailing the meeting location and access instructions for the conference. <BR><BR>The purpose of this conference is to brief Industry on the requirements for the Battle Simulations Training Contract and to give Industry an opportunity to provide input on these requirements as well as on the contract type, structure, possible incentive approach and the risks associated with the this program.  Industry will also have an opportunity to suggest briefing topics using the registration form.  The Government prefers that these sessions be very interactive, with questions and input provided throughout the process.  However, questions and topics submitted prior Industry Day have a better chance of being addressed.  Also, we request that Industry provide a written record to the Government of any questions asked during the sessions within 5 days of the sessions.   <BR><BR>During the one-on-one sessions, information received from Industry that will go to shape the procurement may be utilized in forming our solicitation.  If a member of Industry discusses proprietary information during the one-on-one sessions, it is incumbent upon that member to ensure that the Government understands the proprietary nature of the discussion.<BR><BR>As a result of Industry Day and your review of the PWS and PRS, please provide all of your recommendations, suggestions and written record of questions from Industry to Ms. Kathleen Boyer, e-mail kathleen.boyer@eur.army.mil and to Ms. Joy Lloyd at joy.lloyd@eur.army.mil with email subject line as: JMSC BST Input, no later than 8 November 2010.  The Government will accept responses after this date but it would be beneficial to the overall process to have the comments before 8 November 2010.<BR><BR>This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  No solicitation document exists at this time and the Government does not plan to provide responses to industry relating to information provided.  The information obtained as a result of this process is for Planning Purposes Only. <BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science MissionDirectorate (SMD) intends to release a letter of invitation for membership on the ScienceDefinition Team (SDT) for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST).OVERVIEW OF THE WFIRST SDT OPPORTUNITYIt is anticipated that the WFIRST Dear Colleague Letter will invite applications formembership on the Science Definition Team for the WFIRST mission, a strategic missionsponsored by NASAs Astrophysics Division, recommended as the top priority large projectby the National Research Councils Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics, entitledNew Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics (the Astro2010 Decadal Survey,available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951	).  WFIRST will be awide-field near-infrared space telescope capable of performing imaging and spectroscopicsky surveys with multiple goals including gravitational microlensing surveys forexoplanets, large-area sky survey and deep surveys for research in dark energy, and otherextragalactic and galactic research programs.The members of the WFIRST SDT will provide NASA with scientific assistance duringpreliminary concept definition (Pre-Phase A) activities.  Near-term activities of the SDTmembers will focus primarily on assessing the scientific approach to investigating thegoals of the WFIRST space mission as outlined by the Astro2010 Decadal Survey.Participation in the WFIRST SDT will be open to all qualified and interested individuals.THE WFIRST MISSIONAs envisaged by the Astro2010 Decadal Survey, WFIRST will be a 1.5-meter-classwide-field-of-view near-infrared-imaging and low-resolution-spectroscopy space telescope. WFIRST will be capable of addressing fundamental questions about the nature of darkenergy.  It will employ three distinct techniques  measurements of weak gravitationallensing, supernova distances, and baryon acoustic oscillations  to determine the effectof dark energy on the evolution of the universe.  An equally important goal of themission will be to open up a new frontier of exoplanet studies by monitoring a largesample of stars in the central bulge of the Milky Way for changes in brightness due tomicrolensing by intervening planetary systems.	WFIRST will also be used to support avigorous guest investigator program of additional extragalactic and galactic researchusing its near-infrared capabilities.DETAILS OF THE PLANNED REQUESTNASA anticipates releasing a Dear Colleague Letter that invites applications formembership on the WFIRST SDT.  The Letter will request that each application should be nomore than two pages in length.	The application should describe the applicants currentresearch activities, including participation in major collaborations relevant to thegoals of WFIRST.  Specific areas of expertise should be described, including topics inmicrolensing and surveys for exoplanets, dark energy observations and theory, figure ofmerit forecasting for dark energy and exoplanet surveys, focal plane instrumentation, andinfrared sky survey science relevant to WFIRST.  SDT members are expected to beknowledgeable in observational and/or theoretical astrophysics in the fields relevant todefining and focusing the scientific objectives of the WFIRST mission.NASAs charge to the SDT will be to provide science requirements, investigationapproaches, key mission parameters, and any other scientific inputs needed to support thedesign of an optimized space mission concept satisfying the overall goals of the WFIRSTmission as outlined by the Astro2010 Decadal Survey.  Justification for conducting theWFIRST investigations from space and an assessment of how such investigations willcomplement existing and planned domestic and international ground and space facilitieswill be included in the SDTs report.  Additional details will be described in the DearColleague Letter and associated SDT charter.All meetings of the WFIRST SDT will be open, all reports and other output of the WFIRSTSDT will be made publicly available, and the WFIRST SDT will be disbanded prior to anyfuture Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for participation in the WFIRST mission includingprovision of instruments.The following schedule describes the anticipated major milestones of NASAs DearColleague Letter for application to the WFIRST Science Definition Team.  These dates aresubject to change.  Dear Colleague Letter released:  Mid-October 2010Application Due Date:  Release + 1 monthSelections Announced (target):	Release + 2 monthsThe issuance of this Community Announcement does not obligate NASA to issue the DearColleague Letter and solicit applications.  Any costs incurred by prospectiveinvestigators in preparing submissions in response to this Community Announcement areincurred completely at the submitter's own risk.

Fiber lasers are advantageous both because of lower cost and lower maintenance (compared to competing technologies). With the improved technology, industry is producing increasingly powerful fiber lasers. Commercial fiber lasers are now available in the 10 kW range. However, theoretical computer modeling at LLNL indicates that single fiber technology will not be able to exceed 30 kW (because of non-linear and thermal problems). This has lead LLNL researchers to invent a new technology for a Multiple-Core Ribbon Fiber Laser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Some of the cores are doped with a lasing impurity, while other cores are doped with index-increasing impurities. The doping of these adjacent cores is designed to promote antiguiding and leaky modes which provide higher laser gain and more robust single supermode operation. Another aspect of the invention is that the ribbon laser is pumped from the side with a simple optical arrangement which doesn't require intensification of the pump laser diode output beam. This laser can be used as an oscillator or amplifier, and is intended to provide for high power operation, many times higher than possible with single core fibers.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Affymetrix, Inc., 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051. National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires maintenance on models: #GCS (S/N #74900234), 640 (S/N #12386), FS450U (S/N #FS0290), WS-SYS (S/N #F4RLFG1), GC30007G (S/N #50209150, AUTOLOADER (S/N #A13720), and FS3450 (S/N #60123080. Affymetrix is producing gene arrays that contain 1,000,000 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), the only arrays commercially available at that density. Analysis of SNP's in the human genome is crucial to our studies of drug abuse vulnerability loci. This gets close to reasonable power for detection of most of the addiction vulnerability loci in our samples, according to our modeling. The addition of this approach to our ongoing studies will put us in the forefront of drug abuse related genetic research. In accordance with FAR6.302-1, the supplies required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, Affymetrix, Inc. and no other supplier will satisfy the agency requirements. There are no licensed systems or instruments offered by third party providers that are able to use any components of the Affymetrix, Gene Chip System, including arrays. The highest SNP density commercially available is needed to identify drug abuse vulnerability loci and prove or disprove the idea of polygenic contributions of common allelic variants to drug abuse vulnerability.
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing notification number NIHDA2011101must be submitted by October 15, 2010 to NIH, NIDA, IRP, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 200, BRC Bldg., Rm 04A326, Baltimore, MD 21224, ATTN: John Johnson.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302, 5.2, and 17.207(4) this notice advertises the government's intent to exercise option year four (final option year) of a five year contract to Cameron Cattle Company, Inc.  The option year will be in effect from October 21, 2010 through April 1, 2011.  The original award included a base year and four option years.  The original award was made in accordance with FAR 6.302, Other Than Full and Open Competition, and FAR 12, Commercial Item Acquisition.
The contractor provides the following:  1) At least 30 acres of dry pasture and shelter from the weather.  Shelter consists of heavy tree cover and/or barn, or other structure adequate to provide covered protection.  2) A constant source of clean water.  3)  An adequate supply of stored hay to supplement pasture. 4) Makes daily welfare checks for each mule and immediately notify the COR in the event of injuries, accidents or health issues.  4) Adequate fencing with secure gates.  Contractor takes all reasonable measures to prevent access to stock by third parties.  5)  Contractor is (and shall be) located within  hour drive of Port Angeles to enable quick, drive-by inspections by various members of Olympic National Park's trail crew to ensure the mules are being cared for in the manner expected, such as receiving adequate food and water, and are healthy in appearance.   The reason for the close proximity to Port Angeles is to ensure that the Olympic National Park trail crew staff can make routine trips to the contractor's land for attending to the mules, such as trimming feet, responding to reported illness or injury, and/or addressing any other problems the contractor has notified the COR about during the winter months.  The proximity would also ensure a generally mild winter due to being located within Port Angeles' "rain shadow."
Comments and questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Phaedra Fuller, Contracting Officer, at phaedra_fuller@nps.gov.  Include your business name, qualifications, and point of contact.  All comments received before October 13, 2009 will be considered.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to procure limited quantities of an articulated sensor with a third axis of motion for Eddy Current test equipment. The articulated sensor will be attached to existing non-destructive Eddy Current test equipment located at Dynamic Flowform, Billerica, MA and Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, MD. This procurement will be sole-sourced to Laser Techniques Company (LTC),  742 185th Avenue NE, Suite 300, Redmond, Washington, 98052. This procurement supports an acquisition of systems previously developed, tested, and produced by LTC for testing purposes of the 81mm mortar tubes at the Dynamic Flowform facility. As the developer and sole producer of the Eddy Current system utilized by Dynamic Flowform, LTC alone has the unique specific knowledge of the system design modifications necessary to satisfy the USMC requirement.

<DESC>FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data, including unique high quality data on the safety, effectiveness and performance of drugs, biologics and devices, both pre- and post-approval. These data are not collected or stored in standardized format and, for this reason, cannot be evaluated across multiple studies, products or populations except with great difficulty. The goal of this project is to collaboratively build and use the standards, infrastructure (including scientific capacity), tools and policies needed to receive process and analyze this clinical study data. The infrastructure and approaches developed as a result of this project will enable pilots of comparative effectiveness and other complex research and evaluation using the agency's vast, but untapped, stores of patient safety and clinical efficacy data.
<p>The availability of a data warehouse for storing, organizing, and extracting scientific data about regulated products in a common "language" or format to support regulatory decision making underpins the success of any broader initiatives to comparatively evaluate product performance. This data warehouse will be developed in the Janus program.</p>
<p>At its full capacity, Janus will be a comprehensive clinical trial and population health data warehouse that facilitates access to and analysis of 21st century data sources (e.g., large quantity digital data that come from new imaging and "omics" technologies), and collation of that data with other sources of information on medical product effectiveness, safety, and quality. Janus will be interoperable with clinical (i.e., electronic health record) and other data sources and will include protocols for secure and reliable data storage and access, and analytic tools for data analysis.</p>
<p>FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) (http://www.fda.gov/Cder/) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) (http://www.fda.gov/CBER/) have been involved in the Janus development initiative since 2006, when the first of several iterative pilot projects for clinical trials data was launched jointly by FDA (http://www.fda.gov) and the NCI (http://www.cancer.gov/) through an Interagency Oncology Task Force (IOTF) (http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/relatedinitiatives/overview/iotf.asp). This pilot, funded primarily by NCI, has gone through several iterations since 2006.<br />Phase 1 of the project, which included requirements gathering, creation of a prototype environment, and implementation of the database as a proof of concept, was completed in January 2006. The Phase 2 operational pilot, which involved integration of two reviewer tools (PhaseForward Lincoln Technologies' WebSDM [http://www.phaseforward.com/products/clinical/ads/default.aspx] and Integrated Clinical Systems, Inc.'s JReview [http://www.i-review.com/index.php]) with the repository, included development of a validation and import facility, loading of validated datasets into the repository, and creation of analytical views (e.g., Study Data Tabulation Model [SDTM] views) to facilitate reviewer access to data maintained in the repository. Following completion of the work on this pilot in March 2007, NCI provided additional "gap" funding so that the team could continue to load SDTM submissions while the planning for the Phase 3 pilot occurred. <br />Phase 1 of Janus resulted in a proof of concept prototype. Janus Phase 2 established an essential architecture and concept of operations for Janus implementation. Phase 3 of the Janus pilot at NCI will include the tasks needed to implement an operational environment that supports the automatic validation, loading, and management of standard clinical trials data in the Janus repository and reviewer access to that data for comparative effectiveness research using the JReview and WebSDM reviewer tools.</p>
<p>The requirement of Phase 3 of the pilot at NCI will address tasks needed to transition to an operational environment that supports the review and analysis of clinical trials data for comparative effectiveness research-this operational environment will include the extraction, validation, loading, and management of clinical trial data in CDISC-compliant SDTM format into the Janus repository.</p>
<p>Key objectives are to:</p>
<p>&bull; Redesign, test, and implement the Janus database based on an updated logical data model that supports improved data integrity, relationships, and analytical functions. This work will include updating the specifications and services required to validate SDTM datasets, populate the Janus database, and create SDTM materialized views.<br />&bull; Develop a "standalone" STDM Validation Service that can be made publicly available to clinical trial sponsors to enable validation of their data sets using the same criteria to be applied by Janus. To accomplish this objective the Subcontractor will develop this service to the level where it has been in production, tested to work with early adopters, and can be easily deployed with appropriate documentation and minimal support. This service will not load data into the Janus repository as it is intended to be used as a preview or check of draft data sets before actual submission to FDA. Once data sets pass the SDTM Validation, sponsors will be able to submit them to Janus via the FDA gateway.<br />&bull; Develop a Load Service to automatically load data sets that are submitted to Janus and "pass" the SDTM validation checks via the integrated STDM Validation service into the Oracle database. An exception handling process for select datasets will be a component of this service.<br />&bull; Continue technical and operational support for the incremental loading and testing of converted legacy datasets or new SDTM datasets concurrently with Janus database redesign activities.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) in support of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG&reg;) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number RECOVERY - ARRAOS: ST10-1094 for an initiative called, "Quality Assurance Support for the Janus Software Development Project and the Janus Phase 3 Infrastructure Development and Implementation for FDA." <br />
<p><strong>PROPOSALS ARE DUE BY 4:00 PM EDT JULY 2, 2010.&nbsp; EMAIL QUESTIONS AND/OR CLARIFICATIONS IN WRITING TO THE POINT OF CONTACT NAMED ABOVE BY 12:00 PM EDT JUNE 21, 2010.<br /></strong><br />The scope of this project is to acquire Subcontractor support to provide Quality Assurance (QA) support for the Janus software development project; Janus Infrastructure Development and Implementation for FDA ARRAOS (Janus Phase III) and whose main scope and objectives are described below for context. The work includes comprehensive testing and QA support for all aspects and phases of the Janus Phase III project. Application functionality testing and testing of interfaces to other systems, as well as, relevant Enterprise Services in the caBIG Service Portfolio. A more specific project service list will grow throughout the project lifecycle, and is being added to project documentation and deliverables accessible at https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/projects/janus-iii/, and is within scope of this request. <br />The National Cancer Institute's Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology Quality Assurance (NCI CBIIT QA) staff oversee's the analysis, coordination, planning and facilitation of quality test plans and quality testing for the quality assurance (QA) environments designated by each application project's plan, and implemented by selected independent QA contractor(s), NCI CBIIT QA actively insures that the selected independent QA contractor adheres to all NCI CBIIT policies and procedures, uses the testing paradigms and standards that are acceptable to NCI CBIIT, and provides communication to NCI leadership regarding best /avoid practices and the overall health of the project quality. NCI CBIIT QA actively insures that through the selected independent QA contractor the final application and services will provide acceptable functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability, as well as oversight and review of certification and accreditation of systems.<br />The National Cancer Institute's Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology has been actively defining, designing, developing, and deploying key infrastructure and application-level components of the IT fabric necessary to support the 21st-Century vision for integrated Biomedical Research, Translational Medicine and Personalized Health Management, a composite environment and context often referred to as the " Oncology Knowledge Cloud." In particular, the Knowledge Cloud is being developed with a focus on developing and deploying reference implementations of specifications developed to support and enable "Business Interoperability" between stakeholders throughout the Knowledge Cloud. In particular, development activities are focused on utilizing a variety of standards that support technical interoperability, as well as on utilizing a number of Best Practices drawn from the collective experiences in both the commercial and open-source software engineering communities. The software components deployed by CBIIT will be based on a commitment to open-source, open-access development with the goal of promoting the maximum amount of sharing and integration. In addition, however, components will be specified in such a manner so as to enable bindings to non-CBIIT technology platforms in other commercial or open-source implementations.<br />It is anticipated that the Janus development project will process legacy and newly created Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) study data sets as submissions, validate the submission against standard rules and automate the processing of the SDTM datasets from the time they are made available for loading from FDA's electronic document rooms (EDR) through their validation and loading into the Janus clinical study data repository. In addition, the Janus development project will enhance the Janus database (to v 2.0) to a more robust database design and improved analytical and visualization functions. <br />The QA of all associated development iterations and releases will be required in appropriate testing environments to move to next step in the development and deployment lifecycle, as determined by project team and project management plan. <br />In progress, are the gathering of requirements and system design documents for Janus phase 3 system, including the 2.0 database model and a SDTM Validation Service (which will automatically load new SDTM datasets into a staging area, perform SDTM validation checks, generate error reports describing all errors, and send them to FDA-designated recipients) from extension of the Janus Phase II pilot.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to provide all aspects of Software Quality Assurance (QA) support for the Janus system throughout its full software development lifecycle. In this request the subcontractor is asked to provide a variety of management and QA services including but not limited to: <br />(a) Work with development teams to produce and maintain appropriate QA and testing plans for new releases of software: <br />(b) Work with development teams and end users to produce test cases: <br />(c) Conduct integration testing, regression and staging testing of software prior to release: <br />(d) Test case automation: <br />(e) Assist with user acceptance testing of software prior to release: <br />(f) Support for Bug Fixes: <br />(g) Troubleshoot Data Issues: <br />(h) Deliver Test Reports: <br />(i) Formal systems validation is not included within the scope of this request.<br />(j) As the system may be validated in the future any design or errors that would prevent or hinder validation known, or anticipated, should be brought to the attention of the project manager for consideration in development.<br />&bull; Test the Phase 3 operational pilot's ability to function as a study data warehouse to support comparative effectiveness analysis of clinical trials data. Using test data provided by FDA identify errors and operational deficiencies.</p>
<p><br />Design and development of the system will be performed by a separate subcontractor under a separate contract. It is expected that the awardee(s) of this contract will interact with the development and architecture teams and any open source developers, to insure all found errors and bugs are eliminated, as part of this QA work; or formulate mitigation strategies (plans), to be designed and approved , by both FDA and NCI.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>This RFP is issued by SAIC-Frederick and is ARRA funded.<br /></strong><strong><br />PHONE CALLS REGARDING THIS RFP WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. OFFERORS SHOULD EMAIL THE IDENTIFIED SUBCONTRACT SPECIALIST ONLY.<br /></strong><strong><br />Questions regarding the RFP should be emailed to the Subcontracts Specialist by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 14, 2010.<br /></strong><strong><br />Proposals are due to the Subcontracts Specialist by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 1, 2010.<br /></strong><br />SAIC-Frederick is pleased to announce a new solicitation available in support of the Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (OBBR) and its cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) initiative.<br /><br />Through an advanced network of tissue acquisition, biorepository operations, pathology review, and bioinformatics capabilities, caHUB will provide the high-quality, clinically annotated biospecimens that are essential resources to accelerate the development of molecular-based diagnostics and therapeutics for personalized medicine. This funding is made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), Pub. L. No. 111-5.<br /><br />SAIC-Frederick is seeking a pool of qualified candidates for award of a basic ordering agreement (BOA) to serve as biospecimen source sites (BSSs) for the procurement of cancer biospecimens, providing prospectively collected, clinically annotated cancer biospecimens from consented patient cases to the cancer Human Biobank (caHUB). Offerors may represent single BSS institutions or a network of BSSs. To meet the caHUB's goals, SAIC-F will establish a BOA with several organizations capable of recruiting targeted cancer patients from CoC-accredited institutions and delivering clinically annotated biospecimens. (BSSs contributing biospecimens to the caHUB must hold CoC-accreditation.) Under this BOA, task orders may be competed to acquire targeted cancer tissues, associated blood, collection, handling and processing data, and clinical data for the caHUB.<br /><br />The strategic goal of the caHUB is to meet the Nation's need for the highest quality, well-annotated biospecimens for cancer research. To meet this need, a network of biospecimen source sites (BSSs) will be established to provide the highest quality clinically annotated biospecimens to the caHUB. "High quality" refers not only to the histological and molecular properties of the tissue but also to characteristics such as degree and quality of clinical annotation, the existence of appropriate informed consent provisions and material transfer agreements for the intended use of the biomolecules and data, standardized collection and processing procedures, and subsequent distribution under a caHUB-reviewed protocol as well as unencumbered access for research use&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) in support of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG&reg;) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number RECOVERY - ARRAOS: ST10-1094 for an initiative called, "Quality Assurance Support for the Janus Software Development Project and the Janus Phase 3 Infrastructure Development and Implementation for FDA." <br />
<p><strong>PROPOSALS ARE DUE BY 4:00 PM EDT JULY 2, 2010.&nbsp; EMAIL QUESTIONS AND/OR CLARIFICATIONS IN WRITING TO THE POINT OF CONTACT BY 12:00 PM EDT JUNE 21, 2010.<br /></strong><br />The scope of this project is to acquire Subcontractor support to provide Quality Assurance (QA) support for the Janus software development project; Janus Infrastructure Development and Implementation for FDA ARRAOS (Janus Phase III) and whose main scope and objectives are described below for context. The work includes comprehensive testing and QA support for all aspects and phases of the Janus Phase III project. Application functionality testing and testing of interfaces to other systems, as well as, relevant Enterprise Services in the caBIG Service Portfolio. A more specific project service list will grow throughout the project lifecycle, and is being added to project documentation and deliverables accessible at https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/projects/janus-iii/, and is within scope of this request. <br />The National Cancer Institute's Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology Quality Assurance (NCI CBIIT QA) staff oversee's the analysis, coordination, planning and facilitation of quality test plans and quality testing for the quality assurance (QA) environments designated by each application project's plan, and implemented by selected independent QA contractor(s), NCI CBIIT QA actively insures that the selected independent QA contractor adheres to all NCI CBIIT policies and procedures, uses the testing paradigms and standards that are acceptable to NCI CBIIT, and provides communication to NCI leadership regarding best /avoid practices and the overall health of the project quality. NCI CBIIT QA actively insures that through the selected independent QA contractor the final application and services will provide acceptable functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability, as well as oversight and review of certification and accreditation of systems.<br />The National Cancer Institute's Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology has been actively defining, designing, developing, and deploying key infrastructure and application-level components of the IT fabric necessary to support the 21st-Century vision for integrated Biomedical Research, Translational Medicine and Personalized Health Management, a composite environment and context often referred to as the " Oncology Knowledge Cloud." In particular, the Knowledge Cloud is being developed with a focus on developing and deploying reference implementations of specifications developed to support and enable "Business Interoperability" between stakeholders throughout the Knowledge Cloud. In particular, development activities are focused on utilizing a variety of standards that support technical interoperability, as well as on utilizing a number of Best Practices drawn from the collective experiences in both the commercial and open-source software engineering communities. The software components deployed by CBIIT will be based on a commitment to open-source, open-access development with the goal of promoting the maximum amount of sharing and integration. In addition, however, components will be specified in such a manner so as to enable bindings to non-CBIIT technology platforms in other commercial or open-source implementations.<br />It is anticipated that the Janus development project will process legacy and newly created Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) study data sets as submissions, validate the submission against standard rules and automate the processing of the SDTM datasets from the time they are made available for loading from FDA's electronic document rooms (EDR) through their validation and loading into the Janus clinical study data repository. In addition, the Janus development project will enhance the Janus database (to v 2.0) to a more robust database design and improved analytical and visualization functions. <br />The QA of all associated development iterations and releases will be required in appropriate testing environments to move to next step in the development and deployment lifecycle, as determined by project team and project management plan. <br />In progress, are the gathering of requirements and system design documents for Janus phase 3 system, including the 2.0 database model and a SDTM Validation Service (which will automatically load new SDTM datasets into a staging area, perform SDTM validation checks, generate error reports describing all errors, and send them to FDA-designated recipients) from extension of the Janus Phase II pilot.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to provide all aspects of Software Quality Assurance (QA) support for the Janus system throughout its full software development lifecycle. In this request the subcontractor is asked to provide a variety of management and QA services including but not limited to: <br />(a) Work with development teams to produce and maintain appropriate QA and testing plans for new releases of software: <br />(b) Work with development teams and end users to produce test cases: <br />(c) Conduct integration testing, regression and staging testing of software prior to release: <br />(d) Test case automation: <br />(e) Assist with user acceptance testing of software prior to release: <br />(f) Support for Bug Fixes: <br />(g) Troubleshoot Data Issues: <br />(h) Deliver Test Reports: <br />(i) Formal systems validation is not included within the scope of this request.<br />(j) As the system may be validated in the future any design or errors that would prevent or hinder validation known, or anticipated, should be brought to the attention of the project manager for consideration in development.<br />&bull; Test the Phase 3 operational pilot's ability to function as a study data warehouse to support comparative effectiveness analysis of clinical trials data. Using test data provided by FDA identify errors and operational deficiencies.</p>
<p><br />Design and development of the system will be performed by a separate subcontractor under a separate contract. It is expected that the awardee(s) of this contract will interact with the development and architecture teams and any open source developers, to insure all found errors and bugs are eliminated, as part of this QA work; or formulate mitigation strategies (plans), to be designed and approved , by both FDA and NCI.</p>

<p>(a) During the term of this contract, the Contractor shall post a notice, of such size and in such form, and containing such content as prescribed by the Secretary of Labor, in conspicuous places in and about its plants and offices where employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act engage in activities relating to the performance of the contract, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted both physically and electronically, in the languages employees speak, in accordance with 29 CFR 471.2 (d) and (f).<br /><br />(1) Physical posting of the employee notice shall be in conspicuous places in and about the Contractor's plants and offices so that the notice is prominent and readily seen by employees who are covered by the National Labor Relations Act and engage in activities related to the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(2) If the Contractor customarily posts notices to employees electronically, then the Contractor shall also post the required notice electronically by displaying prominently, on any website that is maintained by the Contractor and is customarily used for notices to employees about terms and conditions of employment, a link to the Department of Labor's website that contains the full text of the poster. The link to the Department's website, as reference in (b) (3) of the section, must read, "Important Notice about Employee Rights to Organize and Bargain Collectively with Their Employers."</p>
<p>(b) This required notice, printed by the Department of Labor, may be -</p>
<p>(1) Obtained from the Division of Interpretations and Standards, Office of Labor-Management Standards, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-5609, Washington, DC 20210, (202) 693-0123, or from any field office of the Office of Labor-Management Standards or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs;<br /><br />(2) Provided by the Federal contracting agency, if requested;</p>

<p>(e) In the event that the Contractor does not comply with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause, this contract may be terminated or suspended in whole or in part, and the Contractor may be suspended or debarred in accordance with 29 CFR 471.14 and FAR Subpart 9.4. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided by 29 CFR Part 471, which implements E.O. 13496 or as otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p>(f) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (f), in every subcontract that exceeds $10,000 and will be performed wholly or partially in the United States, unless exempted by the rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order 13496 of January 30, 2009, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not procure supplies or services in a way designed to avoid the applicability of Executive Order 13496 or this clause.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non compliance.</p>
<p>(4) However, if the Contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the Contractor may request the United States, through the Secretary of Labor, to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>*** UPDATE 12 APR 10 ***</strong></p>
<p>Note: This is the same effort referenced on FedBizOpps # FA8622-09-D-5999-0100 and PIXS6441.</p>
<p>This notice is a follow-on sources sought synopsis to FBO # PIXS6441 posted on 23 Feb 10. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract.</p>
<p><strong>All substantive portions of the 23 Feb 10 sources sought synopsis are incorporated by reference. The purpose of this follow-on sources sought synopsis is to clarify FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting." Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." It is the intention of the government to pursue the standard FAR clause language, wherein the small business prime contractor must intend to perform and demonstrate the capability to perform at least 50 percent of the entire scope of work described in the draft Performance Work Statement.</strong></p>
<p>Companies that responded to the 23 Feb 10 sources sought synopsis, please respond with your company name and confirm your interest in acting as a prime contractor or subcontractor, considering ability to comply with FAR 52.219-14. It is not necessary to resubmit any other information unless there has been a change.</p>

<DESC>The following questions have been asked:
<p>1. The solicitation says draft. Will there be a final released, or is this the final RFP?</p>
<p>- The document posted is the final release.</p>
<p>2. Does the past performance count as part of the 5 page limitation on the technical?</p>
<p>- No. Past performance and the technical eval are separate items.</p>
<p>3. Is the past performance a different section?</p>
<p>- Yes</p>
<p>4. Do we need to submit a Safety and Health Plan with our submission?</p>
<p>- Yes</p>
<p>5. If so, does that count towards the 5 page technical?</p>
<p>- It is separate from the 5 page technical.</p>
<p>6. The RFP lists that there is an incumbent. Can they please identify the name of the company? Can we get the contact information for the person currently working in that position?</p>
<p>- There is an incumbent, but I will not be able to provide you with any other information other than that.</p>
<p>7. Under CLIN Item 0001 it states that the Nurse Case Manager is a Credentialed Healthcare Worker. Will the Nurse Case Manager have to be credentialed? If so, can you please define what credentialing items you will need?</p>
<p>- This is a non-credentialed position. A change to the Solicitation reflecting this will be posted.</p>
<p>8. Section 4.2.4 LIFE SUPPORT CERTIFICATION states that BLS is required. It further states that ACLS will be required by all credentialed healthcare workers. Will the Nurse Case Manager be required to carry ACLS?</p>
<p>- Only BLS will be required.</p>
<p>9. Page 22 - Safety and Health Plan - Since this is a personal services contract, can we assume that the Nurse Case Manager will fall under the same safety plan that is outlined for all MTF personnel?</p>
<p>- The Safety Plan must address the Appendix C that was issued with the solicitation.</p>
<p>10. Do you need a copy of the RN's resume in the proposal?</p>
<p>- No</p>
<p>11. What is "Signal Code: A" in section B of the RFP?</p>
<p>- Government informational purposes only.</p>
<p>12. Can we submit the proposal by electronics? Or hard copy only?</p>
<p>- Yes. Electronic is preferred.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) <br />Army Mobile Device Application Development Services
<p><br />The U.S. Army Contracting Command National Capital Region Contracting Center (NCRCC) is seeking information for the purpose of obtaining market research only. <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to help the Army better understand current and future market solutions, availability of services, industry best practices, technical characteristics and functionality of information technology (IT) services, tools, and products capable of enhancing and/or extending the Army's efforts to develop a software development contract for mobile device applications. Subsequent to the receipt of responses to this RFI, the Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) may invite select RFI respondents to a technical interchange session to discuss their response with Government representatives. <br />This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition. All information received from this RFI will be used for Market Research purposes only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this RFI nor otherwise reimburse vendors for the preparation of any information submitted or Government use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified regarding the outcome of the information received.<br />1.1. Army PEO EIS Background<br />The Army PEO EIS provides infrastructure and information management systems to the Army, enabling it to achieve victory through total information dominance. PEO EIS develops, acquires and deploys tactical and management information technology systems and products. PEO EIS is a systems acquisition, development and integration center of excellence under the management of four deputy program executive officers, five directorates and numerous project/product managers. PEO EIS develops and fields a wide range of products and services that support the Army and, through its diverse programs, touches every soldier, every day. <br />1.2. Army PEO EIS Mobile Applications Vision<br />The Army recognizes the great benefits that mobile applications can provide to meeting mission objectives, and supporting the war-fighter and the greater Army community. PEO EIS envisions itself as the "one-stop shop" within the Army for providing these secure and scalable mobile application products to the Army community. PEO EIS understands that effectively providing mobile application products to its customers goes beyond simply developing these applications for them. It entails providing a full lifecycle of mobile application capabilities starting from concept development through product design, requirements identification, application development, integration with back-end systems, security and information assurance, deployment, hosting, support, maintenance, and ongoing product management.<br />PEO EIS is currently exploring how to most effectively and efficiently provide this full range of capabilities to its customers in the near and long-term. This includes gaining a strong understanding of the market including potential providers, market segmentation, technology trends and dynamics, pertinent business trends, recent innovations, industry characteristics, best practices employed by both private and public sector organizations, and pricing structures. <br />PEO EIS understands that it needs support from its industry partners to help it meet its vision of being the "one-stop shop" for mobile applications within the Army. In the near-term, PEO EIS envisions acquiring the services identified in Table 1 below from a number of large and small business partners capable of developing applications across all mobile platforms including, but not limited to, iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, and Blackberry. This will help PEO EIS quickly meet the growing mobile applications demand and needs of its internal and external customers. <br />This RFI and the resulting responses are intended to enable the Army to design the optimal contract and acquisition strategy to achieve the stated goals.<br />Table 1: Preliminary Contract Scope<br />SERVICE CATEGORY SERVICE COMPONENT<br />1.0 Application Product Design 1.1 Market Strategy/Analysis<br />1.2 Requirements Development/Validation<br />1.3 Application Product Design<br />1.4 Architecture and Standards Development<br />1.5 Service Catalog Design and Alignment<br />2.0 Application Product Development 2.1 Development/Coding<br />2.2 Testing<br />3.0 Application Product Integration 3.1 Integration with Federal Civilian Systems<br />3.2 Integration with DoD Systems<br />3.3 Integration with Commercial Capabilities<br />3.4 Integration with Carrier Enablement Services<br />4.0 Security and Information Assurance (IA) Management 4.1 Certification and Accreditation (CON) Documentation<br />4.2 User Authentication<br />4.3 Device Authentication<br />4.4 Data Security<br />5.0 Middleware (Infrastructure) Management 5.1 Middleware Services<br />5.2 Process Management<br />6.0 Ongoing Application Product Management 6.1 Performance (SLA) Management<br />6.2 Schedule Management<br />6.3 Cost Management and Reporting<br />6.4 Earned Value Management<br />6.5 Risk Management /Contingency Planning<br />6.6 Business Continuity Planning<br />6.7 Procurement Management<br />6.8 Quality Management<br />6.9 Administrative Support<br />6.10 Regulatory Compliance Management<br />6.11 Third Party Relationship Management<br />7.0 Application Product Support 7.1 End User Tier 2/3 Support<br />8.0 Application Product Maintenance 8.1 Security (IAVA/STIG) Compliance<br />8.2 Patch Management<br />8.3 Update Management<br />9.0 Mobile And Wireless Services 9.1 Peripherals Management<br /><br />2.

<p>5. MARKET AND TECHNICAL QUESTIONNAIRE<br />1. In the near-term, PEO EIS intends on acquiring the services listed in Table 1 above through a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). <br />a. Are there any other critical services not mentioned in Table 1 that PEO EIS should consider? <br />b. Do vendors typically provide all of the services listed in Table 1 or is specialization in a specific set of services the more frequent model? PEO EIS anticipates multiple vendors (prime/subcontractor teaming arrangements ) providing services in combination to deliver mobile applications to the customer base. What are the potential issues PEO EIS may face when bringing these vendors together? What are the best practices that PEO EIS should consider to successfully integrate these multiple vendors across the mobile application lifecycle?<br />2. How is industry organized (segmented) to provide mobile application development and support services to its customers? By platform (Windows Mobile, Android, iPhone, etc.)? By service (development, design, support, etc.)? Other?<br />3. Do organizations seeking mobile device application development services typically award separate contracts (or perhaps, functional areas within a single contract) for each platform (Windows Mobile, Android, iPhone, etc.) or do they award a single contract that encompass all platforms? What are the advantages and disadvantages for each option?<br />4. PEO EIS would like to better understand industry practices with respect to how vendors demonstrate innovation and use of commercial best practices when designing, developing, integrating, and supporting mobile applications. Within the realm of mobile application services, how do vendors typically demonstrate innovation and use of commercial best practices? From a process perspective? From a service perspective? From a product perspective?<br />5. What are the emerging technology trends anticipated in the mobile application space that should be considered?<br />6. What commercial best practices and trends are typically considered when developing requirements for an acquisition focused on the services in Table 1?<br />7. What are the unique challenges that organizations such as PEO EIS face when developing mobile applications? What are the mitigating strategies?<br />8. PEO EIS would like to better understand how vendors can ensure success when designing, developing, integrating, and deploying mobile device applications. In what ways do vendors measure performance and success for each of the services listed in Table 1?<br />9. PEO EIS anticipates that its customers will require integration of their mobile applications with "back-end" Army, DoD, civilian, and commercial systems and databases. What are the key considerations and challenges in integrating mobile applications with back-end systems? How would you propose that these challenges be overcome? How can integration be streamlined? <br />10. What are the anticipated challenges vendors may face when trying to meet Army and DoD security requirements? PEO EIS intends to put all vendor-developed mobile applications through a stringent Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) process. What has industry's experience been in executing the documentation responsibility for C&amp;A efforts/packages with actual review and approval residing with the Government? What are the potential challenges that vendors may face when working with PEO EIS and the Army to coordinate and execute the C&amp;A process? How would you propose that these challenges be overcome?<br />11. What are the primary risks to data security at, and to/from, the device? What mitigation actions, either in the contract or in parallel, and considerations should be undertaken that will maximize PEO EIS' ability to ensure data security?<br />12. PEO EIS intends to manage its own application store in the near-term; however, it is also interested in understanding the best practices employed by commercial industry in developing and managing application stores. What are the commercial best practices in developing and managing application stores?<br />13. PEO EIS intends to host all provider-developed mobile applications in-house. What are the considerations and challenges associated with moving applications from the provider's development and testing environment to a secure PEO EIS hosting environment? How would you propose that these challenges be overcome?<br />14. PEO EIS intends to provide Tier 0/1 support for all provider-developed mobile applications through the Army Enterprise Service Desk (AESD) and expects providers to supply Tier 2/3 support. What role should providers play in helping maximize the performance of the AESD Tier 0/1 support? How can the interaction between the AESD and the provider be optimized? How should the provider-supplied Tier 2/3 support be integrated with the AESD Tier 0/1 support to ensure the most effective and efficient provisioning of application support?<br />15. What are the challenges and complexities associated with porting applications from one platform to another (e.g., Windows Mobile to iPhone; Android to Blackberry, etc)? How would you propose that these challenges be overcome? In what situations will porting applications be more difficult? Less difficult?<br />16. PEO EIS would like to better understand industry practices for deploying chargeback mechanisms to users of mobile device applications. How do organizations typically deploy chargeback mechanisms to users of mobile device applications? <br />17. PEO EIS has described its high-level vision for delivering mobile applications. Please provide your feedback on the stated vision and approach. In addition, please provide any other thoughts related to mobile application delivery that will aid PEO EIS in shaping its requirement.</p>

<p><br />Question # 1 - Home -style environment being that of an environment with various exposure such as: the canine live with a family, indoors, exposure to children, other species of animals, elderly persons, household furnishings, noises, daily exercise and socialization routine to include free exercise outdoors and structured exercise (walks/jogging with owner) and daily socialization in as many public areas as possible (familiar and unfamiliar surroundings, flooring, noises, strangers, ability to maneuver in tight and open areas, dark confined locations and comfortable with unfamiliar noises both in the household and in public arena's).</p>
<p><br />2. In section B.5 under "Delivery Order Minimum and Maximum Levels" it reads ATF could require from 1 to 100 dogs per month.</p>
<p>Q. Is there a more accurate number of dogs ATF would require from an individual vendor, and what would be the time line for delivery of requested dogs?</p>
<p><br />Question # 2 - An individual vendor (dependent upon the number of vendors available) could reasonably expect to provide 5-10 canines for ATF per year at the current ATF canine class schedule. The time frame for delivery of each canine could be as soon as 4 weeks. In other words and once again dependent upon the number of vendors, we may ask for one canine approximately every 6-8 weeks but the vendor would have at least a month to provide the canine.</p>
<p>3. In Description/Specifications, #3 it reads - "If a canine is purchased and later determined to be unacceptable the contractor will have the option to provide<br />a full refund to the government or provide an acceptable replacement canine while adhering to the predefined criteria."</p>
<p>Q. Is there a more definitive time line for deeming the dog unacceptable?</p>
<p>Question # 3 - Once the canine graduates from the ATF training program and begins working in the operational setting the vendor would no longer be required to provide a refund or replacement on the canine in question. From the date of acquisition until said canine becomes operational is the time frame that is in question for replacement or refund. Example - if the canine was acquired from the vendor on February 1st and the canine entered training on March 1st the canine if successful would be expected to graduate on July 1st (4 months later).</p>
<p>Canines are only returned if a medical or behavioral condition is discovered or surfaces during the training period in Front Royal. All medical issues will be reconfirmed with secondary medical consultations and behavioral issues will be evaluated to determine if the issue stemmed from a pre-existing event or a recent stress from training. Evaluations will be conducted by several sources prior to returning a canine.</p>
<p><br />4. Other than including the information in the Technical Proposal, is there a place on the contract that requires documentation of the number of canines we anticipate providing each year?</p>
<p>Question #4 -- No, but please realize that ATF is attempting to set up a Multiple award contract to provide different avenues in procuring canines. The very best scenario was provided by the program office: during the last twelve (12) years, only once did ATF hold nine (9) classes in one year and that was about six (6) years ago. If this occurred again during the next five (5) year contract period ATF would need eight (8) or nine (9) K-9's per class, eighty one (81) K-9's per year. "If" ATF awards ten (10) contracts; eight (8) K-9's from each contractor per year would be needed. Canines do get return if they don't meet ATF minimum requirement which would mean other contractors may be asked to provide even more canines for a class, if they are readily available.</p>

<DESC>This notice is modification #2 to the previously posted Sources Sought Synopsis(SSS) NNJ10ZBG001L.  The purpose of this modification is to expand the systems'stechnical requirements.   NASA/JSC is hereby requesting information about potential sources for a bi-directionalcommunications system between the International Space Stations (ISS) United StatesOn-Orbit Segment and Visiting Vehicles (VVs).  The ISS Common Communications for Visiting Vehicles (C2V2) system includes the following:	multiple antennas (without gimbals) that will be located externally on the ISS toprovide coverage for planned VV approaches for berthing or docking at designated dockingports;	low-noise amplifiers and associated electronics may be required on the ISS toensure adequate receive signal strength at radio location due to potentially long cableruns with associated losses between the antennas and the radios; and	two-way communications equipment including diplexers, combiners, radios, basebandsignal processors, Decryption/Encryption Devices (DEDs), and ISS and VV interfacehardware and software. The C2V2 system will reside on the ISS and the VVs.  The C2V2 system delivered to the VVswill not include the antennas or any associated antenna electronics or any ISS uniqueinterfaces; thus, ensuring the minimum equipment delivery to the VV to reduce VV size,weight, and complexity to the maximum extent possible.General technical requirements for the C2V2 system include:1.	S-band or Ultra High Frequency (UHF);2.	support approximately 10 kbps at a range of ~30 km and a minimum of ~74 kbps at~10 km with a bit error rate of 10-5 and a positive link margin; 3.	a spread spectrum radio;4.	conformance to National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)requirements for operation in low earth orbit; 5.	encryption/decryption of data in both directions;6.	processing for control of the C2V2 system, output of C2V2 health and status, andtransmission of the telemetry data;7.	for C2V2 equipment residing on the ISS, the following interfaces are required:		a 1553A/B interface to the ISS for critical data transfer and command and controlof the C2V2;	a separate control interface for sending time critical commands to unmanned VVsduring rendezvous and proximity operations;	Ethernet interfaces for hardline communications with up to four docked VVs andfor ISS non-critical data transfer; and	120 VDC power interface; 8.	for C2V2 equipment residing on the VV, the following interfaces are required: 	a RS-422 or other standard interface(s) to the VV for telemetry transfers,command and control of the C2V2 equipment residing on the VV, and C2V2 equipment healthand status output to the VV; and	28 VDC power interface;9.	a 15-year operating life for equipment residing on the ISS (VV operating liferequirements are less stringent);  10.	one fault tolerance; and11.	certified flight system delivery goal of July 2013 with functional equivalentunits delivered nine months earlier.The C2V2 system should be based on off-the-shelf hardware and software with provenperformance and reliability.  Innovative solutions that meet the fundamental need ofproviding reliable two-way communications at the required minimum bit rate, but that mayresult in some deviations to the aforementioned requirements, are encouraged and shouldbe brought forward for discussion.  Use of a modular architecture that allows for removalof the DED during the majority of ground testing and for separate delivery of the radioand DED to the VVs is highly desirable.  In addition to delivery of flight-certifiedhardware and software, functional equivalent hardware and software is also required forintegrated test in ISS and VV test facilities.The overall North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for thisprospective procurement is 336419 and the small business size standard is 1,000employees.No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.Information requested: Interested companies with the required, specialized capabilities to perform any aspectsof the effort described in this SSS should submit a capability statement indicating theirability to meet the specific requirements based upon their area of expertise. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business;average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether youare a large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned business;number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venturepartners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) orsubcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years(highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of eachprocurement; and point of contact - address and phone number), and a cost estimate forthis system. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-typeproduct.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as acommitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemedfully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  The Government reserves the right to consider an SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, 8(a),SDBVOSB, or HBCU/MI set-aside based on responses hereto. All firms will need to becertified at the time of proposal submission if this procurement takes place and is aset-aside.Any technical or procurement questions and all responses shall be submitted to KirbyCondron at kirby.l.condron@nasa.gov no later than 3:00 PM Central Time on October 19,2010.

<DESC>Naval Aviation Test &amp; Evaluation University (NATEU)<br />INDUSTRY DAY - 21 May 2010<br />Formal Questions and Responses<br />Solicitation N00421-10-R-1046
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>"Can you please advise as to whether there is an incumbent contractor for this requirement? If so, could you please provide the contractor name and the contract number that was awarded?"</p>
<p>Answer: There is not an incumbent contractor, therefore a contractor name and contract number is not applicable.</p>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<p>"Can you confirm whether this solicitation is still a SDVOSB set-aside, or is it now subject to full and open competition?"</p>
<p>Answer: Pending Small Business concurrence, this procurement will not be a small business set aside of any type. This procurement will be a full and open competition.</p>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<p>"When will the Industry Day brief be posted?"</p>
<p>Answer: The NATEU Industry Day brief was posted on 5/21/2010 on the FedBizOpps and NAVAIR websites.</p>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<p>"When will the Industry Day Questions and Answers be posted?"</p>
<p>Answer: The NATEU Industry Day Questions and Answers will be posted on or about 6/08/2010 on the FedBizOpps and NAVAIR websites.</p>
<p>Question 5:</p>
<p>"Would you consider teaming arrangements?"</p>
<p>Answer: Yes</p>
<p>Question 6:</p>
<p>A. "With so many facets leading you to your desired end state, why limit yourself to a single award contract - why not leverage the benefits of a MAC?"</p>
<p>Answer: It is a fundamental part of this contract to have continuity and an overarching strategic level management. It would be difficult to mange without a single line of accountability. We believe it is not in the Government's best interest even for cost purposes.</p>
<p>B. "Have you considered leveraging the training policies and processes in place at NETC?"</p>
<p>Answer: No, there are numerous DOD policies and instructions that will need to be pursued in multiple venues.</p>
<p>C. "Navy ILE is not yet mentioned, is/will any consideration be given?"</p>
<p>Answer: Unable to answer, not familiar with NAVY ILE.</p>
<p>D. "Have you considered AIM II/CPM's planned evolution as a training management system?"</p>
<p>Answer: Not specifically, it would be part of the strategy to come up with right system.</p>
<p>Question 7:</p>
<p>A. "Has thought been given to a Multiple Award Contract?"</p>
<p>Answer: It is a fundamental part of this contract to have continuity and an overarching strategic level management. It would be difficult to mange without a single line of accountability. We believe it is not in the Government's best interest even for cost purposes.</p>
<p>B. "What would be your misgivings?"</p>
<p>Answer: It is a fundamental part of this contract to have continuity and an overarching strategic level management. It would be difficult to mange without a single line of accountability. We believe it is not in the Government's best interest even for cost purposes.</p>
<p>Question 8:</p>
<p>"Since there are many technical experts spread over majority of companies in the area, have you considered an omnibus multiple award strategy?" If a single award, you may not be able to get to many folks that particularly could help with the training courses.</p>
<p>Answer: It is a fundamental part of this contract to have continuity and an overarching strategic level management. It would be difficult to mange without a single line of accountability. We believe it is not in the Government's best interest even for cost purposes.</p>
<p>Question 9:</p>
<p>"What does the incumbent contractor currently do with respect to the proposed tasking?"</p>
<p>Answer: There is not an incumbent for this requirement.</p>
<p>Question 10:</p>
<p>A. "Anticipated connection to DAU, PGS, etc?"</p>
<p>Answer: Collaboration with other required training venues for more effective instruction. Thus, building a T&amp;E training continuum and partnering for feedback with each other would be ideal.</p>
<p>B. "Anticipated partnership with NSN TPS and USAR TPS, etc?"</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, along with other vendors (i.e. University of Kansas).</p>
<p>C. "Anticipated connection to OPTEV FOR?"</p>
<p>Answer: Exchange program.</p>
<p>D. "Schoolhouse anticipated to be part of contract cost, outside Government facilities, all three sites?"<br />Answer: No MILCON, it is part of the contract to find training facilities at all sites.</p>
<p>E. "Number of courses during first year?"</p>
<p>Answer: To be determined. It will depend on finances, strategy, and bandwidth.</p>
<p>F. "Number of anticipated student body in first year?"</p>
<p>Answer: To be determined. It will depend on finances, strategy, and bandwidth.</p>
<p>G. "Industry (OEM &amp; CSS) allowed to attend these courses?"</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, that is part of the plan.</p>
<p>Question 11:</p>
<p>A. "What percentages do you see between education and training? Education being theories, concepts, and ways to think. Training being focused on skills; "how to do."</p>
<p>Answer: 50/50 or 60/40.</p>
<p>B. "What place do you see for distributed learning/on-line training?"</p>
<p>Answer: To be determined. Optimally, to strike a balance between in-class dynamics/dialogue (war stories) vice individual/independent learning.</p>

<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>B. "The briefing discussed KAS's that have already been determined for various domain specialties. Have formal training front-end analysis documents been developed (i.e. Instructional Performance Requirements Document, Instructional Media Requirements Document, etc)?"</p>

<p>C. "If the answer to the above question is no, is it expected/desired for the contractor to perform a comprehensive training FEA prior to the development of training products?"</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, in keeping with gap analysis.</p>
<p>Question 14:</p>
<p>"If the end result preferred is to have ABET accreditation, is there a University currently providing consultation on class curriculum &amp; proctoring?"</p>
<p>Answer: No, that is part of the intended strategy and what is expected from the contractor to determine.</p>
<p>Question 15:</p>

<DESC>Fabricate and install a new pump test stand.

This solicitation has been amended to change the acquisition set aside from a small business set aside to an unrestricted procurement.  The original solicitation was posted on 31 August 2010 and Amendment 0001 was posted on 7 September 2010 to add questions and answers from the initial site visit.

Amendment 0002 reopens the solicitation as unrestricted and communicates that a second site visit will be held on Tuesday, 26 October 2010 to view the existing pump test stand and the existing site conditions.  Amendment 0002 is posted along with a "conformed" version of the solicitation that incorporates the changes in both amendments. 

Any company interested in submitting a quote and technical proposal is strongly encouraged to attend the site visit.
  Comments from companies that attended the initial site visit indicated that this procurement is complex, as the new pump test stand must be interfaced with the existing steam drive and condensate infrastructure.  Companies are encouraged to develop partnerships and subcontracting relationships.

<DESC>Questions and Answers for RFI
<p>1. Will SEC provide access to real time trade data that can be used to store, aggregate, and manipulate to analyze equity order and transaction data?<br /><br />At this time the SEC is conducting market research and has not established our requirements. Do not assume we will provide real-time access to the data. The Commission staff is interested in viewing total solutions that can identify its source of the data and can process the data.</p>
<p>2. Will SEC consider responses that provide the capability to store, aggregate, and manipulate to analyze equity order and transaction data and be dependent on SEC to provide the source data? <br /><br />At this time the SEC is conducting market research and has not established our requirements. A solution should demonstrate these capabilities with the actual data that we are interested in viewing. The Commission staff is interested in viewing total solutions that can identify its source of the data and can process the data</p>
<p>3. There is no mention of providing a cost estimate; should we assume that this is not required for this RFI response? <br /><br />The RFI requested pricing information.</p>
<p>4. Will there be a vendor question and answers meeting via conference call or in person at your offices prior to the submission of the RFI response?<br /><br />We may meet with vendors via conference call or in person or may not, depending upon the responses.</p>
<p>5. What are next steps besides the submission of the RFI response?<br /><br />The RFI is a market research tool. There is no guarantee that we would proceed with a solicitation, but we could.</p>
<p>6. Can we contact you to speak with you at any point in the near future if needed?<br /><br />Yes.</p>
<p>7. The RFI does not stipulate a page count or method by which the SEC prefers delivery of a response.<br /><br />There is no page count but the SEC prefers the minimum number required to adequately respond. The delivery method preferred is electronic.</p>

<DESC>DLA Distribution (DLA J7-AB) has awarded a&nbsp;contract&nbsp;for software maintenance (technical support services) for program changes and systems development support required for the Computer Assisted Transportation Terminal (CATT) and associated interface software in operation at the Defense Distribution Kuwait South West Asia (DDKS) and the CENTCO theatre. The period of performance is from 01 October 2010 through 30 September 2011. <br />Software support cannot be determined or scheduled in advance; it is on an "on call" basis as needed, therefore, it is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a Labor-Hour Contract. The contract action is foran acquisition for which DLA Distribution New Cumberland, PA&nbsp;awarded directly to one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b) and FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The Government intends to award a Labor-Hour contract using FAR Part 13 to the sole service provider General Dynamics Information Technology, Incorporated.<br /><br />General Dynamics Information Technology, Incorporated is the only source that can provide service/support due to the proprietary nature of the systems and software which were developed by them for (CATT) used at DDKS and in the CENTCO theatre. The software in use has been declared proprietary; no other vendor could meet objectives, without gaining access to the "source listing code".<br />Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this support, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government.

<DESC><p>Recovery Action: Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE). This modification is issued to obligate American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 funds. These funds are made available for Project #20389 - Smart Grid Investment Program (EISA 1306). The funds will provide for technical expertise to the Smart Grid Investment grant program interoperability issues.</p>
<p>The Recovery Act Project title is Smart Grid Investment Grant Program (Project Code 2006000). The project code that should be used to track this Recovery Act funding in the Project section of the Accounting Flex Field in STARS/IDW is 2006000.</p>
<p><br />Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: The contract for the management and operation of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is a cost reimbursement type contract that lends itself to the research and development (R&amp;D) arena. The work described herein is for the purposes of research and development or for technical assistance in the review and evaluation of information. The contractor in the performance of work cannot easily and accurately predict the amount of effort or resources required to satisfy the customer requirements, particularly those unique to the Government, which usually results in a greater risk assumption by the Government. This is especially true for complex research and development contracts, when performance uncertainties or the likelihood of changes makes it difficult to estimate performance costs in advance, thereby eliminating the use of a fixed-price contract as a method of obtaining these services for the performance of work.</p>
<p>The original management and operating contract for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was competed and has been extended to its current completion date. The current contractor for the Management and Operation of PNNL is Battelle Memorial Institute. The Statement of Work (SOW) for the M&amp;O contract primarily addresses the conduct of basic and applied research and development (R&amp;D) to advance scientific knowledge, the nation's energy resources, national security and environmental quality and to strengthen educational foundations and national economic competitiveness. The work contained within this funding is in accordance with the statement of work and is consistent with the laboratory's mission. In addition, a majority of the funding received through the Recovery Act for the laboratory will be subcontracted and will provide for additional opportunities for a variety of businesses.</p>

<DESC>Recovery Action: Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR). This modification is issued to deobligate American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 funds. This research focuses on the development of advanced Kalman filtering techniques and the formulation of dynamic state estimation, which will fundamentally change the paradigm of real-time operations and control for complex systems. The proposed research may have a revolutionary impact on how complex systems are operated and ultimately lead to better decision making and control of complex systems.
<p>The Recovery Act Project title is Advanced Scientific Computing Research - Computational Partnerships SciDAC-e Program (Project Code 2005060). The project code that should be used to track this Recovery Act funding in the Project section of the Accounting Flex Field in STARS/IDW is 2005060.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION: This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars and is awarded under Contract No. HHSN261200800001E with SAIC-Frederick, Inc., the Operations and Technical Support contract for NCI-Frederick. The Contractor's DUNS number is 159990456.
<p>The purpose of this action is to fund the following ARRA project:</p>
<p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a large-scale, collaborative effort to characterize the genomic changes that occur in cancer.</p>
<p>Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Award: This award is priced as an "Other Than Fixed Price" action. Work assigned to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is pursuant to the terms and conditions of Contract No. HHSN261200800001E, a cost-plus-award-fee prime contract for operations and technical support to the NCI-Frederick. The use of a separate fixed price award to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is not appropriate because this is Research and Development work issued under an existing cost reimbursement contract.</p>
<p>Justification for Noncompetitive Award: This ARRA funded award is being made as a within scope modification to an existing contract awarded noncompetitively to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. pursuant to a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition signed by the DHHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy on January 17, 2007.</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>FA4809-10-M-R019
<DESC>LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
<p>I. CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION: The contracting organization responsible for this <br />action is the 4th Contracting Squadron, 1695 Wright Brothers Avenue, Seymour Johnson <br />AFB NC 27531.</p>
<p>II. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The action required is for the establishment of a Preventive Maintenance Agreement (PMA) for the external Aircraft Fuel Tank Conveyer System. This will consist of a Base Year and two (2) option years.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: To purchase annual routine maintenance for the external Aircraft Fuel Tank Conveyer System. <br /><br />IV. AUTHORITY: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation <br />Part 6.302-1.</p>
<p>V. APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award this requirement to only one source, International Automated Systems, Inc. The Aircraft Fuel Tank Conveyer System is a proprietary system. Necessary components and technical data are not available through any other source. This equipment takes up 1/3 the space and can store 285 more external fuel tanks than conventional horizontal tank stands and provides an organized method to centralize assets for annual inspection of each tank. The system has three lines capable of storing 100 tanks per line. The entire system runs from commercial power. During power failures, a backup generator is available. In the event commercial or generator malfunction, each line can be operated manually without electrical power. If a mechanical failure occurs on line, the other lines can be used if one line is down. The mission would be negatively impacted if the system could not be operated electrically and manually (structural or mechanical failure). International Automated Systems, Inc. would be dispatched and be on scene within 24 hours to repair the problem.</p>
<p>VI. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Not applicable since system is proprietary.</p>
<p>VII. FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: The Contracting Officer will make a price fair and reasonable determination following the procedures in FAR 13.016-3(a) (2).</p>
<p>VIII. MARKET SURVEY: N/A.</p>
<p>IX. OTHER FACTS: N/A.</p>
<p>X. INTERESTED SOURCES: There are no other known sources other than International <br />Automated Systems, Inc. as explained in paragraph 5. <br /><br />XI. STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION: Market research will be conducted to see what other systems exist when the Preventive Maintenance Agreement is due for recompetition. If there are other cost effective options at that time the Government will explore those alternatives.</p>
<p>XII. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION: The using activity has certified that the technical requirements and certifications are complete and accurate.</p>
<p><br />XIII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: The Contracting Officer's signature on the Justification Review Document represents certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p><br />1. CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION: The contracting organization responsible for this action is the <br />4th Contracting Squadron, 1695 Wright Brothers Avenue, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC 27531.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The contractual action is a brand name firm fixed price contract to purchase and install VERINT SYSTEMS INC.Channel Analog Telephone Card, model LDA2409 for the Audio Log MAX PRO Recording System already in place in the Emergency Communications Center. This card will replace the card currently installed, which is out of service which is causing the base 911 to become unserviceable. To fix the 911 outage the 4th Communications Squadron along with AT&amp;T had to bypass the voice recorder with the 911 phone lines. This however does not allow the 911 phones lines to be recorded which are a violation of National Fire Protection Association Code 1221 requirements IAW DODi 6055.6. Replacement of this card will enable the 911 phones lines to be recorded again.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES: To purchase, install and configure a VERINT SYSTEMS INC. 24-Channel Analog Telephony Card model LDA2409 for the Audio Log MAX PRO Recording System already in place in the Emergency Communications Center to record audio lines already in place.</p>
<p>4. AUTHORITY: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this <br />acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Audio Log MAX PRO Recording Systems is currently installed in the Co-Located Emergency Communications Center on Seymour Johnson AFB. The VERINT SYSTEMS INC. 24-Channel Analog Telephony Card model LDA2409 is the only card that will work in the voice recorder currently in use.</p>
<p>6. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: After speaking with Mercom, Carolina Voice Recording Systems and Voice Logging and Recorders and they stated that only VERNIT SYSTEMS INC. cards will operate in the Audiolog machines.</p>
<p>7. FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: Maintain the current voice recording system is far cheaper than replacing the entire system. Performing installation and upgrade of the system compared to replacing the system is a savings of about $60,000.</p>
<p>8. MARKET SURVEY: We attempted to ascertain whether other audio cards would work in the Audio Log MAX PRO Recording System but found none available because of the equipment needed to be recorded and the VERNIT SYSTEMS INC. voice card is the only one that will work in the Audio Log MAX PRO Recording Systems. We contacted Carolina Recording System, Mercom and Voice Logging and Recorders the three companies stated that the VERNIT card is the only one that will work in the Audio Log MAX PRO voice recorder and they had qualified personnel that could install the voice recording card and configure it to meet the needs of Seymour Johnson Fire Emergency Services.</p>
<p>9. OTHER FACTS: N/A</p>
<p>10. INTERESTED SOURCES: Carolina Recording Systems Inc.</p>
<p>11. STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION: A notice of the Government's intent to award a brand name contract was not publicized in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2 since the work has already been accomplished.</p>
<p>12. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION: The using activity has certified <br />that the technical requirements and certifications are complete and accurate.</p>
<p>13. CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: The Contracting Officer's signature on the <br />Justification Review Document represents certification that the justification is accurate and complete to <br />the best of his/her knowledge.</p>

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Contracting Agency: Department of Veterans Affairs, San Diego Regional Office 377.

2.	Nature and/or Description of Action: Notice of Other Than Full and Open competition for the procurement of Chapter 36 Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: Chapter 36 Education and Vocational Services having an estimated value of $273,900.

4.	Statutory Authority: The services are being procured under the authority of 38 U.S.C 8127(c), FAR 6.302-5 and VAAR 819.7007. 38 U.S.C. 8127(c) expressly authorizes the use of noncompetitive procedures for small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities (SDVOSB).

5.	Demonstration of contractor unique qualifications: The requested Chapter 36 Education and Vocational Services are to meet the immediate needs of returning veterans until a new national services contract can be procured. An SDVOSB with experience and acceptable performance from the prior national contract is best suited to meet the need based on having a current staff of approved counselors (both employees and subcontractors) that have met all the professional and background investigation checks required in performance of the contract.  Background investigations normally take 45 days to complete coupled with another 30 days for staffing leaves the regional office behind schedule in providing much-needed and timely services to veterans. 

6.	Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including notice publication:  See par. 4 and 5 above.  The proposed contract action will be synopsized at www.fbo.gov in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7.	Fair and reasonable price determination: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the Government based on using recent history of price for this type of service and comparison with the independent government estimate.  

8.	Market research: Market research was developed to support the independent government estimate. Data is also available from the recently completed national contract for the same services, which was competitively procured.

9.	Other facts: None.

10.	A listing of sources expressing an interest in writing: None

11.	Statement of action for barriers to competition: None.

12.	Contracting Officer certification: I hereby certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
