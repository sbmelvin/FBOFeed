Information can be found at www.ccr.gov<BR><BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.  Contractors shall adhere to the following process.  A list of foreign national employees shall be provided to the DPG Counterintelligence, Law Enforcement, and Security Offices at least five (5) working days prior to arrival on post.  A copy of  the list shall also be submitted to the Contracting Officer or an appointed Contracting Officers Representative (COR).  The list will contain name, nationality, green card "A" numbers or social security number, date of birth, drivers license number and state where issued.  The Contractor shall also list the date(s) foreign nationals will be on post.  If a sensitive test or visit is scheduled during the dates provided, the Counterintelligence Office will inform the Contractor whether the work/visit may take place.   Employees will not be allowed on Post until verification process is complete.  Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation:  Name, Company and Point-of-Contact.  The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit.<BR><BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground is located in a remote area.  The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah.  Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites.<BR><BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground operates on a four (4) day work week, Monday through Thursday, from 7:00 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. (local time) except for Federal Holidays.  Deliveries will be accepted on regular scheduled work days between 7:00 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. (local time).  The following Federal Holidays are observed: (a)	January 1st	(b)	3rd Monday in January	(c)	3rd Monday in February(d)	Last Monday in May(e)	July 4th 	(f)	1st Monday in September(g)	2nd Monday in October(h)	November 11th (i)	4th Thursday in November(j)	December 25th When any of the above holidays fall on a Sunday, the following Monday will be observed as the holiday; when a holiday falls on a Friday or Saturday the preceding Thursday is observed as the holiday.<BR><BR>(2)	The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing.  A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.  Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.
(3)	The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program.  Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice.  The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action.  In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start.  This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO.  Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.

(d)	An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. 
(e)	For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.  The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority.  
(f)	An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief.  All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest.
(g)	Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from (Eric Vokt US ARMY DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY DIRECTORATE OF CONTRACTING SFCA-NR-DW MS#1 5330 VALDEZ CIRCLE DUGWAY, UTAH 84022-5001).<BR><BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass.  This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks.  Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.
Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor.  It is the Contractors responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds.<BR><BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with.<BR><BR>ARMY CONTRACTING AGENCY EXECUTIVE LEVEL AGENCY PROTEST PROGRAM. (APR 2004)
(a)	This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103.  An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override.<BR><BR>ACRONYM (MEANING): FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation), DFARS (DoD FAR supplement), CLIN (Contract Line Item Number), SUB-CLIN or SLIN (Contract Subline Item Number), OSHA (Occupational Safety Health Act), FOB (Free-on-Board), PCO (Procuring Contracting Officer), CFR (Code of Federal Regulations), LSA (Labor Surplus Area), SF (Standard Form), DD/DOD (Department of Defense), NSP (Not Separately)Priced<BR><BR>The Federal Supply Class (FSC) is 6660.

Designed specifically for use with Nikon D1/D2-series and D100 digital SLR cameras, it features wideangle zoom capability, ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass and Nikon's exclusive built-in SWM (Silent Wave Motor). The lens is targeted at professional and advanced amateur Nikon D-SLR users who demand both the advantages of high optical performance and wideangle focal zoom range.This G-type Nikkor lens is designed with no aperture rings, and offers easier, virtually mistake-free operation because the aperture does not need to be set to minimum. Equivalent focal length in 35mm is 25.5-85.5mm. The Nikon Telephoto AF-S Nikkor 500mm f/4G ED VR LensThe Nikon Telephoto AF-S Nikkor 500mm f/4G ED VR Lens is a premium ultrafast telephoto lens for the Nikon autofocus system. It is a very robust and durable lens. Its lightweight construction incorporates a magnesium die-cast barrel, and professional-grade dust and moisture sealing allows it to be used in more rugged situations. This lens features the improved Vibration Reduction (VR II) system that allows handheld telephoto shooting, even in less-than-ideally lit conditions. The VR system minimizes image blur caused by camera shake, and offers the equivalent of shooting at a shutter speed of about 4 stops faster. In addition, this lens also features the Tripod Detection mode, which reduces vibration that may occur due to shutter release, when mounted on a tripod. The Silent Wave Motor (SWM) feature provides swift autofocus with superior accuracy and ultra-quiet operation. This G-type lens does not feature an aperture ring on the lens body, resulting in a lighter and more compact lens. Aperture changes are designed to be done via the camera's command dial. Note: VR function is only compatible with Nikon's F5, F100, N80, N65, D70, D100 & D1-series (or later generation) cameras.AF-S feature is not supported by certain older camera models. Please click here for a list of compatible models. "G" type lenses are not fully compatible with the F4, N90-series, N70, N8008-series and N6006 (or older model) cameras, only programmed auto or shutter-priority auto exposure mode can be used.FOB: DestinationMFR PART NR: 2147, 10, EA;<BR>LI 008, Nikon 500mm F4 AF-S Nikkor Lens - Filter Size 52mm or gelatin filters via rear drop-in slot f/Stop Range 4-22 Minimum Focus Distance 13.1' (4 m) Magnification 1:6.9 Angle of View 4 (35mm format)2 (Nikon DX format) Groups/Elements 11/14 Tripod Collar Yes Length 15.4" (39.1 cm) Maximum Diameter 5.5" (14.0 cm) Weight 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg) Usable Nikon Teleconverter TC-14E II (maintains autofocusing), or TC-20E II, TC-301 & TC-14b (manual focus only)FOB: DestinationMFR PART NR: 2172

It also is useful for mapping the margins of a skin lesion prior to and during surgical procedures.  The VivaScope 300 utilizes Lucid's patented StableView technology to ensure steady, motion-free images.    This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The resulting contract will be firm fixed price and the NAICS Code is 621512.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, Department of State infrastructure commonality, as well as IRM/EOCs operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has identified that Avocent KVMs are an integral component of IRMs Data Center Consolidation initiative. The equipment listed above is required to provide Keyboard, Video, and Mouse capability to users who wish to manage servers in remote department data centers. This equipment is also required because it is most compatible with the current VMware virtual machine infrastructure deployed at DOS.  The 41 USC 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the defined requirements as a key component of IRMs Data Center Consolidation initiative.   The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.

<DESC>The United States Congress designated the Tuxedni Wilderness in 1970 and it now has a total of 5,566 acres. In 1909, two islands at the mouth of Tuxedni Bay off of the western side of the Cook Inlet--Chisik and Duck--were established as a refuge for seabirds, bald eagles, and peregrine falcons. In 1970 they were designated Wilderness and in 1980 became a subunit of the Gulf of Alaska Unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Most of the refuge lies on Chisik Island (tiny, six-acre Duck Island is a rocky dot with almost no vegetation). Chisik slopes upward out of Cook Inlet from sandy beaches on the southern end to 400-foot cliffs on the northern end.
As the Tuxedni Wilderness is an extremely remote island with no development, and the IMPROVE sampler requires continuous power and that filters be changed every Tuesday of every week, year round, the IMPROVE monitoring is conducted at a nearby representative site that was established in 2001.  Both fine and course particulate monitoring under IMPROVE Progam representative for Tuxedni takes place at the Alaska Homestead Lodge that is located within Lake Clark National Park approximate 5 miles southwest from Chisik Island.  The exposed filters are mailed to the appropriate laboratory for analysis.  
James Isaak of the Alaska Homestead Lodge in being considered for award to be the operator of this site. He is one of very few year round residents within many miles of the wilderness area.  
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 5 calendar days  after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>3.  SCOPE:
A.	Better document  data collection methods at the Orchard Training Area
To date, methodologies on data collection methods for the OTA as summarized in Weaver (2006) has come in the form of emails and at meetings (methods summarized in USFWS 2006 and Foss 2006).  Product:  Documentation of these methods should be detailed in a single comprehensive review.  For example, information should be included on the number of surveyors, level of sampling effort, what days, effort comparisons between sampling years, etc.
B.	Statistically analyze data
The IDARNG data has not been statistically analyzed.  The wide fluctuations in Lepidium papilliferum numbers tend to be correlated with precipitation, therefore this statistical analysis should consider precipitation effects on abundance as described in other studies (Meyer et al. 2005, p. 15; Palazzo et al. 2005, p. 9; Menke and Kaye 2006a, p. 8; 2006b, pp. 10, 11).  
Products:  The statistical methods employed should be described, and highlight any difficulties encountered.  Statistical programming languages and outputs will need to be described and included as part of the final report.  In addition, OTA survey data from 2006, 2007, and 2008 will need to be obtained from the Idaho Army National Guard.
C.	Compare methods from the "rough census" to other survey efforts at the Orchard Training Area
The collection methods utilized in the "rough census" needs to be compared with other survey efforts at the Orchard Training Area.  For example, in 2005 URS Corporation documented significantly more occupied slickspots that had not been marked during "rough census efforts" and many more individuals than had been counted in similar areas during the same year.  Reports that should be reviewed include URS Corporation 2005a; 2005b; and TRS 2006 (see below).  
Products:  -  A map comparing survey areas should be developed that includes a comparative summary of the various methodologies. 	     -  An assessment of the comparative reliability of the various methods for determining population trend.
D.	Better illustrate habitat quality at the Orchard Training Area
Based on Element Occurrence (EO) rankings, Lepidium papilliferum habitat at the Orchard Training Area represents the highest quality habitat for the species on the Snake River Plain (Colket et al. 2006).  EO ranks need to be summarized Rangewide and, if possible, quantified to compare habitat quality to the Orchard Training Area.   
Products: The distribution of L. papilliferum at the OTA needs to be overlaid with habitat quality.  For example, areas with L. papilliferum, that have burned, or that are dominated by cheatgrass should be delineated and overlaid on a map.  The OTA may have a map already depicting this.
E.	Compare OTA data with HIP monitoring
Based on graphical representations, declines in numbers of Lepidium papilliferum individuals at the OTA, not consistent with precipitation, occurred starting in 1996.  The only data set available to assess the status of L. papilliferum range wide is the Habitat Integrity Index (HII) 1998-2002 (Mancuso and Moseley 1998, Mancuso et al. 1998; Mancuso 2000; 2001; 2002), followed by Habitat Integrity and Population (HIP) 2004-2008 (Colket 2005; 2006; Idaho Conservation Data Center 2007a; 2007b; 2008) monitoring.  And, this data set was initiated subsequent to the L. papilliferum declines at the OTA.  
Products:  -  A comparison of the OTA special use plots and rough census areas to the HII/HIP Rangewide monitoring is needed.  This comparison should include: 1) the HII/HIP data includes several transects at the OTA and the analysis needs to address how representative the HII/HIP data set from the OTA is in relation to range wide data, 2) a comparison of habitat quality across the range of the species (Colket et al. 2006) is needed that addresses OTA special use plots/rough census in comparison to HII/HIP, and 3) an analysis that attempts to correlate habitat quality with monitoring efforts, comparing the OTA to range wide data.
-  If possible, complete an assessment of the relative reliability of the two datasets for determining population trend.  How many years of HIP data would be needed to reliably estimate the range wide population trend?  What are the assumptions, and possible limitations, in extrapolating OTA data to range wide population trend?

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), a division of The National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to procure on a sole source basis high sensitivity cytokine analysis with Millipore Corporation- Bioscience Division, 28820 Single Oak Drive, Temecula, CA 92590.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification code is 541711 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Period of Performance: One year from the date of award.

The purpose of this procurement is to identify altered cytokine profiles in gastric cancer development and to assess the inflammatory determinants of H. pylori-related gastric cancer.  Specific Aims are to examine pre-diagnostic plasma levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-10 and IL12p70 in 151 gastric cancer cases and 310 controls nested within the Shanghai Women’s Health Study. 63 internal quality control duplicates will be included. Contractor shall use Luminex-based multiplexing technology for the simultaneous measurement of 6 cytokines in 100uL of plasma. The sensitivity of these assays have been validated in our pilot study. Elucidating the pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced gastric adenocarcinoma will contribute towards identifying potential non-invasive biomarkers of gastric cancer and can serve as a model for chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis in general.

The Milipore BioScience Service Laboratory is unique to perform the Luminex-based multiplexing technology for the simultaneous measurement of cytokines in plasma samples, because they are the only manufacturer of the Lincoplex kit used to perform the study.  The use of the Lincoplex kit in the cytokine profile study is beneficial because of low sample volume requirement and potential for many analytes per sample. The application of the Luminex-based cytokine assays to epidemiologic studies is necessary to contribute towards identifying potential biomarkers of gastric cancer. Milipore BioScience Service Laboratory is the only source known to the NCI that carries the Lincoplex kit and can perform the studies outlined in the procurement. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM ET September 9, 2008.  Faxed and E-mailed capability statements are not authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at Holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive and award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) is a large translational research program with goal design, development and delivery of innovative immunotherapies for various types of human cancers. Many projects involve monitoring patient immune responses pre and post-vaccination in the vaccine clinical trials. An ELISPOT assay for interferon gamma and other cytokines production to evaluate T-cell responses was used using peptides from tumor associated antigens such as CEA, PSA, MUC-1. These assays are also used in the pre-clinical study for many investigators in LTIB. An ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) Reader is required for the measurement of the number, the size, and the intensity of the cytokine producing specific T cells. The current ELISPOT Reader in LTIB is a first generation ELISPOT Reader. This ELISPOT Reader has limited functions and applications. In addition, the current ELISPOT reader gives diffused images and extra effort is required to distinguish the different between dirt from small spots in some samples. An advance model ELISPOT Reader is essential for the precise determination of patient immune responses pre vs. post vaccination.

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority 

1          Statute:  This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers   may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.  

Justification:  

The ImmunoSpot S5 Micro Analyzer is the most current advance model ELISPOT Reader. In addition, the ImmunoSpot S5 Micro Analyzer is manufactured by the same company (C.T.L) as our current older model of ELISPOT Reader. This ELISPOT Reader can support plate formats of 96-well, 48-well and 12-wells. In addition, it has high resolution and magnification (camera resolution = 2048 x 1536).

<CONTACT>Sally Boakye, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email boakyes@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure web monitoring internet audience measurement  services on a sole source basis from comScore Networks, Inc.  The NAICS code is 514191 and the period of performance shall be for a period of one year from date of award with four (4) additional option years.  This is a 100% small business set- aside. 

The Internet and World Wide Web (WWW or web) now play a dominant role in dissemination of NLM information services.  And the web environment in which NLM operates is rapidly changing and intensely competitive.  These two factors combined suggested the need for a more comprehensive and dynamic NLM web planning and evaluation process.  Accordingly, the NLM Director, Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg, and the NLM Associate Director for Health Information Programs Development, Dr. Elliot R. Siegel, have approved an ongoing Web Evaluation Project..  The immediate priorities of the Web Evaluation Project include: a) quantitative and qualitative metrics of web usage; b) measures of customer perception and use of NLM web sites; and c) monitoring of the quality of Internet connections by which users access NLM information services.  The Web Evaluation Project is pursuing an integrated approach intended to encourage exchange of information and learning within NLM, and help better inform NLM management decisionmaking on web site research, development, and implementation.  The Web Evaluation Project has reviewed and discussed a range of internal and external activities, including the proposed work that is the focus of this contract renewal request.



PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT:

	The contractor will support NLM in the above efforts.


SCOPE OF WORK:

The contractor shall provide NLM with Internet audience measurement services as follows:

1.  Basic Internet Audience Measurement Monthly Data.

The contractor will provide monthly data on US and international Internet audience estimates using domestic and international user panels that are of sufficient size to provide statistically valid (approx. +/- 3% at 90% confidence level) audience data for the US and non-US usage.

The contractor will have an established, verified Internet audience measurement methodology that will be explained in detail, in writing to NLM.
	
The contractor will provide US, non-US, and Global Internet audience measurement data on several metrics, including but not limited to:  unique visitors; total visits; total pages downloaded; average time per visit.  The data will be updated monthly.  The data will be provided for overall web traffic, national traffic, and select local market traffic for about 10,000 most heavily used Web sites, and demographic data for about 5,000 most heavily used Web sites.  US data will include Home, Work, and School sectors.

The contractor will have sufficient archived data to provide at least 3 years time series trends for US and non-US usage of major Web sites.  Ideally the contractor will have additional years time series trend data.

The contractor will provide NLM with at least 5 access codes for direct Web-based client access to Internet audience measurement data, and will provide persons designated by NLM with periodic updates on new data availability and special analyses.

2.  Select Health and Government Sector Monthly Audience Data.

The contractor will provide monthly reports on US, non-US, and Global Internet audience data for a total of 24 Web sites, 12 health sector Web sites and 12 Government sector Web sites to be selected by NLM.  The monthly reports will include data on the following metrics:  unique visitors; minutes; visits; pages; minutes per visit; visits per visitor; pages per visit; pages per visitor; minutes per visit; time series on select metrics.  US data will include Home, Work, and School sectors.

The monthly select sector reports will be provided electronically in Word or Excel format.

3.  NIH/NLM Detailed Subdomain Monthly Audience Data.

The contractor will provide monthly reports on US, non-US, and Global Internet audience data for all significant NIH/NLM subdomains, with the reporting structure of NIH and NLM Web sites to be mutually agreed to.  For the agreed subdomains (Web sites), the monthly reports will include data on the following metrics:  unique visitors; minutes; visits; pages; minutes per visit; visits per visitor; pages per visit; pages per visitor; minutes per visit; time series on select metrics.

 The monthly subdomain reports will be provided electronically in Word or Excel formats.

In FY00, NLM contracted with PCDataOnline, Inc. for Internet audience measurement services.  PCData was selected based on its high degree of flexibility, opportunity for custom surveys, and lower cost factor compared to the competition.  PCDataOnline provided useful data through February 2001, when the company went of business.  The Internet audience measurement accounts, including NLM's, were bought by comScore Networks, Inc.  comScore Networks honored the PCDataOnline contract by providing netScore data for the duration of the contract.  Additionally, comScore took steps to reconcile the netScore data with the PCDataOnline data to assure a complete and continuous time series.  From 2002 thru 2005, ComScore Networks provided the Internet audience measurement service with custom subdomain drill-downs.  In FY04, comScore bought certain assets of MediaMetrix, and now provides consolidated services that incorporate the services previously provided by comScore.

In FY08, NLM staff again has reviewed the marketplace for providers of Internet measurement services.  NLM staff conducted searches of the web and consumer health information sites, and made inquiries of persons and organizations familiar with this market.  NLM staff determined that comScore Networks Inc. was the only vendor able to maintain continuity with the earlier PCData and netScore time series data, offer the necessary flexibility in meeting NLM's needs for custom analyses and drill down data, and provide by far the most complete coverage of the domestic (home, school, work) and international user segments based on the largest panel size and thus offering a basis for more comprehensive and accurate usage estimates. 

This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced service as specified above.

These contracts provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT).  This sole source is to prevent a lapse in service for roughly a six month period (estimated July, 26 2008 through January 25, 2009) during negotiation and award of multiple contracts under RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 for Patent Legal Services which was posted to www.fbo.gov on March 2, 2007.  This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 as it is impracticable to seek competition for the roughly six month period while negotiations under RFP #263-2006-P(GM)-0247 are ongoing.  Only the current contractors are uniquely qualified  to perform the services required within the six month period.  Based on the complexity and level of detail involved in dealing with these cases, it is not feasible for new contractors to assume responsibility for the patent case load for such a brief period of time and meet the deadlines necessary for filing with the USPTO and foreign entities. The OTT active patent prosecution docket is in excess of 1,300 cases and the OTT issues thousands of task orders for these cases that are in various stages of the patent application process or prosecution.  The transfer of cases to new vendors will take a minimum of one month and then, in all likelihood, will have to be transferred just a few weeks after to new contractors receiving awards under RFP 263-2006-P(GM)-0247. For example, the transfer of files could take between six weeks to three months, providing a new bridge acquisition vendor only a few weeks to handle work before transferring cases to the awardees under RFP 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 if the second transfer of files is less than three months.  Between the time for transfer of cases, the vendors would not be able to go through the conflict of interest process, proceed with the docketing procedures in an efficient manner to determine the prosecution stage, get up to speed on billing procedures, inventors and new technology as well as review the entire family of applications and determine which of the key personnel in the firm is best to handle the work.  This process is time consuming and must take place before actual work can begin.  RFP 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 has an orientation required on site at OTT for all awardees.  It is not possible for the government to provide an extensive orientation for new vendors during this bridge acquisition period. Interruption of service would result in significant harm to the U.S. Government in the loss of intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign countries in connection with multiple patent cases.  This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements of the Statement of Work and the terms and conditions of the current bridge contracts. Capability statements and related materials must be received by the Contract Specialist no later than July 21, 2008, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time. Written responses received after July 21, 2008, 10:00 AM Eastern Time will not be accepted. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Address responses to the attention of Erin Flynn at the National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions via email at flynne1@od.nih.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A Request for Information (RFI) NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.  THIS RFI IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. The Naval Systems Engineering Directorate (SEA 05) of the Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is seeking information from vendors with experience in applying systems and component specifications and standards used in Navy shipbuilding and weapons and combat system acquisition programs to assist SEA 05 in identifying significant cost drivers associated with these programs and to recommend steps toward reducing the cost associated with the use of these specifications and standards in building a more affordable future fleet.  This assessment should concentrate on the impact these requirements have on design, manufacturing, testing, and inspection costs.  In assessing the cost impact of the specifications and standards when making a cost/benefit comparison, sources are encouraged to consider the unique needs of warships and of the combat and weapons control systems which they carry.  Your recommendations will have greater impact during the evaluation phase of this study if they clearly consider the world-wide operating environment of the U.S. Navy and the additional man-made environments (weapons effects) to which a warship and its systems are exposed when the ship is fulfilling its design purpose (i.e., surviving and overcoming the enemy in combat).  The list of applicable specifications and standards subject to this request for information is provided below.  Copies of these specifications and standards may be obtained from the ASSIST Website or by requesting a copy from the Government point of contact provided.  ASSIST is the official database containing information about standardization documents used in DoD. Assist is located online at http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch (no password required) or http://assist.daps.dla.mil (password required).

Respondents must be a System Integrator and/or Original Equipment Manufacturer using any or all of the specifications and standards listed above in the development, production, and sustainment of its products and have proven experience to support the cost and benefit comparison provided by the respondent with regard to:
1) Specification/Standard Content, Application, and Interpretation 
a)	Specification/Standard Content:  The technical requirements associated with specifications and standards stated above are accurate and the costs associated with meeting specifications and standards requirements far exceed the differential benefit received through compliance.b)	Specification/Standard Application/Invocation: The content is reasonable, but not appropriate for non-critical applications and thus differing applications could reduce costs. i.e.,	What are the criteria of "non-critical" systems that the Specification/Standard should not apply to and what requirements of the Specification/Standard can be waived?c)	Specification/Standard Interpretation: Content and Application may be appropriate, but interpretation/enforcement practices add unnecessary costs. i.e.,	What standardization of the test criteria for each Specification/Standard is required to eliminate the contention of whether a system is meeting the requirements?	Does the Specification/Standard provide clear instruction on how each test is performed?	Is the Specification or Standard invoked in a consistent and appropriately tailored form in the procurement documentation (Statement of Work, Ship Specification, and/or Weapons Specification)?
d)	General assessment of costs drivers (i.e., labor, materials, administration, etc) 
(2) Identification of potential alternatives (such as the use of commercial specifications or standards) for each of the targeted specifications and standards:
a)	Equivalent commercial standards and specifications addressing the same issues for the requirements of interest.b)	Where applicable, the interrelationship among the commercial specifications and standards and Military Specifications and Standards.c)	The criteria that the commercial specifications and standards must meet so that the Military Standard could be replaced.
(3) Recommended steps to validate and implement lower cost alternatives 
(4) For Shipyard processes, please address the following:
a)	Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on redesign.b)	Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on installation costs.c)	Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on testing costs.d)	Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on other costs.
Interested sources are requested to provide UNCLASSIFIED documentation describing the potential cost savings which could reasonably be attributed to the modification of the Specification/Standard described by the respondent or resulting from the improved tailoring of the application of the Specification/Standard.  This documentation should not exceed 30 pages in length. After government personnel have evaluated the respondents submissions, the government may elect to have its personnel contact a subset of the respondents to obtain additional information regarding the information provided by the respondent with respect to this request for information on the same terms as set forth below for this request for information.
RESPONSES SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:  Company name; Address; Point of Contact; Phone Number; and E-mail address.  All information submitted in response to this synopsis shall be received not later than 30 days following issuance of this RFI. All submissions must be made electronically, and be in one of the following formats: Adobe PDF, or Microsoft Word and must be submitted to Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division 5001 South Broad Street, Building 4, Philadelphia, PA 19112, Attn:  Doris Tung or emailed directly to doris.tung@navy.mil. Telephonic responses are not acceptable.  The Government may not respond to any specific questions or comments submitted in response to this request for information.  Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this request for information is strictly voluntary.  This request for information is for information gathering and planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this request for information.  This request for information is a market research tool being used to expand the governments knowledge of potential cost savings associated with the construction, testing, deployment, and sustainment of Naval vessels and the systems which they carry.

Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.  September 2009 is the estimated award date of the resultant long-term requirements contract.  The following are the top 5 high dollar value items for repair. The estimated quantities are for each year: RECEIVER-TRANSMITTER, NSN 7R-5821-01-528-7375, P/N VA-018150, est. 50 ea;  RECEIVER-TRANSMITTER, NSN 7R-5821-01-484-2791, P/N VA-018150-XX, est.50 ea; PROCESSOR, NSN 7R-5998-01-528-7004, P/N VA-016390, est. 25 ea; PROCESSOR, NSN 7R-5998-01-528-7010, P/N VA-016380, est. 25 ea; PROCESSOR, NSN 7R-5998-01-483-9739, P/N VA-016380, 25  ea.  For a complete list of all items to be repaired or any questions concerning this notice, contact S. STEIN 215-697-6511.
The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP-P at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a noncompetitive contract using procedures authorized by FAR Part 6 for an IBIS Ballistic Imaging System, consisting of a IBIS-Trax 3D system (comprised of Bullet Trax, Brass Trax, and MatchPoint Analysis workstations, data concentrator, conversion of IBIS Heritage DAS to IBIS Heritage RDAS, and related installation, training, and warranty), from Forensic Technology, to be donated for use by the government of Mexico under the Department's international narcotics and law enforcement program. 

This notice is not a request for proposals; this acquisition will be processed using the authority in FAR 6.302-1.  Justification for other than full and open competition is that the Government requires an integrated ballistics identification system to prosecute and convict criminal elements in Mexico and only the equipment noted above will suffice. The Government has researched this technology and was unable to find any other companies able to meet the requirements. The required equipment must be compatible and able to interface with the existing IBIS systems in Mexico, at the federal and state levels, as well as IBIS systems in U.S. law enforcement agencies involved in for weapon investigation and prosecution. Only the items listed above meet these needs.

Solicitation is not available at this time. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to change the acquisition strategy.

<DESC>The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L, LCMC)Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for The Rapid Response (R2) Acquisition Thrust. The R2 is the major part of a Command Pilot Program to increase the Armament, Research, Development and Engineering (ARDEC) responsiveness to meeting its customers immediate requirements. In support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT), ARDECs mission, including lethality and counter-lethality efforts has expanded to include providing expedited developmental solutions to meet the customers needs at various stages of the lifecycle of a product. Historically, research and development was allowed years to develop and integrate solutions into weapons systems. Todays reality requires ARDEC to provide working lethality and counter-lethality solutions as quickly as possible. In many instances, solutions need to be provided within weeks from receiving a requirement or no more than one year.
This R2 effort will provide a responsive contracting vehicle to meet these surge and/or specialized requirements. The use of a broad scope Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with multiple prime contractor awards to maintain competition is expected to provide the flexibility and responsiveness required to meet current Army mission requirements.
This competitive acquisition is intended for multiple award contracts as a result of the Request for Proposal (RFP) (W15QKN-08-R-8403). An integrated assessment will be made by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) from the results of the evaluation factors and sub-factors as set forth in Section M. Multiple awards will be made based on the best overall proposals that represent the best value to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the Offerors Technical, Management, Task Order 1 and Delivery Order 1, Past Performance, Small Disadvantaged Business Participation and Price/Cost. Pre-award surveys may be conducted. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest price offeror or to other than the offeror with the highest color rating if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.
After contract award, individual Task/Delivery Orders will be competed amongst the multiple awardees under each respective contract utilizing fair opportunity procedures in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1). The Government will put forth a Letter of Contemplation and the Contractors will have five working days to respond. Proposals will be evaluated using an integrated assessment of schedule, cost and performance. The Government will evaluate the responses over a period of seven working days and then a period of five working days will be used to negotiate between the Government and the contractor (as required) and then award the task (seventeen working days in total is the goal for Task/Delivery Order award).
A non-disclosure agreement will be required to be signed by the offeror(s) receiving an award. The Government intends to award this contract on a best value basis using Full and Open Competition. It is anticipated that the IDIQ will have duration of five years. 
It is anticipated this solicitation will be posted on the US Army JM&L, LCMC Procurement Network website located at http://procnet.pica.army.mil. This is not an RFP; the RFP will be issued on or about July 14, 2008. The deadline for all proposals will be 45 days after issuance of the RFP.
Questions shall be submitted to U.S. Army JM&L, LCMC, Attn: Margaret B. Reed, Contract Specialist, AMSML-AQ-SP, Building 322, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, Email: margaret.b.reed@us.army.mil.

This service shall be completed by 5 September 2008.<BR><BR>The unit public affairs (PA) mission is essential to the overall mission of AWG. This PA mission is both continuous and multi-faceted. One of the most important facets is a marked presence at military symposia and similar events.

The cabinets must be flush-mounted on wall surfaces securely to prevent falling off wall if bumped by moving equipment.  The exterior dimensions must be no more and no less than 6" deep to meet OSHA requirements and is approximately 17" (+ or - ") W and approximately 24" (+ or - ") H.  The cabinets must also have a two color-flagging system visible from a distance to notify staff of delivery of medications and discontinued medications ready for pick-up.  The cabinets must have a keyless and keyed entry for ease of access with a backup access for contingency.  Multiple cabinets are to be keyed the same, to be specified by the requesting service and at least two (2) keys are to be provided per cabinet.  Keyed cylinders must be easily replaceable by VA engineering staff if security is breached.  Keyless lock assemblies must be well-constructed with quality parts and are to be covered by the warranty.  The door to the cabinet must have a security lip to guard against lock tampering, must open down to provide a sturdy work surface, have a sturdy pneumatic door opening cylinder to prevent the door from dropping open and have a strong piano-type hinge to distribute the weight of the door.  At least 2 service and 2 operator manuals for each device that is ordered must be provided.  Warranty must be at least 5 years with the possibility to extend.  Company will provide Biomedical/Engineering training on site for maintenance and repair and provide drop-ship service on repair parts when the company is notified of part failure.  Replacement parts are to be easily replaced by VA Biomedical/Engineering staff.  Cabinets are to be installed by vendor with any necessary hardware, in designated locations by the specified time by contracting office.  Internal shelves are to be at least 14" L X 4" W.  The interior of the cabinets are to be constructed of sturdy scratch resistant metal that is cleanable with hospital disinfectants.  Cabinets are to have four (4) interior shelves each that are vertically adjustable in 1/2" increments.  Four (4)  removable interior shelf bins are to be supplied with each cabinet that are 12" L X 4 " W X 3" H with an attached tethered cord approximately 22" long that the other end attaches to the interior of the cabinet to prevent the bins from being taken away from the cabinets and being misplaced.  Cords must allow the bins to be moved from the shelves and placed onto the open door surface of the cabinet for visibility of contents and then returned to the shelves.  Due to the size, design, and material requirements of these cabinets, the VA believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements and intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation packages are not available. The Contracting Officer will make the determination whether to compete this proposed action based on responses received to this notice.  All responses received must demonstrate the full capabilities of their product.  Qualified parties must submit their information in writing to the VA Medical Center, Contracting Officer (NBC), Attn: Alex Daniel, 4100 West Third Street, Dayton OH by September 5, 2008, 11:00 AM, EST.

<CONTACT>Kevin R Woody, Contracting Officer, Fax 202-208-0987, Email kevin.woody@ferc.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought posting for market research purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC is seeking vendors capable of providing the below requirement:  
Scope of Work

The contractor will examine the design, operation, and maintenance of proposed or existing LNG facilities and provide suggestions and/or recommendations for enhancing their safety, reliability, and design based on professional experience, good engineering practices, federal regulations, industry standards, FERC guidance documents, historical or recent industrial accidents and incidents, and problems uncovered during FERC staff inspections.  

The FERC has interstate LNG peak-shaving and storage facilities, and base-load import and export terminals under its jurisdiction.  The contractor will examine all of the equipment, piping, and vessels, including related systems within the plant.  Elements of these facilities subject to review are the cryogenic components and related systems including, but not limited to: the LNG storage tanks and refrigerant storage tanks/vessels; trucking; marine docks and unloading arms; pretreatment, liquefaction, vapor handling, and metering systems; transfer lines; compressors; pumps; vaporizers; Btu reduction by natural gas liquids stripping or blending systems; instrument and pneumatic control systems; firewater systems; hazard detection and control systems; spill containment; and all associated equipment/processes.  The reviews also cover the operation, maintenance, management of change, and emergency procedural philosophies of each facility.
  
FERC staff will obtain and provide the contractor with the necessary initial background and technical material including facility specifications and design details appropriate to the individual projects.  This information shall serve as a basis for each review.  FERC staff will be responsible for scheduling/coordinating all work with the LNG facility applicant/owner.

FERC staff will accompany the contractor during technical conferences, site inspections, and site meetings.  The contractor will be responsible for conducting these technical conferences with the applicant/plant operators and for implementing site inspections.  Based upon the technical conferences, site inspections, and related studies, the contractor will submit reports and findings to FERC staff.  Reports and findings include a written technical evaluation, recommendations, conclusions, and a Manual for each technical conference/site inspection.  This contract does not include thermal and vapor exclusion zone, structural, or seismic design reviews of a facility.

Pre-Filing (PF) Review

For new facilities, information is filed under the PF docket number and FERC staff will provide the contractor with one copy of this filing.  The contractor shall use eLibrary to obtain copies of minor  applicant submittals or FERC issuances after the initial application filing.

The contractor, using the applicant’s engineering information filed in the draft Resource Report 13 under the PF docket number, will conduct an initial design screening.  This initial design screening will determine if the level of information provided is adequate for the cryogenic reviews which will be conducted later under the CP docket number.  This design screening does not entail a detailed review of the proposal, but should examine the filed information for any significant design flaws which should be addressed prior to the filing of a CP application.

If an initial design screening results in a finding that the design or filed information is significantly deficient, incomplete, and/or requires major modification, the contractor shall notify the FERC staff and the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) by email and identify the major design or filing deficiencies.  
 
A PF review should typically be completed within about 1 month of receipt of the project information from the FERC staff, and should take a contractor 1 to 3 days to complete depending upon the experience, skill, and expertise of the reviewer.  A Manual is not a deliverable for this work item.  Actual timetables/schedules will be determined by the appropriate LNG Branch Chief and may be adjusted as necessary to resolve unexpected issues.

When the contractor has completed the review of a facility and decides that he/she no longer wants to retain the information for future use, the contractor shall either shred or burn all propriety information, or return it to the COTR for disposal.


New Facility Review

For new facilities, the engineering information is filed under a CP docket number.  FERC staff will provide the contractor with one copy of this filing.  The contractor shall use eLibrary to obtain copies of minor applicant submittals or FERC issuances after the initial application filing.

The contractor, using the information filed under the CP docket number including Resource Reports 1, 11, and 13, will review the design of a new or significantly expanded LNG facility and prepare an engineering data request.  The data request shall identify issues or concerns related to the design, operability, reliability, and maintenance of the proposed facilities, including interaction with any existing facilities.  Data request questions should typically be emailed to FERC staff within 30 days after receipt of the application from FERC staff.

A technical conference will occur approximately 3 months after an applicant has filed an application under a CP docket number. Excluding travel time, the contractor and FERC staff will typically require 2 days in the project area to conduct a field inspection of the new or expanded site and to hold a technical conference to obtain clarifications and discuss design issues with the applicant.  After the technical conference and receipt of any additional information filed in response to the questions discussed at the technical conference, the contractor will prepare a camera ready  Manual, including a set of the Piping and Instrumentation Drawings (P&IDs) and other drawings that were used for the design review.  The P&IDs and other drawings shall be black ink on white paper and shall be 8.5-inches wide by 11-inches long.  The Manual shall include all amendments and supplemental information filed by an applicant up to the date of the technical conference and all company/contractor verbal and follow-up written responses to the issues raised during the site visit and technical conference.

Once the technical conference has been completed and supplemental information has been filed, final recommendations for the proposed design shall be emailed to FERC staff as soon as possible.  The contractor shall also include a brief explanation after each recommendation to discuss why it is needed and what the company will likely need to do to satisfy each recommendation.  A New Facility Review will typically be completed within about 3 months after the CP application is given to the contractor.  Actual timetables/schedules will be determined by the appropriate LNG Branch Chief and may be adjusted as necessary to resolve unexpected issues.

When the contractor has completed the review of a facility and decides that he/she no longer wants to retain the information for future use, the contractor shall either shred or burn all propriety information, or return it to the COTR for disposal.

Partial Project Review

A facility evaluation under the Partial Project Review process shall use the same types of information and timeline that is used for a New Facility Review unless the COTR or appropriate LNG Branch Chief identifies the need for an adjusted time line.  Any changes in the timing requirements that seek a shortened schedule shall be identified by FERC staff prior to the contractor providing, in writing, the proposed cost for the Partial Project Review.  An email may be used to transmit this information to the contractor.

This work item establishes a process for the FERC to obtain from the contractor a review of limited aspects of an LNG facility for a fixed fee which is negotiated and established before work commences on the work item.  The contractor will examine the information provided for the project, and provide FERC staff with a proposed fixed fee for completing the cryogenic review of the project.  FERC staff will review the proposal and, if accepted, the COTR will issue a Work Order to authorize the Partial Project Review.  The fee for a Partial Project Review will be less than the fee for a New Facility Review.

The Partial Project Review option can be used by the FERC when an applicant seeks to modify or install one or more additional systems at an existing facility, e.g., a natural gas liquids stripping system and/or supplemental “ambient air” vaporizers.

The contractor will thoroughly examine all aspects of the safety and reliability of the design for the proposed new systems, including a review of how they interact with the other existing plant systems.  The level of review required for completion of the deliverables under this review option is the same as that used for a New Facility Review except it focuses only on the new systems and their impact on the existing systems, if any.  The contractor will prepare updated pages for all sections of the Manual by incorporating the new facilities/systems. 

When the contractor has completed the review of a facility and decides that he/she no longer wants to retain the information for future use, the contractor shall either shred or burn all propriety information, or return it to the COTR for disposal.

Existing Facility Inspection

The contractor will prepare for and conduct with FERC staff a site inspection of an existing LNG plant using P&IDs, engineering drawings, semi-annual operational reports since the last inspection, and other information that has been filed or received by staff during this time period, e.g., in response to data requests, and the mostly recently prepared Manual.  The FERC staff will send the contractor copies of the semi-annual operational reports, and electronically provide the contractor with a copy of the last Manual prepared for an existing facility.

The site inspection usually entails a visual inspection of all areas in the plant, review of selected operations and/or maintenance procedures and records, and discussion of operating problems or other issues that have affected plant operations since the last inspection.  The contractor will prepare an updated Manual for the facility that discusses the findings of the inspection and documents how any recommendations made at the last inspection were resolved.  The contractor shall also update the Manual as needed to correct any problems with its content that are found during the course of the facility review/inspection.  The contractor and FERC staff will brief plant personnel with their findings prior to concluding the site inspection.  The contractor will provide FERC staff with a final version of the recommendations within 10 days after the conclusion of the site visit.  The contractor shall complete the Manual for a biennial/annual inspection within 2 months after the site visit unless the time limit is waived in writing by the COTR or appropriate LNG Branch Chief.  This Manual shall also include the Inspection Forms that were completed during the site inspection.   

LNG facility inspection schedules will be arranged with either the COTR or the appropriate LNG Branch Chief.

When the contractor has completed the review of a facility and decides that he/she no longer wants to retain the information for future use, the contractor shall either shred or burn all propriety information, or return it to the COTR for disposal.

Requirements

The contractor must have an education in a relevant engineering field, e.g., chemical, mechanical, civil, or fire protection engineering.  The contractor must have sufficient technical expertise and experience to recognize when a design is fatally flawed and will need extensive modifications to make it acceptable/workable.

Emphasis will be placed on the design, operability, and reliability of the facilities, including their possible interactions with the surrounding areas (e.g., piping class, other industrial facilities in the area) around the facility.  The impact of engineering design, such as appropriate use of existing technology and materials selection (e.g., carbon versus stainless steel), will be assessed.  The basis of review will include various codes and standards, prior experience, precedents, and engineering knowledge.  Personnel qualifications must demonstrate at least 15 years of design, operations, maintenance, safety, and/or fire protection engineering experience at industrial facilities or engineering firms with particular emphasis on processes involving hydrocarbon or cryogenic fluids (liquid oxygen, nitrogen, LNG).  Experience from inspecting industrial facilities and working as an engineering design and procurement contractor can also be used to demonstrate relevant work experience.  Prior work experience associated with LNG facilities or other cryogenic fluids is more heavily valued and preferred over experience in other industrial facilities that do not involve the construction, operation, and maintenance of processes that handle fluids.  

Deliverable Items

Based upon the studies, conferences, and/or inspections, the contractor will submit reports to FERC staff setting forth the technical evaluations, recommendations, data request questions, and conclusions for each project as indicated within the Scope of Work.  The contractor will attend technical conferences for new and expanded facilities and participate in discussions with plant personnel during on-site inspections of operating plants.   The contractor shall also complete and provide to FERC staff a Manual for each New Facility Review, Existing Facility Review, and Partial Project Review, including a Summary Assessment.  The Summary Assessment will include the contractor’s major findings of the project review or inspection and recommendations.  For an existing facility the Summary Assessment will also discuss the status of the last inspection’s recommendations, if any.  The inspection of existing facilities also requires the completion of Inspection Forms which shall be included in the Manual.  One camera-ready Manual is required.  The contractor shall also provide one electronic copy of the report and the manual on a compact disk in Word 2002 and/or Excel 2003.   FERC staff will provide the contractor with either the latest Manual for an existing facility, or a “blank” manual for a new facility, including any Inspection Forms that have been previously used for a facility. 

All work products under this contract may be initially submitted electronically to the FERC staff using files attached to emails, with a copy to the COTR.  One hardcopy, with a CD, shall be mailed to the COTR.

<SOLNBR>GUARDIAN
<CONTACT>Shannon C. Malisani, Contracts Specialist, Phone 5093756814, Email shannon.malisani@pnl.gov
<DESC><p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle), operator of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public and private), or other sources about commercially or government available equipment, or near-commercial technologies that may be used for the detection of radioactive materials and/or special nuclear materials at Department of Defense (DoD) installations.
<p>This request for information (RFI) is part of an overall strategy to identify the next generation of radiological interdiction equipment for fielding as soon as next fiscal year, which begins October 1, 2008. The information obtained by this RFI will be included in a market survey that will be coupled with a test campaign to determine what system or systems should be recommended to the client for fielding. The phasing of this strategy may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Sources sought announcement<br />&bull; Market study and preliminary testing (PNNL may test systems upon request of the vendors)<br />&bull; Ranking and formal testing (top 2-5 systems based on ranking criteria may be tested by PNNL)<br />&bull; Recommendation (top 1-3 systems) that may include one or more of the following:<br />&nbsp; o Spectroscopic<br />&nbsp; o Non-spectroscopic<br />&nbsp; o Portable system<br />&bull; Procurement action<br />&bull; Acceptance testing<br />&bull; Prototype fielding<br />&bull; Unrestricted fielding<br />&bull; Lifecycle maintenance and improvements</p>
<p>Interested organizations/companies/institutions may propose to have their equipment tested at PNNL or provide PNNL with the results of a screening test procedure as part of the aforementioned market survey. The screening procedure will be provided upon request. NOTE: equipment provided to PNNL for testing must be &lsquo;cord and plug' and should be National Recognized Testing Laboratory (e.g. Underwriters Laboratory) listed.</p>
<p>PNNL is interested in information on systems that would be usable for improved sensing of radioactive materials in commercial vehicles of all sizes and shapes, and personal vehicles of all sizes and shapes. Both high volume screening instruments, and detailed inspection instruments are of interest. Specifically, PNNL is looking for information regarding the expected technical capability and effectiveness of currently (or soon to be) available instrumentation with respect to expected threats given the speed, distance, shielding, etc. conditions that are typically found at vehicle crossings. Operational issues, specifically detection probabilities and false alarm probabilities for typical measurement conditions are of particular interest. Other issues that might impact operations, such as required facility modifications, reliability and robustness, training requirements (must not require extensive user training), and health and safety issues are also of interest.</p>
<p>Interest is in both spectroscopic and non-spectroscopic systems depending on potential deployment needs. Interest is also in both fixed and portable systems.</p>
<p>Of key interest is the ability to discriminate medical isotopes from threat and non-threat materials.</p>
<p>Fixed sensors are intended for deployment at the entry points to installations. Portable sensors may be deployed at entry points in a semi-permanent fashion or placed in temporary locations on a random basis. Portable sensors will be used to supplement or replace fixed sensors.</p>
<p>Technical requirements and criteria include:</p>
<p>&bull; ANSI N.42 compliance<br />&bull; National Recognized Testing Laboratory (e.g. Underwriters Laboratory) listed<br />&bull; Deployed vs. developmental system<br />&bull; Yearly maintenance and calibration requirements (type and frequency)<br />&bull; Mean time between failure, mean time between repair<br />&bull; Average system availability (lead time)<br />&bull; Infrastructure needs for power, signal, and communication<br />&bull; Networkability (how many systems can populate the same network)<br />&bull; Database structure and storage capability<br />&bull; Ability to discriminate Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material and Medical Isotopes from other sources of radiation<br />&bull; The overall effectiveness of the instruments automated ability to detect and identify (spectral gamma-ray analysis) or discriminate between various sources of radiation is of particular interest<br />&bull; Sensitivity in counts per second per micro-curie for the following isotopes (upper and lower thresholds):<br />&nbsp; o Am-241<br />&nbsp; o Co-60<br />&nbsp; o Cs-137<br />&nbsp; o Ba-133<br />&nbsp; o Co-57<br />&bull; Sensitivity for the following isotopes in counts per second per gram (upper and lower thresholds):<br />&nbsp; o HEU<br />&nbsp; o Weapons Grade Pu<br />&nbsp; o Reactor Grade Pu<br />&nbsp; o DU<br />&bull; Support for external interfaces (traffic lights, extraction of data)<br />&bull; Ability to correctly identify occupancy generating radiation profile (e.g. vehicle detection)<br />&bull; Integral or interface for image capture of occupancy (up to 2 cameras)<br />&bull; Sensitivity to neutrons (if applicable, note upper and lower thresholds)<br />&bull; Response time (time to alarm)<br />&bull; Alarm settings and modes available<br />&bull; Ability to identify and quantify presence multiple isotopes simultaneously</p>
<p>Please note that this is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This is NOT a request for proposal and there is no solicitation package available at this time. Participation does not imply any obligation by Battelle, PNNL, DOE or the United States Government or any agency thereof.</p>
<p>Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law. We will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will we compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to us.</p>

<DESC>The United States Government is seeking sources for Office and Related Space
in the Central Employment Area, Washington, DC.

REQUIREMENT:     The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in Washington, DC, under a lease that expires on November 30, 2008.  The Government is seeking to lease 104,934 BOMA Rentable Square Feet (BRSF) of office and related space, including 6 parking spaces.  The 104,934 BRSF of space must yield at least 96,557 BOMA Area Square Feet (BOASF).  The space must be provided in one building.  The delineated area for this requirement is the Central Employment Area in Washington, DC.  

The requirement is for a 10-year term fully serviced lease with termination options after the 7th year.  The space must be ready for occupancy by December 1, 2008.  

The Government intends to enter into a sole source procurement to remain in its existing leased space but will accept expressions of interest to determine whether there are other potentially acceptable locations that demonstrate the best interests of the Government are served by moving to an alternate location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, relocation costs, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements.  The Government is presently seeking authority to enter into a sole source succeeding lease at the existing location and therefore reserves the right to cancel any ongoing procurement that might result from the identification of other potentially acceptable locations.

The Government’s decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this notification.  In the event that a potentially acceptable offer fails to provide required information as part of its response to this notification, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government’s requirements.

Expressions of interest must be in writing and should be forwarded by 3:00 pm on Friday, September 10, 2008 to:

<DESC><p>This is a Special Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. This is not a solicitation or request for quote.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) acting for the Coordinating Center for Environment Health and Injury Prevention (CCEHIP) intends to award a sole source, firm fixed-price contract to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, 2100 West Harrison Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60612.</p>
<p>Originally, the Government issued a sole source notice posted on FEDBIZOPS May 22, 2008 through June 24, 2008 for the same services and received no capability statements from alternative sources. Subsequently, in an effort to ensure CDC completed the most extensive market research, CDC posted a Sources Sought notice from July 24, 2008 through July 31, 2008. Hektoen submitted the only response. Therefore, the Contracting Officer has confirmed that in fact Hektoen is the only source capable of satisfying the Government's requirement described in the attached statement of work. <br />The purpose of the proposed sole source contract to Hektoen is to provide a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Routine Screening for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) to be conducted by the Collaborative Research Unit at Stroger Hospital. Before IPV can be prevented, research is needed to figure out how big the problem is, where it is, and whom it affects. CDC learns about a problem by gathering and studying data. This data is critical because it helps decision makers use resources where they are needed most. The Collaborative Research Unit at Stroger Hospital is part of a unique forerunner program located in an inner-city public hospital that is a national model for hospital-based domestic violence services and training. The program provides direct services to victims of abuse that include crisis intervention, safety assessment and planning, individual counseling, information about legal rights, court and systems advocacy, access to emergency shelter, financial assistance and referrals to other needed resources. The Collaborative Research Unit possesses the unique conditions and extensive experience for implementing this RCT given their relationship as a partner with a medical school, their highly experienced and qualified epidemiology research unit, high patient load and a renowned IPV advocacy program. These conditions are critical to adequately follow Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved procedures for data collection. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Hektoen Institute for Medical Research is the only source available to provide services that meet mission critical requirements.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 8, 2008 Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responses shall be submitted via email to MEAllen@cdc.gov with the reference RCT for IPV Screening CDC-2008-52592-2 referenced in the subject line.</p>

<DESC>Forty-five (45) days after publication of this notice, the Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intends to issue a contract to Rockwell Collins under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Rockwell Collins is the only known source in the case of a follow-on requirement with the in-depth knowledge and experience to continue into Phase III of the Damage Tolerant Controls program.  The initial technology was developed under two previous phases of Rockwell Collins' (formerly Athena Technologies) research funded by DARPA.  The third phase of research will build upon the previous technology and add additional capability.  The effort involves further development of an integrated, full-mission capability for Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAVs) to autonomously detect and recover from damage that degrades vehicle flight performance and stability.  The Phase III effort will extend technology developed in Phases I and II by incorporating improvements in the algorithms based on experience gained from Phase II flight demonstrations.  Phase III includes integration and flight demonstration of the technology.  The objective of the flight demonstration is to show the utility of these technologies on an operationally representative Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  It is not a solicitation or request for offers.

<DESC>Fifteen days after publication of this notice, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to increase the ceiling on the Nuclear Deterrent and Weapons of Mass Destruction Support (NDWSP) Services IDIQ with SAIC under contract HDTRA1-04-D-0021.  The Government requires immediate and continued support to perform existing and planned tasks over the remaining ordering period through September of 2009.  SAIC has in-depth knowledge and expertise in the areas of nuclear surety, nuclear stockpile issues, nuclear exercise planning, and a unique appreciation and understanding of the national nuclear policy issues that affect DTRA.  As the current supplier of this highly specialized / niche WMD support services, SAIC is the only source capable of fulfilling the Governments’ requirements for continued support and sustainment of the NDWSP program through the remainder of the ordering period up through September 2009.  Therefore, SAIC is the only vendor capable of meeting the Governments’ requirements for WMD support services, time and other factors considered.

<DESC>FPI Production of FSC code  5342 - Hardware, Weapon System
and FSC code 5970 - Electrical Insulators and Insulating Materials



This notice announces FPI’s intentions to produce FSC code 5342- Hardware, Weapon System, and FSC code 5970 - Electrical Insulators and Insulating Materials, which would include boots and transitions, for the Department of Defense on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status.  These products encompass all hardware classified in Federal Supply Classification in FSC code 5342 - Hardware, Weapon System and in FSC code 5970 - Electrical Insulators and Insulating Materials.

Once a product is sold competitively by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI’s Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.  It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI, as is the case for subcontracting and services.

Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI’s Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534. All comments received will be provided to the Board of Directors.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE.  The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to The University of Texas at Austin, Office of Sponsored Projects, PO Box 7726, 101 E. 27th Street, Rm 4306, Austin, TX  78713 for pre-doctoral student services.  The course work and training these students have completed includes emphasis in molecular biology as well as treatment and drug development to ameliorate combat related traumatic injury.  The University of Texas, Austin, School of Pharmacy, prepares students for research positions in pharmaceutical companies around the world.   The School of Pharmacy has agreed to provide a limited number of predoctoral students to provide expertise in the development of drugs to be tested in animal models to ameliorate tissue injury following hemorrhage.  This is a continuation of a research project that has been in effect for 9 years.   There is no other institution of higher learning in south Texas that can provide students to the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research.  The course work and training of these individuals represents an emerging technology that is highly competitive and difficult to obtain in San Antonio, TX.  The University of Texas at Austin is within commuting distance to San Antonio, TX, and this allows access to resources and facilities otherwise unavailable to the US Army.  No solicitation document exists.  There are no other institutions of higher learning in the San Antonio area that are training students with a drug development/molecular biology background.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer within fifteen calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability to provide the stated capability.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at:  USAMRAA, ATTN:  MCMR-AAA-G (Peggi Lesnow), 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD  21702-4014.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

__OPLC system with necessary hardware and some supplies for routine operation in sample separation.
This equipment performs a 2-dimensional separation technique compared to standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is a 1-dimensional separation technique.  HPLC is not a suitable option for the complexity of preparative work necessary for this project.  In essence, OPLC combines all capabilities of HPLC, with those of thin layer chromatography (TLC) and Flash chromatography.  As such, OPLC is the marriage of three techniques that allow unequaled preparative capabilities.____________________________________________________________
Suitable OPLC unit should be capable of using 5 x 20 cm, 10 x 20 cm and 20 x 20 cm size flat columns, and span a variety of stationary phases for normal and reverse phase operation, and include chiral operation potential. The unit should be pressurized to 50bars/725 psi and obtain this pressure in 45 s. The unit should allow preparative scale separations, depending on the column, as follows: 50 mg for 5 x 20 cm columns, 100 mg for 10 x 20 cm, and 200 mg for the 20 x 20 cm columns.  A glass backed column should achieve separation of 500 mg. The nit should have unidirectional, 2-directional, 2-dimensional and circular separation capabilities.  Solvent should be deliverable by HPLC pump. Sample insertion should be accomplished by either sample injection or direct sample application to the sorbent bed. OPLC should be capable of being interfaced with other laboratory detection instruments, such as mass spectrometers, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectrometers. Columns should be removable from the system and any stage during a separation.

<p>With the expanding success of the Global Positioning System (GPS) comes the<br />threat of GPS denial by our adversaries. The 746 TS has assembled an<br />unparalleled suite of threat equipment and capabilities to emulate these<br />possible threats along with developing extensive test methods to test GPS<br />equipment against these electromagnetic signals. The 746 TS can generate<br />almost any GPS threat that would be encountered in the theater of operations<br />utilizing a Portable Field Jamming System (PFJS). Each PBJS is a stand-alone<br />jamming system with a full suite of GPS Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment<br />and a variety of high power adjustable amplifiers. The EW equipment is fully<br />programmable to provide a wide range of jamming scenarios and signal<br />modulations. TMC Design designed/developed the modulation source equipment<br />(TATE) used in our PBJS therefore any new equipment that is integrated in<br />these PBJS must be 100% compatible with previous TATE versions.<br /><br />The TATE-MV provides low to medium power EW signal modulation for test and<br />evaluation purposes. Features include two independently controlled RF<br />outputs, programmable functions and variable output. These RF functions<br />include Continuous Wave (CW), Analog Noise, Sawtooth and BPSK with out-puts<br />capable of varying in frequency and power.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to purchase the following laboratory supplies. Title of Project: Purchase of Sample Introduction Systems and Consumables. Current need is for six sample introduction systems for inductively coupled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometers (ICP-DRC-MS) to upgrade existing instrumentation in the laboratory. Various consumables are also needed for these sample introduction systems and the equipment with which they will operate. The new sample introduction systems will allow for faster sample analysis time (SC-FAST), increased sensitivity (PC3-cooled chambers), and improved precision (SC-FAST and polypropylene nebulizers). Purchase of additional consumables to be kept on hand as spares allows for quick and easy replacement as they reach their life expectancy or become otherwise unusable in the laboratory. This reduces instrument down-time and helps guarantee laboratory response time. C.4 Technical Requirements - See table "technical requirements below.

<p>As an internationally recognized project management expert, incumbent works independently to provide technical consultation on program activities of ongoing or proposed public health programs funded by PEPFAR. Incumbent has the discretion to plan and adjust not only own work, but also the work of others related to the delivery of quality project management services in Zambia.

Incumbent has the freedom to independently take action and make decisions on work area and to work with implementing partners from national and local public health agencies.</p>
<p>Incumbent is required to independently resolve technical and programmatic problems or situations that are encountered. Incumbent's expertise and experience in program and project management demand the ability to resolve even the most difficult problems independently. Similarly, incumbent is expected to anticipate when a project activity may need specific documentation prepared or approved, and plan accordingly (e.g., anticipate when renewal applications are due or funding opportunity announcements must be prepared and ensure that the person(s) responsible for preparing them do so in a timely and thorough manner). Also, as a regular and ongoing part of incumbent's routine activities, is required to carefully scrutinize program plans for accuracy, appropriateness, and to identify any problems that require resolution.</p>
<p>Incumbent has the responsibility to assure that project activity documentation is accurately written and submitted in a timely manner. Activities include building the capacity to develop budgets and work plans, determine and adjust work priorities, and to resolve routine and complex problems for the projects as they arise. Project documents are generally highly technical and critical to the overall process, and require a significant effort to assure the quality of, and progress made in project activities. Incumbent develops relevant technical guidance for use by projects implementing program interventions.

<p><br />Intellectual Skills:</p>
<p>As the senior project management expert for the PEPFAR/USG Technical Working Group, incumbent is required to operate in a highly complex informational environment. Incumbent is expected to have a mastery and specialty expertise in the area of public health project management, specifically in program design and implementation. Incumbent is responsible for developing, disseminating, and evaluating the impact of complex technical policies, procedures, regulations and guidance that will assure a high quality of service delivery by implementing partners. These policies, procedures, etc., come in the form of manuals, technical guidance and informal and formal training. Incumbent must be sensitive to local and national political issues that may affect the implementation of cooperative agreement programs.</p>
<p>The work is highly complex, covering a multitude of projects undertaken by different implementing partners. This requires a highly developed analytical ability and judgment. For example, incumbent must be able to successfully balance differing perspectives while influencing the development of a comprehensive national public health management system. Strong analytical skills, excellent judgment and highly developed negotiating skills are frequently required to arrive at a determination of best options.</p>
<p>Problems encountered are complex and vary considerably.

S/he must be a flexible, pro-active, well-organized and task-oriented manager capable of exercising independent judgment.<br />Most common problems: Typical problems to be resolved independently include: Determining the most efficient methods for developing effective cooperative agreement applications by partners not familiar with USG cooperative and agreement review procedures; dealing with scheduling conflicts between the need to participate in site visits to address project management issues and responding to urgent requests from PEPFAR management for critical program-related information; and, responding to requests for ad hoc assessments/evaluation, frequently with very limited time deadlines.<br />Most difficult problems solved: Developing long-term, sustainable capacity within partners to manage their project management activities so as to move from PEPFAR program-controlled to host nation-controlled systems.</p>
<p>Strategic planning for setting overall direction and goals for national program management is conducted annually with a vision for 3-4 years in the future. Overall work, in terms of major objectives to be accomplished, is planned one year in advance. Day-to-day work is planned one week in advance but the professional and technical nature of this management position require the ability to adjust priorities frequently to enable timely response to unanticipated requests requiring short turnaround.</p>
<p>Because of the complex nature of duties, incumbent is required to be highly innovative in designing project management plans and operational guidelines for monitoring cooperative agreement and grant activities. Incumbent is expected to develop improved methods for program management by implementing partners. Incumbent's expert advice and recommendations are expected to lead implementing partners to improve their program management activities. Incumbent is required to influence the redesign of the public health project management system, particularly within government partners. This effort is expected to result in substantive improvements in the delivery of public health and project management services in Zambia. New and innovative ideas developed by incumbent will strongly influence whether this effort is successful.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase Cisco network equipment through a combination of current fiscal year funding and also through a trade-in credit for existing Cisco components.  This is a continuation of a project that was partially funded in FY07.  The credit will be used towards the purchase of new hardware needed to upgrade the Agency’s network as the transition to the GSA Networx contract moves forward.  New equipment will be shipped to the DCAA Network Operations office where the IT staff will configure the new equipment and then ship equipment to each office.  Once the new equipment arrives at an office, the old equipment will be disconnected and the new equipment installed.  The equipment, routers and switches contain no data, so there is no sanitization process to be conducted.  Once the old router is disconnected, it will be shipped directly to Cisco.   

Contact the contract specialist for a copy of the RFQ and list of bid and trade-in items.

The past performance evaluation will assess the offeror's record of how well the offeror did on work for government and private sector clients. This evaluation will include assessments of the offeror's resilience in the face of trouble, resourcefulness, and management determination to see that the organization lived up to commitments or standards. The government reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews to validate information provided in the past performance questionnaires and to obtain additional information from other internal and external sources, if known. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be given a favorable or unfavorable evaluation rating. The offeror will receive a neutral rating for the past performance factor.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">FACTOR 2: COMPANY EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>The experience of the offeror and of proposed subcontractors and/or partners intended to occupy a major role will be considered in evaluation and selection. The government will evaluate each offeror's corporate experience in providing services, which are of similar nature to the work to be performed under the requirement described in this solicitation. Specifically, jobs that are of similar scope, complexity, contract type, and period of performance, in relation to the requirements of this solicitation are of particular interest to the government. The government reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews to validate corporate experience and to obtain additional information from other internal and external sources, if known.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">FACTOR 3: TECHNICAL APPROACH</strong> <br /><br />The offeror is to address their understanding of FEMA's requirement to include their technical approach to fulfilling the requirement. Specifically, the offeror shall provide a draft Phase-In Plan that addresses how they plan to prepare to assume the maintenance and deactivation requirement from the current contractor. This will include obtaining information/documentation on the occupants who are currently living in the housing units such as their address and contact information, what work has been performed to date, as well as any work that needs to be completed before they are transferred to the new contractor. The phase-in plan shall include a timeline with dates and key tasks to be performed starting with contract award up to acceptance of the first twenty (20) units and what steps will be taken during that time to achieve phase-in and assume regular maintenance and deactivation requirements (i.e. finalizing subcontracts, if applicable; hiring new staff if necessary; training staff on the contract requirements; setting up a service call center finalizing internal standard operating procedures to be used in performing the contract requirements, finalize draft plans, etc.). <br /><br />In addition, the offer shall address their Quality Control Plan (QCP) to be used in the performance of the contract. Specifically, they should address the quality control methods to be used and if they have used them successfully in other work preformed.

Price (Non-Technical Factor): Contractor is to demonstrate the ability to provide a sound competitive offer associated with the services identified within the solicitation. The government will evaluate the offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness.<br /><br />Price, while being an important factor, is not in and of itself the determining factor in the selection of the successful offeror for award of the contract contemplated by this solicitation. Price is not scored/weighted; rather, each offeror's price will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness as compared to Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), prices proposed by other offerors, and/or other cost/price estimates for similar requirements. <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.<br /><br />FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.<br /><br />FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition <br /><br />FAR Clause 52.226-3 Disaster or Emergency Area Representation (Nov 2007) applies to this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with Far 13.5 as applicable and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This is a Request for Quotations (RFQ); a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has a requirement for the following:

 Handheld X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers	5   Ea     $________	$_________
Specifications
Five (5) handheld x-ray fluorescence spectrometers that meet or exceed the following specifications:
Instrument specifications:  
1. Handheld format, weighing less than 10 pounds, and battery operated.
2. Capable of measuring x-ray fluorescence from elements Magnesium through Uranium.
3. The instrument must include a portable central processing device that is capable of controlling the instrument.  A single, portable central processing unit must be capable of supporting the measurement of all elements from magnesium through uranium.  The central processing unit must be capable of storing data, and transferring data to other computers.  The central processing unit must be capable of data transfer by standard USB connection or by Bluetooth wireless data transfer.
4. The instrument must use an x-ray tube source with a rhodium anode.  The x-ray tube is required for safety (i.e., the instrument must not have a radioactive source) and the rhodium anode is required for measurement of high Z elements.  Rhodium is also required because it is not commonly found in pharmaceutical materials, and will therefore not interfere with detection of potential metal impurities in pharmaceutical products.
5. The instrument detector must be capable of collecting and analyzing x-rays at high count rates, exceeding 100,000 x-ray counts per second.  This is required to increase signal-to-noise ratio and decrease measurement time.
6. Instrument bandwidth should not exceed 145 eV full width at half maximum, measured at the manganese K-alpha line at a signal rate typical of routine measurements.  This is required to reduce overlap of nearby peaks in the XRF spectrum, and thereby improve the quantitative accuracy and detection limit of the instrument.  A pertinent measure of detection limit can be demonstrated by the following procedure, which tests the capability of the instrument to measure lead in the presence of a large bismuth background:  (a) Measure and report the unprocessed XRF spectrum of 10 ml of liquid Pepto Bismol (Original Strength) over the 9-15 keV spectral range using a 5 minute integrated collection time.  (b)  Measure and report the unprocessed XRF spectrum of 10 ml of liquid Pepto Bismol (Original Strength) spiked with 0.2 ml of a 10,000 part per million lead standard solution over the 9-15 keV spectral range using a 5 minute integrated collection time.  (c)  Report the difference spectrum between (b) and (a) without smoothing.  (d)  Measure and report the unprocessed XRF spectrum of 10 ml of liquid Pepto Bismol (Original Strength) spiked with 0.02 ml of a 10,000 part per million lead standard solution over the 9-15 keV spectral range using a 5 minute integrated collection time.  (e)  Report the difference spectrum between (d) and (a) without smoothing.  The detection limit will be determined from the difference spectra as the extrapolated concentration that results in a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, the signal being measured as the peak of the lead 10.5 keV line, and the noise being measured as the root mean squared average noise of the spectrum.
7. The instrument must include user-controlled calibration facilities, including selection of up to at least 25 elements for analysis.  The calibration sequence must allow the user to specify concentrations of elements in standard samples for user-defined calibrations.  User-defined calibration options must include linear, quadratic, cubic and higher order polynomial calibration equations.
8. The instrument must have user-controlled instrument control including source voltage and current, and user selectable filters.
9. Instrument must have at least 5 fixed internal filters.
10. Instrument must allow the user to develop methods that utilize at least three filters in a programmable sequence, with user specified calibration.
11. The instrument must be capable of storing sets of user-specified instrument parameters and calibration parameters to support user-generated analytical methods.
12. The instrument must be capable of operation in pass/fail mode on the basis of user-selected calibration and user-specified threshold concentration.
13. The instrument must be capable of operation in fundamental parameters mode.
14. The handheld instrument must include additional portable equipment necessary to facilitate the sensitive determination of light elements, including magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorous, sulfur, chlorine, potassium, calcium and scandium with high sensitivity.
15. The instrument must include a stand to support the instrument on a benchtop.
16. Instrument must include an interface to a user supplied computer via USB or similar common interface.  The instrument must include desktop computer software for analysis and display of data from the handheld instrument.  Desktop software should allow direct control of the handheld XRF spectrometer for calibration and method development.
17. Include one year parts and labor warranty.
18. Include on-site training.

Evaluation will be performed only for existing and prior contracts for work similar in nature and complexity to that required by the solicitation and shall include the following:
A. Quality of Products and Services.  
Demonstrated ability to perform exhibit design and production services in accordance with required design specifications.  Conformance to good standards of workmanship and quality control. (0-10)
B. Customer Satisfaction.  Satisfaction of end users with the completed exhibits and/or displays. (0-10)
C. Timeliness of Performance.  Compliance with delivery schedules; reliability; and responsiveness to technical direction. (0-10)
D. Business Relations.  Effective management, ability to manage projects involving subcontracts, working relationship with the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representatives, reasonable/cooperative behavior, flexibility, effective contractor recommended solutions, businesslike concern for government interests, and provides current, accurate, and complete billings. (0-10)
2. Comprehensive Plan including Project Management - Weight = 30
Evaluation will be based on the adequacy and feasibility of the Comprehensive Plan including quality control and proposed schedule.  Special emphasis will be placed on project management and how well the technical and management approaches will ensure the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of finished products.
3. Samples of Work - Weight = 20
Evaluation will be based on samples of work that demonstrate the ability of proposed personnel and subcontractors to manage and produce graphics and structures that are similar in design and function to wayside exhibits to be fabricated as part of this contract.	
4. Personnel - Weight = 10
Evaluation will be based on the qualifications, education, knowledge, and work experience of all personnel, including subcontractors, proposed for use under the contract.  Special emphasis will be placed on personnel's training and/or experience in the fabrication of tactile graphics or similar types of fabrication.
Award Criteria:	
One award is planned.  A contract will be made to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, cost or price and other factors considered. Technical quality, including past performance, will be considered more important than cost or price. Warranty information will be included in the best value determination.
In the case of an offeror with respect to which there is no information on past contract performance, or with respect to which information on past contract performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past contract performance. In other words, past performance will be treated as neutral. This will be accomplished by giving a new firm the average score of the other competing offeror's and evaluating the proposal in accordance with the other stated evaluation criteria, (FAR 15.608(2)(iii)).		Loaded labor rates will be evaluated to establish the reasonableness of the proposed loaded labor rates in relation to the personnel proposed for the contract. Prices proposed for materials and equipment will also be examined to establish price reasonableness where possible and cost reasonableness, as appropriate. 
Price will be a factor in the award decision, although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest loaded labor rates and prices. Likewise, award will not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. A thorough examination will be made to determine an offerors adequate understanding of the Scope of Work related to proposal presentation, cost and other factors considered. The question to be decided in making the final selection will be whether a proposal scoring better is worth the dollar difference, if any.
As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. As the technical merit and the evaluated cost or price become essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor. The government will consider other factors, as listed below in descending order of importance, secondary to technical, past performance, and cost or price;
(1) HubZone small business concerns;(2) Small business concerns which are also minority owned and operated; (3) Women-owned firms; and(4) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms.
In addition to the evaluation of technical merit, the cost, or price, and other factors, the standards for determining an offeror's responsibility as set forth in FAR 9.104-1, will be examined and considered. Additional factors which are not specifically set forth in this solicitation, but which are prerequisites for award as implied by law, regulation or public policy will be considered in the determination of an offeror's acceptability.
All proposals should be submitted in an original and four copies for receipt no later than 4:00 p.m., EST, September 16, 2008, and shall be clearly marked with Request for Proposal Number N1106080102.  Offerors are hereby notified that if your proposal is not received by the date and time and at the location specified in this announcement that it will be considered late as stated in FAR Part 52.212.1(f).  All offers should be sent to the National Park Service; Harpers Ferry Center; Office of Acquisition Management; Attention: Melody Wolfe, Administrative Specialist; Request for Proposal Number N1106080102; P.O. Box 50; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia 25425-0050.  Proposals by telephone transmitted facsimile (fax) will not be accepted.  
The offeror agrees that the proposal is valid for a period of 90-days after the closing date.

If providing an equal, please comply with FAR Clause 52.211-6, Band Name or Equal. 2. Explain how your company will meet the Salient Characteristics 1 through 13. NOTE: Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient. Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating. 2. Past Performance. Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires from Two (2) firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment. Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote. If an Offeror provides more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision. It is the offerors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnaires directly to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office (see below) by the solicitation closing date and time., the Contracting Officer may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the offerors. 3. Price. 4. Award will be all or none basis. Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria: 1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability. Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2. The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price related factors. In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors. 3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance, and when combined, are significantly more important than price. Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium. The Trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror. Vendors shall comply with FAR 52.211-6 if submitting other than the Brand Name product.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>I was hoping you could answer a question for us, on this solicitation, do we need to include our techs for generator set up and startup? Or will the government be using their techs? And all they want is the equipment delivered.</p>
<p>Answer: We just need the equipment delivered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also want to know if there were any drawings with this solicitation?</p>
<p>Answer: No</p>
<p>Our Manufacture,(Caterpillar) said that we would have to go up to a larger kw size to reach that 4160 volt output, or have two 750kw with a transformer. Need clarification on it being parallel units.</p>
<p>Answer: Generator shall be as specified, 4160 volt output.&nbsp; That applies for both generators.&nbsp; No transformers are required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The specifications ask for engine cooling remote cooler. Are or are not the radiators installed? Are they remotely located outside the units? <br />Is start of required, or will the government provide the installation of these units?</p>
<p>Answer: The radiators are remote and are not included in this contract.&nbsp; The installation will be made by the government upon delivery of the units.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers

1. In the Revised Statement of Work is specifies Single Mode fiber optic cable, outside application, hard jacket - loose buffer, 24 fibers.
 
Could you define "hard jacket"?
 
Is it an armored fiber?

Response- The cable doesn't need to be armored cable. 
 
Loose tube cable with hard buffer tubes is what is meant by loose buffer hard jacket.
Loose Tube Cable contains one or more hard buffer tubes. The hard buffer tubes are also filled with a gel to provide vibration and moisture protection for the fibers. The fibers lie loosely in the tubes, which are wound into the cable in a reversing helical fashion and are actually longer than the outer sheath of the cable. Loose tube cable is used most often in construction because it is designed for a tough outdoor environment use. 

2. Can offers be emailed?

Response- Yes.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions regarding the solicitation.
Q1:  What are the specific instructions for submitting a cost/price proposal?A1:  Please provide a cost proposal in the form of a loaded/burdened hourly rate.  All travel required will be reimbursed at the current rate allowable in the Federal Travel Regulations on the date of travel.
Q2:  What are the formatting guidelines for the quote?A2: A resume providing information with regard to the qualifications in the statement of work and a summary of the understanding of the requirements is sufficient for the technical portion.  You have the option of sending selected examples of your work or providing direct links to selected publications of your related work, within the published guidelines.
Q3:  The assumption is that forms 1034, 1034(a) and/or 1035(a) are only to be completed if/when requesting payment for services rendered.  Is the correct?A3: This is correct.  
Q4: The assumption is that it will be the responsibility of MMS to compile the board of 3-6 members based on the proposals received.  Is this correct?A4: This is correct.  MMS expects to receive proposals of individuals, not proposals for compiling the complete board.
Q5a: Offeror Representations and Certifications: What format is acceptable for submission of representations and certifications the annual electronic version has not been completed?A5a: You can either hand write or type the information into the form.  Or, visit http://acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_212_213.html and copy and paste the information from 52.212-3 into a word document and fill out the information.
Q5b: There is a lower-case "o" in many of the clauses, what does this "o" mean?A5b: The lower-case "o" is indicative of a "checkbox".  For example: in paragraph (b)(4) "Type of Organization" there are several selections with an "o" just before the type of organization.  You can check this box manually or place an "X" where the "o" is for the appropriate type of organization.  Also, in paragraph (c)(1) the sentence is "The offeror represents as a part of its offer that is "o" is or "o" is not a small business concern".  The company should check the "o" or mark with an X the appropriate selection whether or not they are a small business.

<DESC>The following are answers to questions received:

Question 1) The bolt hole circles pattern is different with our cryostat. Is  this acceptable to BID? 

Answer 1) We have specified bolt patterns for the top plate and for the mounting
plate, both of which must be adhered to.

Question 2) NIST requirements in particular the length and the top plate free
area. Is it possible to have a longer cryostat and wider above the tail and if so is there a limit? Is this acceptable to BID? 

Answer 2) The specification on the upper diameter limit is required as well as
the limit on overall height 720 mm and 950 mm respectively.

Question 3) The system would have to operate in persistent mode to ensure re-
condensing. Is this acceptable to BID? 

Answer 3) We have requested cryo-free with no persistent mode. We have allowed
systems with minimal condensed volume of He-4 to bid but we prefer all
cryo-free (just closed cycle fridge).

Question 4) Bore 82 mm in magnet, 152 mm above. Is this acceptable to BID?

Answer 4) Yes those specifications 82 mm and 152 mm for the warm bore (inside
wall diameter) exceed our minimum specification.

Question 5) In the event of a power outage or refrigerator failure the helium autonomy will allow uninterrupted operation for several hours or allow for controlled run down. Is this acceptable to BID?

Answer 5) Yes, acceptable.

The due date and time for quotations remains the same.

Designed specifically for use with Nikon D1/D2-series and D100 digital SLR cameras, it features wideangle zoom capability, ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass and Nikon's exclusive built-in SWM (Silent Wave Motor). The lens is targeted at professional and advanced amateur Nikon D-SLR users who demand both the advantages of high optical performance and wideangle focal zoom range.This G-type Nikkor lens is designed with no aperture rings, and offers easier, virtually mistake-free operation because the aperture does not need to be set to minimum. Equivalent focal length in 35mm is 25.5-85.5mm. The Nikon Telephoto AF-S Nikkor 500mm f/4G ED VR LensThe Nikon Telephoto AF-S Nikkor 500mm f/4G ED VR Lens is a premium ultrafast telephoto lens for the Nikon autofocus system. It is a very robust and durable lens. Its lightweight construction incorporates a magnesium die-cast barrel, and professional-grade dust and moisture sealing allows it to be used in more rugged situations. This lens features the improved Vibration Reduction (VR II) system that allows handheld telephoto shooting, even in less-than-ideally lit conditions. The VR system minimizes image blur caused by camera shake, and offers the equivalent of shooting at a shutter speed of about 4 stops faster. In addition, this lens also features the Tripod Detection mode, which reduces vibration that may occur due to shutter release, when mounted on a tripod. The Silent Wave Motor (SWM) feature provides swift autofocus with superior accuracy and ultra-quiet operation. This G-type lens does not feature an aperture ring on the lens body, resulting in a lighter and more compact lens. Aperture changes are designed to be done via the camera's command dial. Note: VR function is only compatible with Nikon's F5, F100, N80, N65, D70, D100 & D1-series (or later generation) cameras.AF-S feature is not supported by certain older camera models.

<DESC>THIS IS A Request for Information (RFI) NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. THIS RFI IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. The Naval Systems Engineering Directorate (SEA 05) of the Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is seeking information from vendors with experience in applying systems and component specifications and standards used in Navy shipbuilding and weapons and combat system acquisition programs to assist SEA 05 in identifying significant cost drivers associated with these programs and to recommend steps toward reducing the cost associated with the use of these specifications and standards in building a more affordable future fleet. This assessment should concentrate on the impact these requirements have on design, manufacturing, testing, and inspection costs. In assessing the cost impact of the specifications and standards when making a cost/benefit comparison, sources are encouraged to consider the unique needs of warships and of the combat and weapons control systems which they carry. Your recommendations will have greater impact during the evaluation phase of this study if they clearly consider the world-wide operating environment of the U.S. Navy and the additional man-made environments (weapons effects) to which a warship and its systems are exposed when the ship is fulfilling its design purpose (i.e., surviving and overcoming the enemy in combat). The list of applicable specifications and standards subject to this request for information is provided below. Copies of these specifications and standards may be obtained from the ASSIST Website or by requesting a copy from the Government point of contact provided. ASSIST is the official database containing information about standardization documents used in DoD. Assist is located online at http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch (no password required) or http://assist.daps.dla.mil (password required).
a) MIL-S-901 Shock Technical Area (including MIL-S-901, NAVSEA 0908-LP-000-3010, Design Data Sheet DDS 072-1, Ship Specification Section 072).b) Noise Technical Area (including MIL-STD-167/1 and MIL-STD-740)c) NVR Chapter 8 relative to MIL-STD-1689 and MIL-STD-278 Fabrication requirementsd) MIL-M-17060 Motors, 60 Cycle, Alternating Current, Integral HP, Shipboard Usee) MIL-STD-777 Schedule of Piping, Valves, Fittings and Associated Piping Components for Naval Surface Shipsf) MIL-DTL-16036 Switchgear, Power, Low Voltage, Naval Shipboard in conjunction with use of MIL-Spec circuit breakers (MIL-C-17587, MIL-C-17361)g) MIL-STD-461E - Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)h) MIL-STD 464A Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Requirements for Systems i) MIL-STD-469B \ NTIA Chapter 5 Radar Interface Requirements
Respondents must be a System Integrator and/or Original Equipment Manufacturer using any or all of the specifications and standards listed above in the development, production, and sustainment of its products and have proven experience to support the cost and benefit comparison provided by the respondent with regard to:
1) Specification/Standard Content, Application, and Interpretation 
a) Specification/Standard Content: The technical requirements associated with specifications and standards stated above are accurate and the costs associated with meeting specifications and standards requirements far exceed the differential benefit received through compliance.b) Specification/Standard Application/Invocation: The content is reasonable, but not appropriate for non-critical applications and thus differing applications could reduce costs. i.e., What are the criteria of "non-critical" systems that the Specification/Standard should not apply to and what requirements of the Specification/Standard can be waived?c) Specification/Standard Interpretation: Content and Application may be appropriate, but interpretation/enforcement practices add unnecessary costs. i.e., What standardization of the test criteria for each Specification/Standard is required to eliminate the contention of whether a system is meeting the requirements? Does the Specification/Standard provide clear instruction on how each test is performed? Is the Specification or Standard invoked in a consistent and appropriately tailored form in the procurement documentation (Statement of Work, Ship Specification, and/or Weapons Specification)?d) General assessment of costs drivers (i.e., labor, materials, administration, etc) 
(2) Identification of potential alternatives (such as the use of commercial specifications or standards) for each of the targeted specifications and standards:
a) Equivalent commercial standards and specifications addressing the same issues for the requirements of interest.b) Where applicable, the interrelationship among the commercial specifications and standards and Military Specifications and Standards.c) The criteria that the commercial specifications and standards must meet so that the Military Standard could be replaced.
(3) Recommended steps to validate and implement lower cost alternatives 
(4) For Shipyard processes, please address the following:
a) Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on redesign.b) Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on installation costs.c) Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on testing costs.d) Quantify the impact of meeting the specification or standard on other costs.
Interested sources are requested to provide UNCLASSIFIED documentation describing the potential cost savings which could reasonably be attributed to the modification of the Specification/Standard described by the respondent or resulting from the improved tailoring of the application of the Specification/Standard. This documentation should not exceed 30 pages in length. After government personnel have evaluated the respondents submissions, the government may elect to have its personnel contact a subset of the respondents to obtain additional information regarding the information provided by the respondent with respect to this request for information on the same terms as set forth below for this request for information.
RESPONSES SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: Company name; Address; Point of Contact; Phone Number; and E-mail address. All information submitted in response to this synopsis shall be received not later than 30 days following issuance of this RFI. All submissions must be made electronically, and be in one of the following formats: Adobe PDF, or Microsoft Word and must be submitted to Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division 5001 South Broad Street, Building 4, Philadelphia, PA 19112, Attn: Doris Tung or emailed directly to doris.tung@navy.mil. Telephonic responses are not acceptable. The Government may not respond to any specific questions or comments submitted in response to this request for information. Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this request for information is strictly voluntary. This request for information is for information gathering and planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. All documentation shall become the property of the Government. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this request for information. This request for information is a market research tool being used to expand the governments knowledge of potential cost savings associated with the construction, testing, deployment, and sustainment of Naval vessels and the systems which they carry. All firms responding to this request for information are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced later via NECO/FedBizopps and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the response to this request for information. Response to this notice is not a request to be added to a bidders list or to receive a copy of a solicitation. 
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.

<SUBJECT>SENSORS AVAILABLE FOR DETECTION OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS AND/OR SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL AT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INSTALLATIONS
<SOLNBR>GUARDIAN
<CONTACT>Shannon C. Malisani, Contracts Specialist, Phone 5093756814, Email shannon.malisani@pnl.gov
<DESC><p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle), operator of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public and private), or other sources about commercially or government available equipment, or near-commercial technologies that may be used for the detection of radioactive materials and/or special nuclear materials at Department of Defense (DoD) installations.
<p>This request for information (RFI) is part of an overall strategy to identify the next generation of radiological interdiction equipment for fielding as soon as next fiscal year, which begins October 1, 2008. The information obtained by this RFI will be included in a market survey that will be coupled with a test campaign to determine what system or systems should be recommended to the client for fielding. The phasing of this strategy may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Sources sought announcement<br />&bull; Market study and preliminary testing (PNNL may test systems upon request of the vendors)<br />&bull; Ranking and formal testing (top 2-5 systems based on ranking criteria may be tested by PNNL)<br />&bull; Recommendation (top 1-3 systems) that may include one or more of the following:<br />&nbsp; o Spectroscopic<br />&nbsp; o Non-spectroscopic<br />&nbsp; o Portable system<br />&bull; Procurement action<br />&bull; Acceptance testing<br />&bull; Prototype fielding<br />&bull; Unrestricted fielding<br />&bull; Lifecycle maintenance and improvements</p>
<p>Interested organizations/companies/institutions may propose to have their equipment tested at PNNL or provide PNNL with the results of a screening test procedure as part of the aforementioned market survey. The screening procedure will be provided upon request. NOTE: equipment provided to PNNL for testing must be &lsquo;cord and plug' and should be National Recognized Testing Laboratory (e.g. Underwriters Laboratory) listed.</p>
<p>PNNL is interested in information on systems that would be usable for improved sensing of radioactive materials in commercial vehicles of all sizes and shapes, and personal vehicles of all sizes and shapes. Both high volume screening instruments, and detailed inspection instruments are of interest. Specifically, PNNL is looking for information regarding the expected technical capability and effectiveness of currently (or soon to be) available instrumentation with respect to expected threats given the speed, distance, shielding, etc. conditions that are typically found at vehicle crossings. Operational issues, specifically detection probabilities and false alarm probabilities for typical measurement conditions are of particular interest. Other issues that might impact operations, such as required facility modifications, reliability and robustness, training requirements (must not require extensive user training), and health and safety issues are also of interest.</p>
<p>Interest is in both spectroscopic and non-spectroscopic systems depending on potential deployment needs. Interest is also in both fixed and portable systems.</p>
<p>Of key interest is the ability to discriminate medical isotopes from threat and non-threat materials.</p>
<p>Fixed sensors are intended for deployment at the entry points to installations. Portable sensors may be deployed at entry points in a semi-permanent fashion or placed in temporary locations on a random basis. Portable sensors will be used to supplement or replace fixed sensors.</p>
<p>Technical requirements and criteria include:</p>
<p>&bull; ANSI N.42 compliance<br />&bull; National Recognized Testing Laboratory (e.g. Underwriters Laboratory) listed<br />&bull; Deployed vs. developmental system<br />&bull; Yearly maintenance and calibration requirements (type and frequency)<br />&bull; Mean time between failure, mean time between repair<br />&bull; Average system availability (lead time)<br />&bull; Infrastructure needs for power, signal, and communication<br />&bull; Networkability (how many systems can populate the same network)<br />&bull; Database structure and storage capability<br />&bull; Ability to discriminate Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material and Medical Isotopes from other sources of radiation<br />&bull; The overall effectiveness of the instruments automated ability to detect and identify (spectral gamma-ray analysis) or discriminate between various sources of radiation is of particular interest<br />&bull; Sensitivity in counts per second per micro-curie for the following isotopes (upper and lower thresholds):<br />&nbsp; o Am-241<br />&nbsp; o Co-60<br />&nbsp; o Cs-137<br />&nbsp; o Ba-133<br />&nbsp; o Co-57<br />&bull; Sensitivity for the following isotopes in counts per second per gram (upper and lower thresholds):<br />&nbsp; o HEU<br />&nbsp; o Weapons Grade Pu<br />&nbsp; o Reactor Grade Pu<br />&nbsp; o DU<br />&bull; Support for external interfaces (traffic lights, extraction of data)<br />&bull; Ability to correctly identify occupancy generating radiation profile (e.g. vehicle detection)<br />&bull; Integral or interface for image capture of occupancy (up to 2 cameras)<br />&bull; Sensitivity to neutrons (if applicable, note upper and lower thresholds)<br />&bull; Response time (time to alarm)<br />&bull; Alarm settings and modes available<br />&bull; Ability to identify and quantify presence multiple isotopes simultaneously</p>
<p>Please note that this is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This is NOT a request for proposal and there is no solicitation package available at this time. Participation does not imply any obligation by Battelle, PNNL, DOE or the United States Government or any agency thereof.</p>
<p>Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law. We will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will we compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to us.</p>
<p>Interested organizations/companies/institutions are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing a short written summary (no longer than twenty pages) of their equipment capabilities. Summaries are due no later than 12 PM (Noon) Pacific Daylight Time, Friday, September 12, 2008.

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  a) The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of four multidiscipline Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC). These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence for the required work. b) The contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Ft. Stewart Directorate of Public Works for use on federal projects at Ft. Stewart or Ft Benning Directorate of Public Works for use on federal projects at Ft. Benning or use on federal projects under the jurisdiction of the Savannah District and, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers Districts within the SERO of IMA.  All Architects and Engineers (AE) are cautioned to review the restrictions of FAR 9.5 Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest and 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer Firms. Any AE that prepares a Design-Build Request for Proposal for a particular project will be restricted from participating in any contract or task order for the Design-Build of that particular project.  If awarded a contract resulting from this announcement, AE’s are reminded that they may decline to accept a task order, which is appropriately placed on the contract, only in accordance with the terms and conditions of FAR contract clause 52.216-19 Order Limitations.     Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval. Contract limits and contract size will be determined at the time of selection. *** c) The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract. The contract will be for one basic ordering period and two option periods with a total contract limit of $4,500,000.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. *** d) Task Orders will be primarily for small projects with a construction value typically under $2 million; however, if required, larger projects will be executed under this contract.
