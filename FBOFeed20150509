FOB ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control
activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight
critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to

similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for
source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>This Request&nbsp;for Information is to encourage early industry involvement for the Range Support Services (RSS) II contract.&nbsp; This is for informational purposes only and information contained herein may change as the strategy is finalized.&nbsp; Services are to be performed at the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR).&nbsp; Contract award is anticipated by June 2017 with a contract transition start date of 01 July 2017.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Government is anticipating release of the&nbsp;RSS II&nbsp;Request <a></a>for Proposal (RFP) Fall of 2015.&nbsp; This will be a full and open, two (2) phase source selection, utilizing Best&nbsp;Value<a></a>Trade-off source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.&nbsp; The Government is encouraging teaming arrangements from offerors<a></a><a></a><a></a>.&nbsp; Only the three (3) most highly evaluated&nbsp;offeror <a></a><a></a><a></a>teams will be provided the RFP in Phase 2.&nbsp; Based upon previous industry feedback, each&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a><a></a> team will be provided no more than twenty (20) program briefed personnel positions for proposal development in Phase 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estimated value of this acquisition is $3.6B<a></a><a></a><a></a>.&nbsp; The Government anticipates a single&nbsp;award of a Requirements contract.&nbsp; (While the Government will abide by the intent of the Requirements contract wherein the contractor will receive the preponderance of the work identified in the PWS, the Government will reserve the right to meet mission needs, a large in-flux of customer requirements due to DoD shifting priorities, or work that falls under a governance structure, such as construction, through other means of support (e.g.&nbsp;government or through other contracts).)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The&nbsp;resulting contract&nbsp;will&nbsp;have a potential 16-year period of performance (including options and award terms) plus be a 3-month transition period beginning on 01 July 2017.&nbsp; The pricing arrangements will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP<a></a><a></a><a></a>) (transition in), Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF<a></a><a></a><a></a>) (range support services - organic labor (e.g. prime plus teaming partners)), and Cost&nbsp;Reimbursable<a></a> (CR)(travel, material, non-organic labor sub-contracts, and other direct costs).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a></a><a></a><a></a>Offeror&nbsp;teams responding to this requirement must meet the following criteria.&nbsp; The Government will not entertain any offers that do not meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Offeror teams may not have any foreign ownership, control, or influence.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offeror<a></a><a></a><a></a> teams must meet all requirements of the attached draft DD Form 254 (e.g.&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a><a></a> teams must have&nbsp;Special<a></a>&nbsp;Access Program Facility (SAPF<a></a><a></a><a></a>).&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp;The Government anticipates the formal DD Form 254 to be released within the next 2 weeks.)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offeror<a></a><a></a><a></a> teams must have&nbsp;a proposal<a></a>&nbsp;team that has TS/SSBI<a></a><a></a><a></a> clearances and is program&nbsp;briefable<a></a><a></a><a></a> on Day 1 of Phase 2.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; See the attached security questionnaire required from every member of the proposal team.&nbsp; Any "yes" answers on the questionnaire is likely to result in an individual not being&nbsp;briefable<a></a><a></a><a></a> due to time to adjudicate.)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Proposals will only be accepted from&nbsp;offeror<a></a><a></a> teams that have experience in all&nbsp;functional<a></a><a></a>&nbsp;areas of the Performance Work Statement (PWS<a></a><a></a>).</p>
