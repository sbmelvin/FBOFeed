STATEMENT OF WORK:

1.0	Introduction: The National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system was initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help state health departments establish and maintain a surveillance system to monitor selected behaviors and access to prevention services among groups at highest risk for HIV infection. Findings from NHBS will be used to enhance understanding of risk and testing behaviors, and to develop and evaluate HIV prevention programs.  

NHBS activities are being implemented in multiple cycles.  During the first cycle of data collection (December 2003 – December 2004), surveillance activities focused on men who have sex with men (MSM).  The focus of the second cycle (January 2005 – December 2005) will be on injecting drug users (IDUs). The third cycle (January 2006 – December 2006) will focus on surveillance activities on high risk heterosexuals (HRH). These cycles will be repeated over time such that data are collected from any given risk group every three years.  Each cycle is referred to by the group of interest: NHBS-MSM; NHBS-IDU; NHBS-HRH. 

For NHBS-IDU cycle, Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) will be used to recruit injecting drug users for surveillance data collection.  RDS starts with a limited number of peers, known as seeds, who usually are chosen by referral from key informants.  These “seeds” then recruit their peers into the study, who in turn, recruit their peers. There is a dual incentive system:  incentives are offered for participating and for recruiting.  Those who agree to become recruiters receive a set number of coupons.  The recruitment process and the coupons are tracked using a coupon manager program.  For analysis of data collected through RDS, all participants are asked a set number of questions such as their network size, the relationship between the participant and the recruiter, characteristics of anyone who refused a coupon. 

To implement RDS, peer recruitment, distribution and redemption of referral coupons, and incentive payments must be managed and monitored.  An electronic coupon manager program is needed for this purpose.  To the best of our knowledge, there are 3 commercially available coupon manager programs that have been developed to date: 1) the Identification and Reward Information System (IRIS), 2) IRISPlus (IRIS+), and 3) the RDS Coupon Manager (RDSCM) program.  

The original IRIS software program was developed by Douglas Heckathorn in 1993.  It is a DOS-based program and was last used in 1999.  This software is limited in that it can not be operated in a MS Window environment and will support only a limited sample size.  The IRIS+ program was developed in 2002 by Robert Broadhead and Orlando Rodriguez.  The IRIS+ program translated the original IRIS software into MS Access.  This software is limited in that it can only be operated using MS Access, which is prohibited by CDC,  and contains extraneous features not needed for NHBS-IDU (e.g. features for intervention monitoring). The RDSCM program version 1.0 was developed in 2004 by Douglas Heckathorn.  RDSCM is a Java-based program and uses the HSGL database engine.  Therefore, RDSCM is the most suitable software program for NHBS-IDU, as it does not require MS Access, it can operate in a MS Windows environment, and it can be tailored to the specific needs of NHBS-IDU.

The purpose of this contract is to create a new version of the RDS Coupon Manger (RDSCM) Version 1.0 program to meet the needs and specifications of NHBS-IDU. The resulting Coupon Manager program will be referenced to herein as “RDSCM version 2.0”. The purpose of this contract is also to provide training and technical assistance for the RDSCM and RDSAT software programs.

2.0	Period and Place of Performance: All work described in this task will be performed at the contractor’s facilities.  Contractor must be accessible by phone, fax, and email.  Duration of this task is from April 30, 2006 (or date of award) through April 30, 2008.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of high-voltage, high-frequency switching power conversion.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. 

All of the military services are moving to more electric platforms.  As such, high efficiency and compact electrical power conversion is essential to fielding tactical systems.  The DARPA Wide Band Gap Semiconductor Technology High Power Electronics Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs recently demonstrated the silicon carbide based semiconductor device technology necessary to enable high-voltage, high-frequency switching power conversion.  It is anticipated that this technology will enable the high-voltage, high-frequency switching required for a maritime ready Solid State Power Substation (SSPS) development in this Phase 3 effort.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  

I.  Base Technical Area:  Single-Phase Demonstrator.
The focus is to design and construct a single-phase demonstration of the SSPS by possibly employing the use of silicon carbide based semiconductor devices to enable the system-integrated three-phase SSPS of a proposed Option.  The challenges are on the high voltage primary side of the SSPS rather than the low voltage section which is considered a proven technology.  It is anticipated that the offeror will demonstrate (1) rectification of  single-phase 13.8/ square root 3 kV 60 Hz AC to DC, (2) inversion to 15-25 kHz AC, (3) supply of the AC to a high frequency transformer and (4) rectification at the secondary of the high frequency transformer.  It is anticipated that the demonstration will be done at full-power, namely 920 kVA for a single phase.  The offeror should plan on producing a 700V DC output (or an appropriate DC voltage for future inversion to 465V AC) from the secondary connection of the High Frequency (HF) transformer.  The HF transformer should operate at 15-25 kHz.  It is anticipated that the single-phase SSPS will operate continuously at the 0.92 MVA level. 

Actual thermal consideration may be done by the easiest and most practical method available, but should not be considered an integrated solution.  However, the thermal consideration must be compatible with the work that will be performed in the Option.  The single-phase solution should establish the technology base for the full three-phase design such that a complete rework is not required.  It is not necessary to build for shock but the design should not prohibit shock qualification as necessary for the complete system in the Option.  A physical, thermal and electrical model of the SSPS system shall be provided.

II.  Option Technical Area:  Three-Phase System.
The offeror is expected to design and demonstrate a complete three-phase 2.75 MVA continuously rated unit.  The primary and secondary RMS line-line sinusoidal voltages are 13.8 kV and 465 V at 60 Hz plus or minus 3 percent, respectively.  It is suggested that the offeror leverage the work and analysis performed for the SSPS in the Phase 3 Base Program.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-30 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

This two part solicitation supports work to develop an SSPS that incorporates: high-voltage, high-frequency silicon carbide semiconductor components; a high frequency transformer for galvanic isolation; control electronics; and complete SSPS integration. 

The Phase 3 program will consist of two parts with metrics as shown in Table I.  The Base Program focuses on the design and construction of a single-phase SSPS demonstration; this is followed by an option to design and construct a fully integrated three-phase SSPS system.  The single-phase SSPS, to be developed in the Base Program, is considered a laboratory demonstration and will not include the full system integration.  However, the technology and approach demonstrated in the Base Program by the offeror must be consistent with the technology deemed necessary to develop the full system-integrated three-phase SSPS proposed by the offeror for option phase. 

TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS

Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site - http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Ms. Sharon Beermann-Curtin, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA06-30@darpa.mil.

The system is being procured for 9 AMC general libraries and the Air Mobility Warfare Center, Ronald R. Fogleman academic library.  The 9 base libraries include Charleston, Dover, Fairchild, Grand Forks, MacDill, McConnell, McGuire, Scott, and Travis.  This system will provide AMC libraries with an Application Services Provider (ASP), who will host and maintain the server for the Unicorn system at their location.

This will allow customer to save time and to eliminate the frustration that occurs when customers are required to access separate databases individually in order to retrieve all the information they are searching for job, education, or quality of life needs.  The system will provide a listing of all the materials, as well as provide full-text of articles and books available through the online catalog, databases, and other electronic resources provided by AMC and the Air Force Library Information System programs.  Customers should be able to access this service on a 24-hour basis at any location (i.e. office, home, etc.) that has online access.  This ASP service will be used throughout all of AMC.  The resultant contract will be firm fixed price from contract award through 30 Sep 06 for the base period with four (4) one (1) year option periods. See numbered Note 22.  Verbal requests will not be acted upon.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511.

<DESC>KC-135 Tanker Replacement Program (KC-X) and Complementary Capabilities           

KC-135 Tanker Replacement Program (KC-X) and Complementary Capabilities


FOR PLANNING PURPOSES

The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Tanker Systems Modernization Systems Squadron (TSMSS), ASC Mobility Systems Wing/TSMSS, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is submitting a Request for Information (RFI).  The purpose of this two part RFI is to ensure early industry involvement in the effort.  Part A requests information on KC-X platforms and concepts, whereas Part B requests information on complementary Air Refueling (AR) capabilities.  The Tanker Systems Modernization Systems Squadron is currently seeking information to gain insight into the market to determine if there are potential sources that would be interested in providing a refueling capability.  The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time. 

This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this advertisement.  This is a request for information/market research announcement for planning purposes and the Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request.  Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  

Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.  This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation.  It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.

REQUIREMENT     


       PART A - Tanker Recapitalization Capability Criteria.  The primary purpose of the KC-X program is to replace the war-fighting capability provided by the KC-135 fleet.  The KC-X aircraft is expected to provide world-wide [Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) compliant], day/night, adverse weather, probe/drogue and boom/receptacle AR (including provisions for multiple point, simultaneous air refueling operations) on the same sortie to fixed-wing, receiver-capable United States, allied, and coalition military aircraft (including un-inhabited air vehicles).  KC-X may be employed to support global attack, air-bridge, deployment, Re-deployment, homeland defense, theater support to joint, allied, coalition air and maritime forces; and specialized national defense missions.  Some of these aircraft will be used to support special operations and U.S. nuclear forces.  KC-X may allow for mixing of secondary missions in a manner not to significantly impact its primary AR mission.  Secondary missions for KC-X may include cargo and/or passenger transportation, aero-medical evacuation, and Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) augmentation.

The Air Force is requesting information and recommendations in the following areas:

- Delivery of AR capability to include the following or combinations thereof:

	-- New and/or used commercial derivative tanker aircraft, including availability and acquisition timing of any suggested combinations.

	-- Medium and/or large commercial derivative tanker aircraft (approximately 300K lbs to 1000K lbs maximum take off gross weight).  

- Economic, performance, risk and logistics assessment capabilities of the above options or any combination of these options.  Acquisition options to be assessed also include multi-role tanker, cargo and passenger configurations. 

- AR concepts of operation, technology, design, development and test. Consideration should be given to direct-view versus remote operating stations for AR operator workstation, and the impacts and benefits of advanced technology on AR operator capabilities.

- Offeror’s experience in aircraft design and/or modification capabilities to incorporate CNS/ATM compliant systems; military defensive systems; military communications equipment with strategic and tactical interconnectivity; and night vision internal, external and flight deck illumination.  Also, capabilities for evaluating impacts and recommended approaches for Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) hardening.

- Offeror’s experience in fielding of fully integrated commercial and/or government support systems for military aircraft.  Previous experience (if any) in implementing Public-Private Partnerships and performance based logistics concepts is requested. 

- Understanding and previous experience in obtaining FAA (or equivalent) type certificates or supplemental type certificates shall be demonstrated.  Submit evidence of any FAA or equivalent production, repair or alteration station licenses.

- We are also interested in assessing the impact that potential events would have on this procurement.  Please identify and quantify how the following may affect the life cycle costs of the KC-X program.

	-- Business arrangements that involve a financial contribution from government, including an offeror’s receipt of subsidies; financing (such as “launch aid”) for design and development; grants and government-provided goods and services to develop, expand or upgrade manufacturing sites; loans on preferential terms; assumption and forgiveness of debt resulting from launch and other production and development financing; equity infusions and grants; or research and development loans or grants.

	-- Any change in the above business arrangements.

	-- Application of retaliatory duties that may be imposed pursuant to the aircraft litigation at the World Trade Organization.  
 

     PART B - Complementary Tanker Support Capability Criteria.  Over and above the effort described in Part A, the Air Force is also requesting information on complementary capabilities that would support, augment or enhance our air refueling mission, such as specialized (niche) Fee-for-Service support or modifications/upgrades to maintain KC-135 force structure as we recapitalize the tanker fleet.  The Air Force will also consider vendor inputs on the following:  

- Outsourcing a portion of the needed AR capability from private companies instead of providing it organically. :

	-- Potential mission, uses and DoD benefits

	-- Aircraft number, type and mission availability

	-- Candidate refueling systems/subsystems

	-- Schedule of potential service availability date(s)

	-- Financial arrangements and anticipated fees (cost) to government

	-- Liabilities and indemnification approach

	-- Potential basing locations and operational limitations

	-- Potential other aircraft missions with operational availability impacts

	-- Offeror’s experience in acquiring, modifying and/or maintaining aircraft and any experience in AR concepts of operation with DoD aircraft.

- KC-135 Modifications/Upgrades.  Specific information is requested in the following areas:

	-- Modifications/upgrades to maintain KC-135 force structure during transition to the KC-X fleet.  Possibilities include KC-135E struts/pylons, engines, avionics and flight deck, or complete KC-135E to KC-135R conversion

	-- High maintenance and obsolete parts upgrades

	-- Aircraft quantity for upgrades

	-- Economic, performance, risk and logistics assessment of the above options or any combination of these options.  Analysis should include proposed use within the overall framework of total KC-135 recapitalization, and the projected service life benefit.

	-- Offeror’s experience in aircraft design and/or modification capabilities to incorporate major aircraft upgrades including struts/pylons, engines, avionics and flight deck.


     GENERAL INFORMATION  

  Should the Air Force decide to pursue either a KC-X program, a KC-135 Modification/Upgrade, Complementary Tanker Services, or a combination of the above, offerors meeting the above criteria may be requested to supply additional information on their specific capabilities in future draft Requests for Proposal (RFPs).

If subsequent RFPs are released, a Notice of Contract Action will be published at least 15 days prior.  

For Government planning purposes, anyone intending to submit information for either Part A or Part B is requested to notify the Government within 14 calendar days.

A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Children’s Specialized Hospital, 150 New Providence Road, Mountainside, New Jersey 07092 for the NIMH Project entitled “Clinical and Immunological Investigation of Regression in Autism”, clinical trial #NCT00298246.  The current investigation will focus on the interrelationship between regression in autism and immune dysfunction.  Specifically, Children’s Specialized Hospital will characterize and validate the regression phenotype in children with autism; to characterize the immune response in children with autism, and to identify the neurobiological markers for autism through the techniques of metabolomics, proteomics and genomics.

Children’s Specialized Hospital provides clinical assessment and care to more than 1,000 children with autism in New Jersey.  There is a continual recruitment of young patients and follow-up.  This allows Children’s Specialized Hospital to follow these patients for periods of time. This reduces the time due to recruitment and related expenses.

An award to any other source would affect the NIH prior and current research involving the recruitment and evaluation of very young child with autism and would not provide any cost savings to the Government; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1).     

Period of Performance will be 12 months. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.5 million. 

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.     The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

This contract will be awarded in support of the Propulsion and Power Department.  The storage systems will be installed in Room 147 of Building 1461, and Room 37 of Bldg. 2360.  See Attachment 1 for Building 1461 Statement of Work and Specifications and see Attachment 2 for Building 2360 Statement of Work and Specifications.

In accordance with FAR 19.5, this acquisition is a 100% Small Business set-aside under NACIS code 337215 – Showcase, Partition, Shelving, and Locker Manufacturing, whose small business size standard is 500 employees.  As stated, this competition is 100% set-aside for the exclusive participation of Small Business. However, if you are a large business, and believe you can meet the requirement, you are invited to submit a statement of capability with associated product literature. This will help NAVAIR understand the current industry base, and will facilitate consideration of your product or service should the requirement not be met by the small business community.

This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included herein. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The provisions at FAR 52.212-1 and 212-2 apply.

Contractors should be prepared to take measurements of the rooms where the storage systems will be located.  All measurements listed below in Attachments 1 and 2 are approximate, but the intention is that the contractor adhere to the measurements as closely as possible and to provide high density storage system that accommodates the space constraints and technical requirements for these areas.  Following the visit/walk through, we may adjourn to a conference room for a question and answer session.

These four Engineering/Manufacturing Development (EMD) terminals have been used by AFRL and various customers to test and evaluate the features and capabilities of Link-16 terminals and the ability of other terminals to operate concurrently with Link-16 terminals.  Due to the need for a timely repair of the terminals, a sole source award is needed to ensure a quick repair.  Through time and use, the terminals are in a need of repair and update of software drivers to stay current with fielded Link-16 terminals.  The terminals have been evaluated and needed repairs are as follows based on serial number: SN 0611 – Update Receiver Transmitter Interface (RTI), Internal Power Supply (IPS), Remote Power Supply (RPS) & Signal Message Processor (SMP) SN 0612 – Update RTI, IPS, RPS, replace SMP, replace chassis and harness
SN 0613 – Replace exciter, update RTI, IPS, & Multiplexer (MUX), repair/update Primary Signal Message Processor (PSMP) SN 0020 – Update RTI, IPS & MUX, repair/update PSMP, replace chassis & harness.  This effort is expected to be completed in 1 month and Data Items will be required to be delivered as per the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs).  All software items developed and purchased on the FDL program shall be delivered to the Government upon completion of the program.  All hardware developed and purchased on the FDL program shall be delivered to the Government upon completion of the program.  No technical orders or repair manuals are available to add in repair on the terminals.  It is expected this repair should cost no more than $180,000.  Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Responses must be submitted to Melinda K Dawes, Contract Negotiator, via email at melinda.dawes@wpafb.af.mil.   Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis citing 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) with Winslow Raft Company which is located in Lake Suzy, Florida. This requirement is for Near Shore Life Rafts. Specifications; (1) NOAA needs to acquire light-weight durable 4-person capacity aviation life rafts to be used aboard small airplanes and helicopters as part of the aviation life support equipment required by NOAA’s new aviation safety policy. (2) These rafts must be packed in such a way as to be extremely durable and capable of being handled roughly with other scientific and safety equipment being loaded and unloaded from a variety of aircraft in the field environment.  (3) In addition to durability, the rafts must be packed to extend the inspection cycle to 3 year intervals to reduce the overall cost of inspection and provide more continuous service. This notice of intent is to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Winslow Raft Company.  Winslow Raft Company is the standardization of equipment with existing rafts purchased for use on NOAA aircraft.  In addition, Research conducted by Equipped to Survive, and independent reviewer of safety equipment reports, Winslow life rafts are superior to all others for general aviation use. In addition, no one offers buyers more options to customize the life rafts or survival kits to fit their own needs. No other life raft company vacuum packs life rafts to extend the inspection cycle from 1 to 3 years.  The Pelican hard cases needed for the Life Rafts are part of Winslow customizing the survival kit to fit NOAA’s needs. The Pelican cases purchased separately would cost $180/case.  This is a 12 month base period Contract.  This acquisition is being issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 6.3 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  RFQ: NAAN0040600033 is being issued with the notice: 52.213-4 and 52.204-7.  The NAICS code is 419170. Interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  In response, you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  The solicitation for this requirement will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 13 procedures.  Responses may be e-mailed to Leila.Harrington@noaa.gov no later than May 2, 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

In performing this follow-on project, the contractor will create an open systems design for transmitting E9-1-1 calls from most types of communications devices, will demonstrate a working proof of concept showing coordinated performance among the system’s components, and will prepare a plan for transitioning from disparate 9-1-1 systems to an IP environment in a national next generation system (or “system of systems”).   For this follow-on project, the FHWA plans to award one and only one cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, which will have a two-year Period of Performance and NO task orders.   The INCUMBENT contractor is the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), located at Suite 750, 4350 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1695.  Under that incumbent contract, numbered DTFH61-02-C-00015 and entitled “Facilitating the Implementation of Emergency Wireless Communications”, NENA, since October of 2001, has been working toward a goal of developing the necessary tools, technical guidance, and training and outreach materials to facilitate implementation of wireless E9-1-1 services throughout the 50 states.  However, the follow-on project synopsized here is MORE than just a simple CONTINUATION of the work done by NENA and should be considered separate and distinct form the work completed by NENA.  For example, the key operational capabilities of the NG9-1-1 system that will be developed under this FOLLOW-ON project will enable E9-1-1 calls from any networked communication device, as well as geographic-independent call access, transfer, and backup among Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) and between PSAPs and other authorized emergency organizations.  The systems architecture specifications that will be developed in this FOLLOW-ON project will require the 9-1-1 system to transition from analog to digital and from landline to Internet-based Protocols.   In short, in this FOLLOW-ON project a fundamental reexamination of the technological approach to 9-1-1 is required for the public safety emergency network adaptations to accommodate the challenges of wireless communications.   NENA IS eligible to COMPETE for the follow-on project announced in this Pre-Solicitation Notice.  NENA’s point of contact is Mr. Robert Cobb, who can be reached at the following e-mail address: bcobb@nena.org.  Although telephone numbers for NENA and for Mr. Cobb are obtainable on the Internet, prospective offerors for this follow-on project who wish to contact NENA are asked to use Mr. Cobb’s e-mail address rather than calling him.  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for copies of NENA’s INCUMBENT contract document are unlikely to be fruitful for organizations wishing to compete for this FOLLOW-ON project, for the following reasons:  (a) the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) routinely REDACTS, from contract documents furnished to FOIA requesters, all pricing data and all staffing data; (b) the Statement of Work that will be published hereafter in the Solicitation (RFP) for this FOLLOW-ON project will be self-contained and will stand alone and will DIFFER in many crucial respects from the Statement of Work set forth in NENA’s INCUMBENT contract document; (c) any attempt, by an offeror submitting a proposal for this follow-on project, to respond to the INCUMBENT contract’s Statement of Work would almost certainly call into serious question the offeror’s grasp of, and commitment to attaining, the technical objectives of this follow-on project; and (d) given the time-consuming procedure governing the FHWA’s processing of FOIA requests, it is unlikely that even an extensively redacted and probably useless copy of NENA’s INCUMBENT contract document could be made available to any FOIA requester before the due date for submitting PROPOSALS under this follow-on procurement.  The contractor performing this follow-on project will develop technical specifications and a transition plan for implementing a nationwide NG9-1-1 system.  Using a systems engineering approach, the contractor for this follow-on project will develop and validate requirements for the NG9-1-1 system, will define a system architecture, and will demonstrate a proof-of-concept prototype.  The contractor for this follow-on project will evaluate the system to determine how it supports emergency call initiation, routing, and processing that will ultimately fulfill public safety emergency response information needs.  In parallel to the engineering and test phases, the contractor for this follow-on project will develop an operationally and institutionally feasible transition plan for migrating today’s 9-1-1 system to a nationwide internetwork capable of managing emergency calls from most types of communications devices.  Production system deployment is NOT expected within this follow-on project.  It is estimated that the performance of this two-year follow-on project will require a total of 837 labor-hours to be worked by ONE Program Manager, who must be NAMED in each offeror’s INITIALLY-submitted written proposal for this follow-on project.  The Program Manager SHALL possess a technical degree and at least 15 years of experience in the research, development and application of emergency communications technologies, and shall possess at least five years of experience in managing a group of engineers in this field; but that five years of managerial experience could overlap with, or be contained within, the 15 years of research and development experience.  The Program Manager SHALL possess skills and knowledge that include systems engineering and integration, state/local 9-1-1 operations, emergency response operations, traditional 9-1-1 network technology and services, IP-network technology and operations, traditional telecommunications services, other IT / telecommunication application services, and IP-network access infrastructure and services.  It is further estimated that this follow-on project will require a total of 1,988 labor-hours to be worked by ONE Project Leader, who must be NAMED in an offeror’s INITIALLY-submitted written proposal for this follow-on project.  The Project Leader must have a degree, but a non-technical degree (e.g., a J. D. or a B. A. or a B. S. or an MBA) could substitute for a technical degree.  The Project Leader’s background shall be similar to that of the Program Manager, except that the Project Leader must possess a minimum of only seven years of experience in the research, development and application of emergency communications technologies, and the Project Leader must possess a minimum of only two years of experience in managing a group of engineers in this field.  It is also estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 6,030 labor-hours to be worked by MORE than one individual serving in Senior Level Staff positions.  Each particular Senior Level Staff person must be NAMED in an offeror’s INITIALLY-submitted written proposal for this follow-on project.  Each particular Senior Level Staff person shall possess five or more years of experience in systems engineering and integration, state / local 9-1-1 operations, emergency response operations, traditional 9-1-1 network technology and services, IP-network technology and operations, traditional telecommunications services, other IT / telecommunication application services, and IP-network access infrastructure and services, and shall have a technical degree, preferably related to one of the following disciplines:  systems engineering; electrical engineering; computer science; management information systems; or economics.  Additionally, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 9,460 labor-hours to be worked by MORE than one individual serving in Mid-Level Staff positions.  Each particular Mid-Level staff person SHALL possess two or more years of experience in technical areas related to NG9-1-1, and SHOULD have a related technical degree.  Also, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 8,430 labor-hours to be worked by MORE than one individual serving in Junior Level Staff positions.  Each particular Junior Level Staff person SHALL possess a degree relevant to transportation management or ITS and shall be capable of performing analyses, research, and the evaluation of technical products.  Finally, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 1,155 labor-hours for Administrative Support persons.   Each individual proposed as an Administrative Support Staff person shall have skills in word processing, graphical illustration, desktop publishing and mailing list software, and shall have the ability to turn products of technical staff into documents and presentations of specified formats and of high quality, including camera-ready copy for publications, and the ability to distribute such materials promptly to mailing lists of reviewers and participants.    Each proposed Administrative Support Staff member shall possess at least one year of work experience in rendering general office support, but such experience need not necessarily be in a transportation-related field.   Each proposed Administrative Support Staff member shall, at a minimum, possess an associate’s degree in any field, whether related to this 9-1-1 project or not.   THE DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA’S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS, AS PUBLISHED IN THIS PRE-S0LICITATION NOTICE, IS ONLY AN ESTIMATED DUE DATE.  THE ACTUAL DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA’S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WILL BE STATED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SOLICITATION (RFP) HEREAFTER PUBLISHED IN THIS SAME FedBizOpps WEBSITE.  The FHWA’s best current ESTIMATE is that the Solicitation MIGHT be published in this FedBizOpps website on or about May 19, 2006.

<DESC>Resistance and Powering Department, Code 5200, of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has been tasked to provide engineering services to research and collaboration of work on enhancing FOURIER-KOCHIN STEADY computer code predictions and methods to account for effects of sinkage and trim effects and to better satisfy the hull boundary condition. In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to George Mason University.   This is a follow-on effort to George Mason University. Professor Chi Yang of George Mason University has worked the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center previously on FOURIER-KOCHIN Steady (FKS) computer code predictions and methods. Methodology and estimation methods and tools are the result of this previous collaboration and continued collaboration to account for effects of sinkage and trim effects and to better satisfy the hull boundary condition', is considered to be the most cost effective and expeditions method to performing this effort.  This work is on the theoretical formulation of wave diffraction-radiation by a ship advancing in regular waves and is based on a Fourier representation of free-surface effects and an extension of Kochin's approach. Work previously done on the applications and extensions of the theory, to the coupling between an inner viscous flow and an outer potential flow and the representation of time-harmonic ship waves generated by an arbitrary singularity distribution will be expanded upon. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.   A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 5/4/2006.

<DESC>UPDATE TO VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (CRFI)

POSTED 30 JAN 06

ASSESSMENT VIRTUAL FEEDBACK SESSIONS

The Air Force has completed an assessment of responses to the Very Light Jet (VLJ) Capabilities Request for Information (CRFI) issued 30 Jan 2006.  Only companies that submitted a VLJ or related concept to the CRFI are invited to participate in a virtual feedback session to understand how the assessment was conducted and information regarding the assessment provided to the SECAF.  The feedback will also address the Air Force’s intent to monitor FAA certification progress of the VLJ class aircraft and, after certification, the Air Force will consider proceeding with flight evaluations. 

All VLJ CRFI respondents interested in participating in a feedback session must register No Later Than 12 May 06 by sending an email with the date of the preferred session to all the points of contact listed below.   A Meet-Me number and exact time of the feedback session will be emailed to all registered participants prior to the scheduled date.  Respondents will have the opportunity to choose one virtual information feedback session scheduled for the afternoon of 17 May and the morning of 23 May 2006. 

The Air Force will provide feedback on the overall assessment to all respondents.  All company proprietary caveats will be observed.  Several days prior to the selected virtual feedback session, the AF will email PowerPoint charts to each respondent for the overall Air Force assessment and the assessment of the capability of their company identified aircraft.  After each respondent has received the charts, the Air Force will accept questions via e-mail. General questions will be addressed  at the virtual session and specific assessment result questions for an aircraft will be discussed off-line with each respondent. 

Technical points of contact for the VLJ CRFI are Trixie Brewer, 937-255-7210 ext 3669 at trixie.brewer@wpafb.af.mil and Eric Crawford, 937-255-7210 ext 3568, at eric.crawford@wpafb.af.mil.  Contracting point of contact is Noelle Spalding, Contract Negotiator, 937-255-7210 ext 3108, noelle.spalding@wpafb.af.mil.    

This notice may be updated as additional information becomes available. 

****************************************************************

VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 1. This is a special notice requesting information to help the U.S. Air  Force examine potential capabilities and military uses of an emerging  aircraft class called Very Light Jet (VLJ). This class is generally  defined  by a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) no greater than 10,000 lb,  powered by one or two gas turbine engines (turbofan or turbojet), and a  commercial list price of much less than $5M per aircraft. 2. The Air Force is requesting information from appropriate companies or  parties currently developing VLJ aircraft on a) the capabilities of their  VLJ aircraft and b) the companies’ interest in supporting limited  qualitative evaluations of their VLJ aircraft by fully qualified Air Force  test pilots from the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) to be conducted  preferably by the end of CY2006. These qualitative flight evaluations or  ‘qual evals’ will assist the Air Force in examining military missions this  class of aircraft may be suited to perform. The Air Force desires to  perform these qual evals at either Edwards AFB, CA or at a location of the  interested party’s selection. The intent of the qual evals is to  investigate VLJ aircraft characteristics for potential AF missions and  will not require any permanent modification or change to the aircraft.  Broad industry participation in the VLJ RFI is encouraged, and VLJ designs  that are not mature enough for qual evals in 2006 are still acceptable.  During the initial information gathering of this VLJ RFI, request  companies planning to provide a capability response identify, to the Air  Force point of contact (POC) named below, the name of your company,  address, telephone number, and name and position in the company of the  individual to contact for future dialog. 3.  The Air Force is interested in assessing military utility for specific  missions that the VLJ class may be suited to perform including  passenger/cargo transport, navigation training, transition training,  Homeland Defense, surveillance, and target tow. Industry responses should  rank order the missions their VLJ may be best suited to perform, with  strengths and weaknesses of each mission discussed in two pages or less  per mission. However, as this is probably not an exhaustive list, the Air  Force requests identification of any additional missions that industry  believes this class of aircraft could perform. 4.  Finally, the Air Force is interested in obtaining current and accurate  information for each VLJ vehicle to include the characteristic data noted  in the Table below (this table is also posted to the PIXS library located  at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/default.asp).  Technical parameters,  likely concepts-of-operation, mission performance assessment results, and  price will all be considered during this AF VLJ capability assessment.  Responses are limited to:  a) a cover page, (including a name and telephone number of a technical  point of contact (if different from the contact information identified  above) having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses to  government representatives, a statement indicating if the company would  support a qualitative flight evaluation (either at Edwards AFB, CA or at  the location of the company’s choice), and a brief discussion of any costs  and/or liabilities that need addressed by the parties; b) up to ten pages for aircraft description, including technical and  general data summarized in the table below and descriptive text to provide  additional detail; and c) up to two pages for each viable mission. Participants will be provided the Air Force assessment of the capability  of their respective aircraft. 5.  This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For  Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to  award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any  information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does  not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to  otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost  under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent  Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation.  No responses received will be used as a proposal. 6. Further AF interest in VLJ will be dependent on the results of the RFI  capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and Air  Force operational requirements analyses and determinations. Potentially,  future leasing or purchasing agreements may be sought to obtain aircraft  in order to temporarily or permanently modify them with mission and/or  instrumentation equipment for more extensive evaluation. These more  comprehensive flight evaluations would most likely be conducted following  FAA type certification of the specific aircraft under evaluation;  consequently, timing will also be dependent on certification status. 7. Companies are not limited to a single aircraft configuration for this  RFI; however, each VLJ aircraft configuration must be clearly identified  in a separate narrative summary.  Request that the narrative summaries  discuss specific aircraft information delineated above in paragraph 2.  Submissions are requested within 30 days of this announcement and may be  made by e-mail or mailing your response on a floppy disk (or compact disk)  to:             Ms. Noelle Spalding, (937) 255-7210 ext 3108             Contract Negotiator             Noelle.spalding@wpafb.af.mil             ASC/AASS/PK (Bldg 28, Rm 219, 2145 Monahan Way)             Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433-7017 With a notice of delivery to:   Mrs. Pat Krabacher, (937) 904-4501                                                 Contracting Officer                                                 patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil                                                 ASC/XRS (Capability  Planning Div, 2275 D St., Bldg 16, RM 053)                                                 Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433-7217 Personnel hand-carrying responses should contact the Contract Negotiator  to arrange a likely arrival time. 8. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process  for obtaining the latest information on the “art of the possible” from  industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The  information collected may be used by the Government to explore future  strategies for the possible uses of VLJs within the military.  Information  received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and  will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained  in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information  received in response to this request will be properly protected from any  unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use proprietary  information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and  requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not  inadvertently restrict competition. 9. U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this VLJ capability  RFI.  Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly  answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some  release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a  question peculiar to a Company or that Company’s response.  Currently  one-on-one information gathering sessions with respondents are not  contemplated.  If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are  conducted, they will be offered to all to clarify understanding of the  submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss the form of  agreement to cover any Qual Evals.  Information feedback sessions may be  offered to respondents after all qualitative assessments are completed. 10.  Technical point of contact is Ms.Trixie Brewer, ASC/XRC Bldg 28,  (937)-255-7210, ext. 3669, or Mr. Eric Crawford, ASC/XRC Bldg 28,  (937)-255-7210, ext. 3568. 11.

<DESC>Radiographic Imaging System

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding radiographic imaging systems. CBP is looking for new, innovative technical approaches to radiographic imaging systems for screening of every passenger vehicle referred to secondary inspection at land border ports of entry (POE).  CBP wishes to improve the safety (for officers and the public), effectiveness, and speed of secondary inspections for illegal aliens, contraband, and terrorist weapons and materials.  CBP seeks a system small enough to fit within existing POE layouts, and fast enough to produce minimal impact to vehicle throughput.  Critical system attributes being sought are low cost, low radiation dose for passengers (less than 10 microrem per scan), small physical size, high reliability, high scan rate, and high quality imaging.  CBP also wishes to safely operate the system without a surrounding exclusion zone.  The system shall be capable of properly imaging all traffic that moves through CBP's land border ports of entry, with the exception of commercial trucks. This will include, but not be limited to, autos, pickup trucks, autos and pick up trucks towing trailers and boats, RV's and RV's towing autos and pick up trucks, delivery trucks, and any other specialty trucks, vans, SUV's, commercial buses and motorcycles.  Proposed systems must be commercial off the shelf (COTS) equipment and will initially be used in a pilot study.  CBP is not soliciting recommendations for research and development projects.  Responses received in response to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responders should review the complete RFI package for the details and requirements for responding to the RFI. Interested parties should provide a written expression of interest, an innovative, detailed technical approach, and an estimated cost (for budgetary planning purposes). Firms who wish to respond to this RFI should also include their business size, Dun and Bradstreet Number, GSA Schedule number should they hold one.

Additional or supplemental hard copy materials may also be submitted to the Office of Finance/Procurement, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Suite 1310 NP, Washington DC, 20229, ATTN: Terence Lew, Contracting Officer. All packages submitted electronically or by electronic media shall be free of any computer virus. If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed and a replacement provided within 3 days after notification. This office must receive responses to this RFI no later than May 9, 2006. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A NOTICE OF INVITATION FOR BID  (IFB) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). AT THIS TIME, NO SOLICITATION EXISTS. DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of contractor’s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.

<DESC>The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for using electronic books to replace paper-based course materials.  This will require an integrated solution of hardware, content conversion and distribution software, as well as installation, maintenance, and training for the solution architecture.  The goal of this effort is to determine the availability of such products and services leading to a solution that will reduce printing and student material costs as well as reducing the environmental impact of AETC operations.

This RFI is an attempt to locate businesses EXPERIENCED in providing end-to-end solutions of both electronic books and the required hardware and software to utilize them. This RFI is not to be construed as a formal solicitation nor does it constitute a current or any future Government requirement.

Course materials are developed and maintained using Microsoft Office products such as Word and PowerPoint, as well as Aldus PageMaker, Quark, Acrobat, and HTML.  The solution offered must include a network-capable reader offering note taking, highlighting, and printing, a web-based content management application, conversion software, training, and technical support for instructional design staff and end-user instructors.  All distribution servers, content conversion software, course content, and any other software required to provide electronic versions of course documents must remain in the possession of the Air Force.  Outsourcing distribution or conversion services to a vendor is not contemplated for the purpose of this RFI.
Small Business Set-Aside:  The Government reserves the right to consider a small or small disadvantaged business set aside based on responses to this notice.  For purposes of this acquisition, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541611, Educational Support Services, will be used for this acquisition.  The business size standard is $6M.  ALL types of small business entities are encouraged to submit a response.  Prospective Offerors must have the financial backing to defray operating costs for approximately sixty (60) to ninety (90) days.  Registration in the Central Contract Registration (CCR) located at www.ccr.gov is mandatory.  PLEASE IDENTIFY SIZE STANDARD IN THIS RFI SO YOU CAN APPROPRIATELY REPRESENT YOURSELF AS SMALL OR LARGE. NOTE:  Dates appearing in the notification are subject to change.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) is conducting market research to identify potential SBA-certified 8(a) contractors capable of providing support for the Climate Protection Partnerships Division?s (CPPD?s) ENERGY STAR?  hotline and distribution center in anticipation of awarding a competitive 8(a) set-aside three-year (one-year base and two one-year options) fixed-price contract. ENERGY STAR is a voluntary program which helps consumers and businesses save energy and money by promoting the use of energy-efficient products and services to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. The hotline and distribution center currently receives about 1,000 calls and 300 e-mails per month, and requires storage for up to 200,000 documents annually. The hotline operates 8:30 am - 5:00 pm ET, Monday through Friday. The contractor shall provide the facility to house the hotline and distribution center where the existing telephone number, 1-888-STAR-YES, can be maintained. EPA?s goal is to reduce the call volume by 25-50%, by driving these calls and e-mails to the ENERGY STAR website to access pertinent information. Interested parties must submit the following information by May 10, 2006 to Jami Rodgers at rodgers.jami@epa.gov for inclusion on the potential source list: (a) Name of vendor; (b) Contact information (address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail); (c) Applicable business classifications (certified 8(a), HUBZone, woman-owned, service-disabled veteran, Native American, etc); and (d) a capabilities statement.  As EPA is most interested in information related to innovation in the hotline industry, the capabilities statement must address: (1) how hotlines are using the Internet to answer questions and methods used to shift traditional calls and e-mails for information to an established website with relevant information already in the public domain; (2) how hotlines use technology to track the content of the calls, and how this information is used for improvements to website materials; (3) the availability and use of commercial off-the-shelf software for hotlines to track calls and provide reports;  (4) any new methods to structure hotline contracts so that firms are motivated to reduce call volume (assuming the website is servicing these eliminated callers) and rewarded for improving customer service, and not just answering more calls/e-mails; and (5) how hotlines keep staff up-to-date on constantly changing program information and how the Government burden for providing training on updated information is minimized.  The EPA does not want full-scale proposals. Please limit responses to ten (10) pages, single-spaced, size 12 font and only provide the information requested in this paragraph. Please note that this IS NOT a solicitation for proposals; no contract will be awarded as the result of this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any subsequent information requests. Given the potential volume of responses, no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their individual capabilities statement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is considering replacement of our Xerox 4890 printer and is seeking information on new technology which will meet our printing requirements.  Our requirements are:  Printer must support a monthly workload which varies from a low of 50,000 pages to a high of 240,000 with a mean just below 100,000. The largest single monthly print job is 17,000 pages. The current printer does this job in 3 ½ hours (about 90 ppm). This print job cannot take longer than an 8-hour shift.  Print quality must support scannible bar codes (300dpi or better). One color (in addition to black) is used to separate instructions from the reporter’s response from last month. The print operator needs to be able to start, stop, and restart print jobs as well as control priorities and print order.

The printer must have network connectivity. BLS uses an Ethernet network and runs Windows 2003 servers. The printer must have the ability to disable any unnecessary services, including FTP, SNMP, HTTP, TELNET, and IPP.   Not having this ability will disqualify a proposed print solution.

The survey supported by this printer is under severe scheduling constrains. If the printer stops for any reason, on site technical support is required within 2 hours, five days a week. The schedule for the big print jobs is known in advance so preventative or preparation maintenance can be accomplished. If the replacement printer requires more than 6 hours for the largest print job, quicker maintenance response may be required.

The printer is in a raised floor, HVAC and humidity controlled environment. Power is available in 110 or 220 as required by the replacement printer.

Companies who can meet our requirements should submit specifications and brochures to:     
         Bureau of Labor Statistics
         ATTN:  Judith Silver, Room 1830
         2 Massachusetts Ave, N.E.
         Washington, DC 20212

Commercial price lists would also be welcome. All information must be submitted NLT February 24, 2006.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, ONLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Once the final requirement is established a Request for Proposal will be issued.

<DESC>Remote Armament Market Survey The US ARMY ARDEC, Armored Vehicle Fire Control & Future Combat Systems  Division, Picatinny NJ is seeking information on state of the art,  lightweight, sight / sensor / controller / display systems for  utilization on remotely operated, robotic, ground based, lethality  armament systems equipped with 7.62mm or .50 caliber automatic weapons. Operators in control of these systems may be either on board or  separated from the armament system platform.  These armament systems are intended to acquire and engage targets at ranges from 25 meters to  beyond 1500 meters.  Target acquisition and situational awareness  capability at ranges up to and beyond 2000 meters is also desirable.  Systems of interest would consist of an assembly comprised of one or  more Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) that includes multi field-of-view  sights (both thermal and color daylight), an eye safe laser rangefinder, and visual and infra-red aiming lasers, with a means for stabilizing and directing the lines of sight of these components in azimuth and  elevation, as well as real time stabilization of the video image to  reject high frequency disturbances.  Of greater interest would be systems that, in addition to the above components, have an operator display and control panel, a processor capable of performing ballistic computations, and an interface for communicating with other on board systems.   Additionally, systems with secure radio frequency communications (as well as cable based communications) to support robotic armament system  operation, and those that address the inherent safety issues related to  robotic lethality, are also of very high interest.  Firms / companies are  invited to provide brochures, specifications, manuals, reports,  demonstration video, or other technical data which describes the  operation and performance of their system.  A timeframe for the systemâ€™s availability, a rough indication of pricing for a single unit, as well  as, identification of existing users of the system should also be  furnished. Firms / companies should provide the requested information by May 31,  2006 to the US Army ARDEC, ATTN:  Travis James, AMSTA-AQ-APD, Bldg. 10  Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000, email travis.james3@pica.army.mil, Phone (973)  724-4591.  When submitting replies, please include the name and address  of the firm, point of contact with telephone number and email address,  size of business (small / large), and country represented.  This is a  market survey for information only and shall not be construed as a  request for a proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US  Government.  The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<SUBJECT>A--PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MARS GRACE MISSION
<DESC>The MarsGRACE Mission aims at translating the success of GRACE mission from Earth to the purpose of mapping mass flux on Mars. The seasonal time-variations as well the mean gravity field of Mars are of great interest, and address several high priority Mars Exploration Program goals. The seasonal variability of Mars gravity field is due to the changing polar ice cap and atmospheric pressure variations. The principal objective of the MarsGRACE  is to use precise distance change measurements between two identical, co-orbiting spacecrafts to extract accurate maps of Mars gravity field changes due to climatic processes. Global coverage of Mars is expected for a period of two Martian years.	Additional necessary measurements include non-gravitational accelerations using an electrostatic accelerometer; inertial attitude using precise star cameras; and precise tracking to Earth in order to compute the orbits and time.  Further information about the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), a joint NASA/DLR mission to map Earth gravity field, may be found at http://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace. Potential partners are asked to contact the MarsGRACE team within one week after release of this document.  This contact will serve to help the team disseminate all relevant information to potential partners.  Potential partners should ask questions during the first week after release of this document.  All questions and answers will be sent to those who express a desire to respond, while the source of the questions shall be held confidential.

<SUBJECT>B -- Subsistence Global Capability Information
<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) would like to purchase information regarding available commercial assets and capability within a region or country to supply, store, transport and/or assemble DLA commodity components for military and other contingency/emergency operations.  This information will be purchased under the Industrial Base extension (IBex) Program.  IBex was developed as an Industrial Preparedness Measure (IPM) to gain commercial asset visibility over global capability available to support US Military operations and natural disasters with possible access to these capabilities if required.  The primary users of this information are DLA Contingency Planners, US Military Planners and other government agency planners.  The information will be used to evaluate logistic support options.  Capability reports and information purchased will be used to develop sourcing strategy solutions that include contingency plans to assure warfighter surge and sustainment support.  Information will also be used to develop industrial base solutions/investments as appropriate.  The five elements of the IBex Program are (1) Contingency Management Reports in the form of Written Report and Requests for Information, (2) Support Planning Integrated Data Enterprise System (SPIDERS) Data Entry, (3) Contingency Support Supplies and Services, (4) Verification/Testing, (5) Process Review Meeting Participation.   Contingency Management reports will typically include details for a particular country or region, such as an analysis of logistic services, estimated costs, and specific transportation, warehouse and labor availability.  SPIDERS is DLA’s web based industrial capability data collection tool.  All information purchased must be entered into this system.  Contingency Support Supplies and Services is a back-up to established sources of supplies and services.  Verification and Testing may include any methodology that can validate the contractor’s capability.  IBex vendors will be expected to participate in annual government/industry process review meetings at their own expense.
 Interested vendors will be evaluated by the Industrial Based Program Manager.  Only those vendors who are determined to add value to the program will be offered an agreement. The agreement will be in the form of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).   The IBex BPA will include detailed requirements.

<SUBJECT>R -- Multifamily Property Management and Relocation Services
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.



The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is soliciting comments, suggestions and industry feedback regarding the Office of Multifamily Property Management & Relocation Services requirement. This requirement will combine property management and relocation services into one contract, which HUD has previously awarded as separate contracts. HUD intends to satisfy its requirements through the use of performance-based acquisition methodology. In addition to the attached Statement of Objectives (SOO), a Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) must be developed by the offerors. The PRS must describe: 1) the end results to be achieved; 2) the performance standards and acceptable quality levels of the work performed; 3) a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) to assure that the end results meet quality and acceptability levels; and 4) an incentive/disincentive structure, which rewards the contractor for exceeding HUD’s stated objectives and sets forth remedies for reductions in price when the contractor does not meet HUD’s stated objectives. Ordinarily, the Government would create the PRS; however, it is HUD’s belief that industry would produce a PRS that would motivate optimum performance. Therefore, the resultant solicitation that HUD anticipates releasing this fiscal year will require that offerors propose the PRS. It is anticipated that this requirement will result in a competitive procurement under the 8(A) program.

  

HUD welcomes all questions, concerns, clarifications and any other input that would assist in developing this requirement using performance-based acquisition methodology. Industry input is sought in order to make the SOO as complete, accurate, understandable and achievable as possible.  

  

The following documents are provided for industry review and comments: draft SOO, process flow charts for property management and relocation services, and relevant historical data on property management and relocation services. Please review the aforementioned documents and submit all comments, suggestions and feedback to the following address: mfh_soo@hud.gov, by Wednesday, May 17, 2006.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to negotiate on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the American Medical Association (AMA), 515 N. State Street Chicago, IL for the development of an on-line on-demand interactive continuing Education Program based on the Diagnosis and Management of Foodborne Illness:  A Primer for Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals. Work Description: AMA shall develop and implement an online, on-demand interactive continuing medical education program based on the “Diagnosis and Management of Foodborne Illnesses: A Primer for Physicians and Other Health care Professionals.  The program will comprise about 150 HTML web-based pages which will include a 60 item assessment and feature highlights such as text-based presentation of instruction, graphical effects, sophisticated navigation, single session user tracking and bookmarking, and course launching and tracking. Foodborne illness is a serious public health problem. Web-based educational programs are being used by increasing numbers of physicians and health care professionals because of the timeliness of the medical information and because of the ease of access to key medical information accommodating their busy hospital and medical practice demands. By developing the Primer as an online interactive continuing medical education program it will ensure that the existing information in the Primer web-based program is current and up-to-date; will provide unique graphics and learning modules to compliment the educational purpose on foodborne illness of the website.  It will also facilitate maintaining and updating the Continuing Medical Education credits process awarded for this program. The Primer utilizes presentations of clinical scenarios and clinical vignettes on different foodborne pathogens.  It also includes information on: clinical considerations, tables on foodborne illnesses with summaries of clinical and diagnostic considerations, laboratory tests, and recommended treatment of bacterial, viral, parasitic, and non infectious causes of foodborne illnesses, current suggested food safety resources and reading list.  The Primer also contains concise patient information for physicians to distribute information. Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Continuing Education (CE) credits were also offered. The American Medical Association (AMA) is the preeminent national organization for US physicians promoting the art and science of medicine for the betterment of the public health.  The AMA was the driving force for the development of the Primer with the goal of providing educational materials to the US physicians on the diagnosis, management and most importantly the prevention of foodborne illnesses.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the FDA.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor is an RFP available.  All questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Patricia Pemberton Contract Specialist at patricia.pemberton@fda.hhs.gov     See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast ac cess identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.

If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee. If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contract or employee. If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however,if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access  identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.c. If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason,the contractor shall immediately  notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day. An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall no t be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.d.Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.If an employees identification badge is lost, s tolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.e.Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.

<CONTACT>Noel Willette, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-446-4520, Fax 215-446-6123, Email noel.willette@gsa.gov
<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) intends to procure a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the Window Sill Replacement at the Norfolk Federal Building. It is GSA's intent to solicit this requirement through a small business set-aside, utilizing Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Source Selection procedures. The LPTA method, FAR 15.101-2, has been determined by the GSA Project Team to be in the best interests of the Government. The NAICS for this procurement is code 238350.The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract. The work includes but is not limited to the removal of both the interior and exterior trim pieces along with the windows and frames in order to install a sill pan. As part of the contract requirements the contractor shall take digital photos of the entire window sill after window removal and prior to re-installing the windows. These photos will be used to document the conditions and be used by the inspection agent to insure compliance with the installation details and for quality assurance. The attached elevations represent the building views and identify pan sills that are to be replaced. The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining a weather barrier as windows are removed and replaced. Any windows that will remain out overnight shall have the openings temporary secured using plywood (or suitable substitute) with a weather barrier. Upon reinstalling of windows they shall be immediately cleaned inside and out using approved cleaning products. For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, “Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process”. As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability; 1.) Firm lists a minimum of three (3) projects completed in the past ten (10) years of a similar scope of work that have a total construction value of at least $500,000.00. Two of the three projects must have been completed in an occupied building. 2) Superintendent shall submit resume demonstrating that he/she has 10 years of experience as a superintendent. Since the Contracting Officer has elected to utilize past performance as an evaluation factor the procedures detailed in FAR 15.305, “Proposal evaluation”, shall be followed. All proposals received shall be evaluated for acceptability but shall not be ranked using non-cost/ price factors. The RFP is available. The subject solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified Building Information (SBU). For reasons of security and before release of SBU information, the requestor must complete and sign a "Document Security Notice to Prospective Bidders/Offerors" included in this notice. All prime contractors interested in submitting a proposal shall submit via facsimile or e-mail a completed document security form downloadable from this site. As indicated, the form shall be filled out with the proper information including a photocopy of a valid business license, DUNS number, and IRS tax ID number. This information shall be emailed to the attention of the Melinda M. Richardson at melinda.richardson@gsa.gov. Once this information is received and verified, direction will be provided as to where the RFP, including plans and specifications, will be available. A Pre-proposal conference will held on Thursday May 4 at 10:00 in Room 239 at the Norfolk Federal Building. To insure that you receive all information regarding this solicitation, please register to receive updates at www.fedbizopps.gov, follow the procedures for notification registration.

<CONTACT>Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Fax null, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions from industry regarding clarifications of the requirements as follows:

1) Question -- The laser wavelength for Raman analysis is not given.  Are multiple excitation wavelengths being considered?  Is there a preferred wavelength that was omitted from the specifications?

Answer -- There is no preferred wavelength, and multiple wavelengths are acceptable.

2)  Question -- The solicitation includes the following requirement -- Fluorescence suppression for Raman analysis -- Are UV laser wavelengths acceptable for fluorescence suppression?  Do you mean (A) mathematical manipulation such as baseline or spectral subtraction to eliminate the appearance of fluorescence, or (B) a physical method of fluorescence suppression such as fluorescence quenching or choice of UV excitation to eliminate fluorescence from the Raman region of the spectrum? 

Answer -- Any viable method for fluorescence suppression is acceptable, as long as the measurement specification is met.

3)  Question -- The solicitation includes the following requirement -- Multi-grating turret with at least three gratings -- is it an absolute requirement that the system have a turret-style grating holder or can other types of mounts that allow the use of 3 or more gratings be used?  How important is it to have multiple grating selection capabilities?

Answer -- Other multi-grating methods are acceptable.  The most important feature is the final measurement ability.  If this can be accomplished with fewer gratings, that would be acceptable.

4)  Question -- The solicitation includes the following requirement -- Motorized confocal pinhole -- Does this mean that the selection of confocal mode should be under complete computer control?  Is a pinhole required or can other methods used to achieve confocality be used?

Answer -- Alternate methods can be submitted for evaluation.

5)  Question -- Is confocal performance part of the evaluation for the test samples in specification #18? 

Answer -- No.

6)  Question -- The solicitation includes the following requirement -- The system shall also include the capability of conducting remote measurements using a fiber optic probe -- Are there any separate requirements for the fiber-optic probe or is it intended to match the performance for spatial resolution and confocality obtained with the microscope system?



Answer -- There are no separate requirements for the fiber-optic probe.

7)  Question -- The solicitation includes the following requirement -- Polarization filters -- What is your intended purpose of the polarization filters?  Does this refer to the optical microscope or is it a requirement for polarized Raman analysis?  Do you need to be able to change the polarization of the laser?

Answer -- The purpose of the polarization filters is to improve the image, not polarize the laser.

8) Question -- The solicitation includes the following requirement -- High spatial resolution -- Are the test samples in specification #18 designed to test these resolution claims?

Answer -- No.

9) Question -- The solicitation includes the following requirement -- High spectral resolution: 3 cm-1 or better -- How is spectral resolution being defined?

Answer -- Dispersion per pixel.

10) Question -- The solicitation includes the following requirement -- All interested Vendors shall request test samples from NIST to evaluate and to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of their measurement systems in detecting and identifying the substances on the test samples, and send written results to NIST with their quotation -- If the Vendor can demonstrate test data on listed samples, will that satisfy the requirements?  Is the vendor required to analyze all samples to satisfy the requirement set forth in this solicitation?

Answer -- Vendor needs to demonstrate the ability to accurately analyze the test samples provided by NIST, consisting of small copper coupons.

11)  All other terms of this solicitation remain unchanged.

<DESC>Create service openings in the system as necessary in order to accommodate cleaning of otherwise inaccessible areas. Mechanically clean all duct systems to remove all visible contaminants, such that the systems are capable of passing Cleaning Verification Testings (see NADCA Standards). Health and Safety Safety Standards:  Cleaning contractors shall comply with all appli cable federal, state, and local requirements for protecting the safety of the contractors' employees, building occupants, and the environment.  In particular, all applicable standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) shall be fol lowed when working in accordance with this specification. Occupant Safety:  No processes or materials shall be employed in such a manner that they will introduce additional hazards into occupied spaces. Disposal of Debris.  All Debris removed from the HVAC  System shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable federal, state and local requirements. Mechanical Cleaning Methodology Source Removal Cleaning Methods:  The HVAC system shall be cleaned using Source Removal mechanical cleaning methods designed t o extract contaminants from within the HVAC system and safely remove contaminants from the facility.  It is the contractors responsibility to select Source Removal methods which will render the HVAC system Visibly Clean and capable of passing cleaning ver ification methods (See applicable NADCA Standards) and other specified tests, in accordance with all general requirements.  No cleaning method, or combination of methods, shall be used which could potentially damage components of the HVAC system or negativ ely alter the integrity of the system. All methods used shall incorporate the use of vacuum collection devices that are operated continuously during cleaning.  A vacuum device shall be connected to the downstream end of the section being cleaned through a predetermined opening.  The vacuum collection device must be of sufficient power to render all areas being cleaned under negative pressure, such that containment of debris and the protection of the indoor environment is assured. All vacuum devices exhausti ng air inside the building shall be equipped with HEPA filters (minimum efficiency), including hand-held vacuums and wet-vacuums. All vacuum devices exhausting air outside the facility shall be equipped with Particulate Collection including adequate filtra tion to contain Debris removed from the HVAC system. Such devices shall exhaust in a manner that will not allow contaminants to re-enter the facility.  Release of debris outdoors must not violate any outdoor environmental standards, codes or regulations. A ll methods require mechanical agitation devices to dislodge debris adhered to interior HVAC system surfaces, such that debris may be safely conveyed to vacuum collection devices.  Acceptable methods will include those which will not potentially damage the integrity of the ductwork, nor damage porous surface materials such as liners inside the ductwork or system components.  Cleaning of coils: Any cleaning method may be used which will render the Coil Visibly Clean and capable of passing Coil Cleaning Verification (see applicable NADCA Standards).  Coil drain pans shall be subject to Non-Porous Surfaces Cleaning Verification.  The drain for the condensate drain pan shall be operational.  Cleaning methods shall not cause any appreciable damage to, displacement of, inhibit heat transfer, or erosion of the coil surface or fins, and shall conform to coil manufacturer recommendation s when available.  Coils shall be thoroughly rinsed with clean water to remove any latent residues.   Biocidal Agents and Coatings:Biocidal agents shall only be applied if active fungal growth is reasonably suspected, or where unacceptable levels of fungal contamination have been verified through testing. Application of any biocidal agents used to control the growth of fungal or bacteriological contaminants shall be perf ormed after the removal of surface deposits and debris. Only biocidal agents registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) specifically for use within HVAC system shall be used. Biocidal agents shall be applied in strict accordance with manu facturers instructions. Biocidal coating products for both porous and non-porous surfaces shall be EPA registered, water soluble solutions with supporting efficacy data and MSDS records. Biocidal coatings shall be applied according to manufacturers instr uctions. Coatings shall be sprayed directly onto interior ductwork surfaces, rather than fogged downstream onto surfaces.  A continuous film must be achieved on the surface to be treated by the coating application. Application of any biocidal coatings sh all be in strict accordance with manufacturers minimum millage surface application rate standards for effectiveness.  Cleanliness Verification General:  Verification of HVAC System cleanliness will be determined after mechanical cleaning and before the application of any treatment or introduction of any treatment-related substance to the HVAC system, including biocidal ag ents and coatings. Visual Inspection:  the HVAC system shall be inspected visually to ensure that no visible contaminants are present. If no contaminants are evident through visual inspection, the HVAC system shall be considered clean; however, the Governm ent reserves the right to further verify system cleanliness through gravimetric or wipe testing analysis testing as specified herein. If visible contaminants are evident through visual inspection, those portions of the system where contaminants are visible  shall be re-cleaned and subjected to re-inspection for cleanliness. Gravimetric Analysis:  At the discretion and expense of the Government, sections of the HVAC system may be tested for cleanliness using the NADCA Vacuum Test (gravimetric analysis) as spe cified in applicable NADCA Standards.  Levels of debris collected shall be equal to or less than acceptable levels defined in applicable NADCA Standards.  If gravimetric analysis determines that levels of debris are equal to or lower than those levels specified in applicable NADCA standards, the system shall be considered clean and shall have passed cleanliness verification.  If gravimetric analysis determines that levels of debris exceed those specified in applicable NADCA standards, the system shall not be considered clean and those sections of the system which failed cleanliness verification shall be re-cleaned at the expens e of the HVAC system cleaning contractor.  Gravimetric analysis shall be performed by a qualified third party experienced in testing of this nature.  Cleanliness verification shall be performed immediately after mechanical cleaning and before the HVAC system is restored to normal operation.  Verification of Coil Cleaning: Cleaning must restore the coil pressure drop to within 10 percent of the pressure drop measured when the coil was first installed.  If the original pressure drop is not known, the coil will be considered clean only if the coi l is free of foreign matter and chemical residue, based on a thorough visual inspection (see NADCA Standards).  Post-Project Report: At the conclusion of the project, the Contractor shall provide a report to the C.O.R. indicating the following: Success of the cleaning project, as verified through visual inspection and/or gravimetric analysis. Areas of the system fou nd to be damaged and/or in need of repair.
