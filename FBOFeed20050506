<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation No. DTRT57-05-Q-80127 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), and FAR Part 12, Commercial Item Procedures.  The NAICS Code is 541990 and the small business size standard is no more than $6.0 million dollars.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; competitive proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be  issued. The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), an agency of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), supports the modal administrations of the DOT through the conduct of engineering studies and research and development activities necessary to evaluate and improve transportation safety and performance.  The Volpe Center is providing analytical support on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) to provide evaluation and testing of the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) accuracy, availability, and integrity in maritime applications. The Volpe Center requires the services of a Contractor to perform data analysis and provide documentation related to its analysis and evaluation of the impact of WAAS on marine radio-navigatio n users. INTRODUCTION: The FAA has developed the WAAS for aviation use. WAAS is an extremely accurate navigation system developed for civil aviation. WAAS is capable of providing horizontal and vertical navigation for precision approach operations for all classes of aircraft in all flight navigations, including en route navigation, airport departures, and airport arrivals.  The WAAS achieved Initial Operation Capability (IOC) in July 2003. FAA testing of WAAS confirmed accuracy performance of 1-2 meters horizontal and 2-3 meters vertical throughout the majority of the continental United States and portions of Alaska. Increasing numbers of WAAS receivers have emerged in the public marketplace and are being used in maritime regions. As a result, comprehensive evaluation and testing of WAAS a ccuracy, availability, and integrity in maritime applications is required (e.g., buoy positioning, harbor entrance approach navigation, and inland waterway navigation). The evaluation and testing shall include an in-depth study of the differences between the performance parameter definitions and requirements for marine and aviation applications, a review of the existing model for WAAS coverage, adapting the concurrent or creating a new WAAS model(s) and then examining the performance of the model(s). The latter effort is expected to require collection of GPS and WAAS data from multiple sites within the United States. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this requirement is to determine whether the WAAS augmentation system satisfies the performance requirements for maritime navigation and positionin g applications. The evaluation shall be conducted using processes similar to those used to determine whether Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) meet these requirements and shall be supported by data collection efforts conducted in dynamic (navigation) as well as static (positioning) operations. The Contractor shall perform data analysis and provide documentation related to its analysis and evaluation of the impact of WAAS on marine radio-navigation users. TASKS: Task (1) Prepare Data Collection Technical Approach/Test Plan. The Contractor shall submit a technical approach and test plan for the data collection effort based on the receivers provided as Government-Furnished Property (GFP). The technical approach shall include the proposed method for determining ground-truth positi oning. This technical approach for data collection shall be briefed to the Volpe Center Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR). The Contractor shall prepare and submit the technical approach prior to proceeding with the WAAS data collection field efforts. Task (2) Data Collection. The Contractor shall support the Volpe Center in identifying analysis parameters and constraints related to the WAAS coverage and availability models developed by the Volpe Center. The Contractor will support the Volpe Center in validation of the Volpe-developed models by performing WAAS accuracy and integrity data gathering for five (5) key areas in the United States. Data shall be collected using various types of WAAS-enabled GPS receivers. The receivers and necessary computer data collection ass ets (i.e., 2U rack-mounted PCs) will be supplied by the Government as GFP. The Contractor shall locate the equipment in a mobile equipment rack to ensure easy transportation and reliable operation at the collection site. Data shall be taken over a continuous twenty-four (24) hour period at each location. Data collection shall be performed in and/or along the following harbors/waterways designated by the Volpe Center for both static and dynamic conditions, as agreed to in the approved test plan submitted under Task 1: 1) Bar Harbor, ME; 2) Galveston, TX; 3) San Diego, CA; 4) Seattle (Puget Sound), WA; and 5) Valdez, AK. For these efforts, the COTR will be responsible for establishing liaison with the host agencies to allow access to harbor or waterways designated by the Volpe Center. Additi onally, the COTR will establish liaison with U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel to allow access to USCG vessels for the harbor data collection efforts. Task (3) Monthly Project Status Reporting. The Contractor shall provide monthly project status reports describing accomplishments achieved during the previous month and planned activities for the upcoming month. The monthly project status reports shall provide schedule status and identify any risks to the successful completion of the project. Task (4) Final Report. The Contractor shall submit a final report to the Volpe Center summarizing the project findings. The final report shall be written in a professional format suitable for presentation at an Institute of Navigation Conference.

<DESC>United States Special Operations is seeking industry comments on a proposed strategy and draft Statement of Work (SOW) to acquire a production ready, SOF Deployable Node, Medium (SDN-M).  This announcement is a request for comment only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The RFP will posted on Fed Biz Ops and shall likely be designated as a small business set aside since the corresponding market investigation determined that multiple small businesses were capable of satisfying this requirement.  The NAICS Code is 334220. The primary objective of the SDN-M program is to leverage ongoing industry initiatives/commercial items in the area of Internet Protocol (IP) based SATCOM   technologies to satisfy SDN-M performance/operational requirements without a Government funded development program.  The SDN-M requirement is to procure up to 109 non-developmental, commercially available, transit case configured, Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) for satellite communications in the Ku frequency band. 

The basis for contract award shall be BEST VALUE, with evaluation factors consisting of technical, past performance and cost/price.  The technical evaluation will assess both the written proposal and an Initial Production System (IPS) demonstration at a Government designated facility.  The RFP will identify the IPS demonstration set-up, procedures, and performance parameters that will be assessed as part of Source Selection. Each offeror shall provide an operational IPS for evaluation comprised of their VSAT terminal (not exceeding 1 meter in aperture) and an integrated environmentally protected iDirect modem supporting Internet Protocol (IP) satellite transport.  In addition to shared resource IP-based communications such as hub-spoke Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) protocols, the integral modem shall provide a bypass mode supporting Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) functionality.  The purpose of the IPS demonstration is to assess the technical maturity of the product proposed and the realism of the offeror’s proposed schedule for delivery of production test articles.  The IPS must possess all of the required INTELSAT certifications prior to the IPS demonstration.  If the IPS does not include all the baseline performance parameters as described in the SOW, then the offeror shall explain in its technical proposal what additional effort is required to fully implement those parameter(s).  Additional capabilities exceeding the SDN-M baseline requirements that are proposed for delivery in the SDN-M first production units, must be included in the IPS demonstration.  Instructions will be provided in the RFP regarding the location and time of the IPS demonstration.  

The Government anticipates, upon conclusion of source selection, the award of a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five year hardware ordering period and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  The USSOCOM requirement is for up to 109 SDN-M production systems, training, and ancillary equipment and spares.   

Potential offerors are invited to review and comment on this strategy and the draft SOW within 15 days of this announcement.  The draft SOW is available electronically on the Fed Biz Ops Web Site.

<CONTACT>Terence Lew, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 344-1247, Fax (202) 344-1254, Email terence.lew@dhs.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is soliciting proposals for multiple-award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, non-developmental, fixed price, base year plus four optional years, commercial item contracts for imaging systems for Large Scale Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) equipment. The requirement will be for four (4) low-energy and high-energy system configurations (fixed, mobile, rail and pallet).  These imaging systems are for the detection of Weapons of Mass Destruction, explosives, conventional weapons, drugs, and other contraband, concealed in steel-walled tankers, tractor trailers, towed vehicles, cargo containers, automobiles, pick-up trucks, buses, towed trailers, railcars and large pallets.

Critical system attributes include: small as practicable physical size and weight, high operational reliability, high cargo and conveyance penetration, high quality imaging and low cost.

These systems will be deployed at land border crossings and at seaports. The fixed and mobile inspection systems shall be capable of inspecting the largest commercial vehicles that are allowed on the public roadways. The pallet inspection system shall be capable of inspecting large pallets up to 5,000 lbs.  The rail inspection systems are required to image railcars within the North American Train Bridge Envelope (double stacked cars, tri-level auto carriers, boxcars, tankers, spine cars, grain cars and tankers). The trains will be traveling in both northbound and southbound directions at constant speeds. Imaging systems must perform with no gaps, no missing sections, and no loss of image data. Operationally, the systems need to completely penetrate fully laden cargo in a single scan and provide high throughput.  

The operational environment for all NII imaging systems ranges from desert to arctic conditions that typically include temperatures between –20 degrees to + 120 degrees F and winds of up to 40 mph (125 mph rail only). The rail, fixed and mobile systems shall be capable of operating outdoors during a 24-hour day, and in a variety of climatic environments such as the hot arid desert, warm and humid coastlines and extreme cold northern borders of the United States. The pallet system shall be capable of operating on a loading dock or in a warehouse. All inspection systems shall be capable of a minimum of 16 consecutive operating hours daily.  All systems shall be capable of being operated by a two-person team.

As for radiation safety, identify the radiation safety control area for non-radiation workers at .05mR/hr above background. 

System resolution shall be 0.125 inches preferred but not less than 0.5 inch for mobile, fixed and pallet.  For rail only (one (1) inch resolution) at the systems maximum sustained throughput speed of 5-mph minimum up to 10-mph preferred (at track centerline). 

Penetration must be sufficient to see through cargo up to 8’ wide with densities up to 1g/cc.

Contrast sensitivity of at least 2% is desired throughout the penetration range and shall be quantified as it relates to speed (example: X % at Y mph or Y inch/sec). Image quality (resolution, contrast and penetration, etc.) shall be satisfied using high efficiency detectors and 16-bit minimum image processing technology.


CBP requires fully functional next generation production imaging inspection systems incorporating the latest technical advances. Of special interest is a built-in capability to passively detect (in a single pass) the presence of neutron and gamma radiation emissions.  Advanced “smart” signal processing to assist the operators in threat detection and identification is also of particular interest.

Offerors shall provide a production schedule with the initial delivery within five months after contract award and deliveries of one system each month thereafter.

CBP will evaluate image resolution, contrast sensitivity and penetration by use of Image quality penetrameters in accordance with American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standards for radiographic imaging.  

Offerors will be required to demonstrate the entire target vehicle being scanned in a single screen display.  In addition the offerors must provide examples of false color mapping of images using palettes.  Offerors must also demonstrate that the inspection systems meet all Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and state radiation safety requirements and hold the appropriate NRC license for production systems.

To summarize, CBP seeks new, innovative, high performance, NII technology approaches to image all containers, cargo and conveyances crossing U.S. borders in real time and (rail cars in near real time).

The CBP  is following a fast track source selection process calling for brief written technical proposals, past performance information and price proposals; followed by oral presentations and product demonstrations at the offeror’s facilities.

Questions about the RFP must be sent by email and received by the contracting officer not later than the close of business May 18, 2005.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.
A critical area of focus for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the development of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) Monitors that improve our capability to address the threat of a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD), an Improvised Nuclear Device (IND), or a nuclear weapon being used by terrorists within the US.  DHS is implementing a comprehensive systems approach that emphasizes early detection and effective intervention capabilities at the Federal, state, and local levels, as well as post-event capabilities for remediation.  Under this Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) Monitor Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), HSARPA solicits portal detection systems that will contribute to an overall system of countermeasures.  
BAA05-04 is meant to augment the radiological portal monitor projects initiated under BAA04-02 Technical Topic Area 3 (TTA-3), released January 31 2004, with a revised deliverable schedule and refined performance requirements.  BAA05-04 and BAA04-02 TTA-3 fit into an acquisition plan that includes independent developmental and operational tests.  

It is the intent of DHS to issue an RFP in the 3rd quarter of FY2005 for the large scale procurement of Spectroscopic Portals.  The source selection for that RFP will, in part, be based upon the technical and operational evaluation of products developed through awards made under BAA04-02 and this BAA.  To be eligible to bid to the upcoming Advanced Spectroscopic Portal RFP, bidders must be selected under this BAA or under the first round of BAA04-02.

FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitatio! n will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you g! ather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Supplies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitatio! n will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you g! ather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations. FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitatio! n will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you g! ather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Supplies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award a purchase order to Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS) on a sole source basis for the assembly and delivery of eight (8) Q-14/24 Common Post Mission Analysis Station (CPMA).  The workstations will be specifically configured to allow the AMCM helicopter squadrons to archive AN/AQS-14A and AN/AQS-24 on to high capacity DLT tapes and dual layer DVDs.  This will also give them the capability to review tactics data in a field environment and transfer multiple formats of data from the CPMA.  The CPMA station is a new item (Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 136 approved end 2004).  The Fleet will use this workstation for supporting AN/AQS-14A and AN/AQS-24. This procurement gives the Fleet an initial capability.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  IPS was heavily involved in the development, testing and analysis of the ECP to develop the CPMA (Har! dware and software).  They are the only company that is qualified to assemble, test and verify the functions of the CPMA with the actual Q-14 and Q-24 hardware.  They are also the only company that has the personnel that are qualified to operate the Q-14/24s, interface to the CPMAs and possess the Fleet knowledge to put together a system that meets the requirements of ECP 136 and gives the Fleet its initial capability to perform post mission analysis of sonar and laser missions.

<SUBJECT>R -- Syatematic  Reviews in Neonatal Medicine
<SOLNBR>RFP-NICHD-2005-16

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award a contract for a project entitled, “Systematic Reviews in Neonatal Medicine.”  The contractor is required to organize for conducting ongoing systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effectiveness and safety of neonatal clinical interventions as revealed in clinical trials, and provide the products of such reviews for posting on NICHD website.  The offeror will also publish, update, and disseminate the review products to the scientific community on a periodic basis.  In the mid 1980s, scientists from several countries developed processes for systematically developing evidence-based summaries on clinical therapies. By the early 1990s, a non-profit entity, The Cochrane Collaboration (CC) was formed in United Kingdom, which began a process of systematically updating clinical trials in many fields of medicine. The CC also established an ongoing Library of such reviews. In this backdrop, in 1995, the NICHD funded an unsolicited proposal from a scientist from McMaster University, Canada to develop a database of neonatal trials. The Neonatal Cochrane Review Group, NCRG, had been part of the Cochrane Collaboration. The reviews provided under this contract are posted on the NICHD website. At present (January 2005), there are 192 reviews on neonatal topics. Additional reviews are expected to continue until the end of the current NCRG contract. The proposed initiative is to solicit proposals from scientists to provide the NICHD with neonatal reviews similar to those by the NCRG that met with the standards of Cochrane Collaboration, and Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, as were done under the previous contract. In addition, the offerors will be required to develop means of dissemination of reviews to the scientific community and to provide continued support to the scientists conducting such reviews. A high priority of NICHD is the conduct of randomized clinical trials and the promotion of evidence-based practice of clinical medicine.  The contractor is required to provide the services of conducting systematic, quantitative reviews of the effectiveness and safety of therapies used in the care of sick newborn infants.  The resulting data and meta-analyses/reviews will be used by the Government to facilitate exchange of information among those involved in design and conduct of multi-center studies in this area, to provide information to clinicians in neonatology/perinatology, to provide information upon which to base priorities for future research and allocation of health-care resources, and to promote investigation on the translation of research into clinical practice.  The required service is defined as code 541690 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or before May 31, 2005 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All responses must be submitted on or before August 31, 2005, to Ms. Mya N. Hlaing, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, Suite 7A-07, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD MSC 7510, BETHESDA, MD 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A-07, Rockville, MD 20852).  Fully electronic copies will not be accepted.  The referenced number to be used for this announcement is: RFP-NICHD-2005-16.  All correspondence must cite the referenced number as provided.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to procure services of a contractor to provide accurate, comprehensive, real-time "commercial" real estate market data, hereafter, “market data” for approximately eight (8) concurrent users located nationally, with the potential to add up to 13 additional users throughout the term of the contract. IRS seeks access via a web-based service database to market data for all major U.S. metropolitan markets and their submarkets.  Additionally, the IRS manages a proprietary location modeling tool that determines the optimal location of IRS facilities by zip code designation.  The location modeling tool utilizes Geographic Information System technology and the market data output from the procured web-based service shall be easily transferred to the location model.  The web-based service shall allow the IRS to search for available commercial building inventory by zip code.  Further, property searches must be conducted in the web-based service database by overlaying a set of boundaries onto a map or aerial image in the web-based service database which will then provide available commercial building inventory within that delineated area.  Additionally, the web-based service shall allow IRS employees to analyze current and historical market conditions; verify building specific lease terms and conditions, i.e., asking rent rates, building vacancy rates, available square footage by floor, building class, up-to-date subject building transactions; building specific images (floor plans, and exterior and interior building photos); and new construction information.  The information presented shall be timely.  Real-time data is essential.  Also, there shall be a minimum of one (1) day of on-site training to ensure IRS users' understand the web-based product's capability.  On-going customer support for the term of the contract is also required to answer questions/troubleshoot, and to notify IRS of all system upgrades and new market data.  This shall be achieved via on-line demonstrations or contractor staffed call sites.  This customer service shall be available to the IRS Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST.  The Period of Performance is one year from date of award. Responsible parties that can provide the above requirement shall submit a written quotation of interest and capability by 12:00 noon EST on the date specified (March 15, 2005). Evaluation/award will be based on the contractor representing the best value to the Government, and cost.  Best value will be demonstrated first and foremost by technically meeting the aforementioned requirements and then cost.  All quotes shall include point of contact (name and telephone number), GSA Contract Number, if applicable, business size, and payment terms.  All questions shall be submitted in writing.  Responses will be accepted by facsimile at (202) 283-1533.  Facsimile responses must contain signatures, arrive at the place and by the time specified in the synopsis and may not exceed 10 pages.  The Government will not be responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or receipt of any facsimile information.  No solicitation will be issued; therefore, such request for solicitation will be considered non-responsive.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to publish the Request for Information (RFI) from an interested bidder and the Government responses. QUESTIONS FROM THE BIDDER: 1.  Is the vinyl that the Scope of work talks about wall paper or 1/16” hard vinyl? 2.  Is the vinyl covering full wall or half wall? 3.  Referring to vinyl cover walls, Will we have to float out all walls and texture? 4.  Does the post abatement testing have to be conducted by a Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIA)? RESPONSES FROM THE GOVERNMENT: 1, 2 & 3:	The references are to typical vinyl wall covering like is found in many commercial and residential buildings.  It is similar to wall parer but made of viny with a fabric backing.  It will probably peel right off the wall with very little effort.  Light sanding might be required to remove any dried wall covering paste that clings to the wall, but I don't think any thing else will be required. 4. All testing must be made by an independent testing laboratory  and under the supervision of a Certified Industrial Hygienist.  The CIH is not required to actually make all tests himself (herself) unless that is the laboratory's policy. As a result of this announcement, the Bid Due Date and Time remains the same at May 10, 2005 at 2:00 pm.

Also, an updated draft Attachment 2 (Section L), an updated draft Attachment 3  (Section M), Technical Concept Paper (TCP) and an updated Statement of  Objectives (SOO) have been posted in the Bidders Library at the end of this  announcement.  Changes have been made in red ink for ease in identification. UPDATE 27 April 2005:  A new document, the  B-52 SOJS Operational Synopsis  White Paper, has been posted in the Bidders Library at the end of this  announcement for information purposes. UPDATE 25 April 2005:  An updated draft Attachment 2 (Section L) and an  updated draft Attachment 3 (Section M) have been posted in the Bidders Library  at the end of this announcement.  Changes have been made in red ink for ease  in identification. UPDATE 07 April 2005:  An updated draft RFP has been posted in the Bidders  Library at the end of this announcment.  The purpose is to pass on the  incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. The following attachments to the RFP have been updated as well:  CDRL Exhibit  A, CDRL Exhibit B, Attachment 1 (SOO), Attachment 2 (Section L), Attachment 3  (Section M), and Attachment 4 (TCP) and the DD 254. UPDATE 25 March 2005:  The Airborne Electronic Attack Squadron (AEASS) cannot  release the B-52 SOJ RFP until final approval of the acquisition strategy  and  the source selection plan.  We anticipate that may take another two weeks.  In  the interim, we plan to post an updated draft in the next few days to pass on  the incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. As you are aware, we have been on a very aggressive schedule.  The delays we  are experiencing put our contract award schedule at risk.  We are requesting  your cooperation in helping us make up some schedule time by reducing the  number of days required for proposal preparation.  If you plan to bid this  program, request you provide the PCO feedback on the acceptability of reducing  the number of days for proposal submission from 45 days to a lesser number,  and identify the minimum time you believe is required.  Request your response  by 1 April 2005.  When a go-ahead is received from SAF/AQ and OSD, the AEASS  will determine the proposal due date and adjust the expected contract award  date accordingly.  UPDATE 22 March 2005:  A new attachment with the title of Questions and  Answers has been added to the document library below. UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.  Offerors are requested  to notify the PCO when the Past Performance volume is anticipated to be  submitted. UPDATE 9 March 2005 (Second update for this date):  RFP release is delayed  pending completion of the Government+s review/approval process.  Tentative  date for release is now 25 March 2005, in which case proposals will be due by  10 May 2005. However, the Past Performance Volume will be due by 15 Apr 2005.   The Government still plans to award the contract by the end of July 2005. Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors is modified by  making the following change to Table 3.1 Proposal Organization in Paragraph  3.1.5.2, Organization, Number of Copies, and Page Limits.  The maximum page  limit for Vol III, Past Performance, is now 60 pages.  Within those 60 pages,  there should be no more than 5 pages per each past contract. UPDATE 9 March 2005:  The briefings and documents promised at the B-52 Stand- off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference on 16 Feb 2005 are now available for  distribution.  There are two CDs available for distribution.  The first CD  (unclassified) was mailed on 7 Mar 05 to each company /office that attended  the conference.

We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<CONTACT>Kevin McGowan, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-0708, Fax 301-443-3238, Email kmcgowan@psc.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with Market Strategies, Inc., 20255 Victor Parkway, Suite 400 Livonia, Michigan 48152, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  The purpose of this requirement is to assist the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in conducting a follow-up survey of consumers aged 50 to 70 in states participating in the Department’s Long-Term Care Awareness Campaign. A Contractor must have the ability to continue the processing of the survey data, without duplication of effort, from the previous two baseline surveys conducted before the campaign ran, as well as the names and phone numbers of the most recent baseline survey conducted in November and December of 2004.  A critical requirement of this acquisition is that the contractor possesses considerable background in the baseline research conducted for the Awareness Campaign.  Market Strategies, Inc. Is the only firm the Government is aware of which has access to the proprietary list of previously sampled consumers in the target market, as well as having systems already in place to conduct the CATI survey and the ability to merge the data into a single analytic file that contains the most recent pre and the yet to be conducted post survey responses.  Contractors must have; 1) access to the list of consumers who were interviewed for the most recent baseline survey, 2) the data system capabilities for conducting the CATI survey and merging the two files, 3) acquire specialized knowledge of the initial baseline survey and its value in the analysis of the more recent baseline and follow-up surveys.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a capability statement with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements as described above.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to Mr. Kevin McGowan, via E-Mail at KMcGowan@psc.gov.  All submissions of capability statements must be submitted via electronic mail to the aforementioned address by no later than close of business (3:00pm EST), May 20, 2005.  See Note 22.

AMENDMENT NUMBER 01:The response (see below) is in regard to two questions (see below) received in reference to a  Pre-Solicitation Notice 05S04022005 (see above), requiring access to a mailing list/data used in a baseline survey, which this work is a follow on to.  At this time, the Government can no longer guarantee a response to any further questions submitted.  The due date for submission of Capability Statements remains May 20, 2005.

QUESTION:	The synopsis says that "Contractors must have; 1) access to the list of consumers who were interviewed for the most recent baseline survey..."  Is this something that would be provided, or that our firm must just simply have?

QUESTION:	We would like to know the entity that conducted the other surveys and a better understanding of the ‘proprietary list’ of previously sampled consumers. Wouldn’t the list be open, at this point, given the group was originally sampled with Federal funds?

ANSWER:	The required data is the previous mailing list used to conduct the original survey.  This mailing list/data is a proprietary list which was accessed by a previous Contractor for limited use, at a price.  Consequently, this same mailing list/data is accessible to any Contractor at a cost. Since the list/data was not created, for use by the Government, or at the Government expense, it does not belong to the Government and access to the list must be obtained by paying for it.  The details for accessing this list will be provided to the wining Contractor after award.  The Contractor will then have to load the mailing list/data and the previous baseline data, and take all necessary steps to be prepared for this follow-up function.

<DESC>This amendment is hereby issued to correct the Response Due Date in the description block to read March 17, 2005 instead of March 15, 2005.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. 

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to procure services of a contractor to provide accurate, comprehensive, real-time "commercial" real estate market data, hereafter, “market data” for approximately eight (8) concurrent users located nationally, with the potential to add up to 13 additional users throughout the term of the contract. IRS seeks access via a web-based service database to market data for all major U.S. metropolitan markets and their submarkets.  Additionally, the IRS manages a proprietary location modeling tool that determines the optimal location of IRS facilities by zip code designation.  The location modeling tool utilizes Geographic Information System technology and the market data output from the procured web-based service shall be easily transferred to the location model.  The web-based service shall allow the IRS to search for available commercial building inventory by zip code.  Further, property searches must be conducted in the web-based service database by overlaying a set of boundaries onto a map or aerial image in the web-based service database which will then provide available commercial building inventory within that delineated area.  Additionally, the web-based service shall allow IRS employees to analyze current and historical market conditions; verify building specific lease terms and conditions, i.e., asking rent rates, building vacancy rates, available square footage by floor, building class, up-to-date subject building transactions; building specific images (floor plans, and exterior and interior building photos); and new construction information.  The information presented shall be timely.  Real-time data is essential.  Also, there shall be a minimum of one (1) day of on-site training to ensure IRS users' understand the web-based product's capability.  On-going customer support for the term of the contract is also required to answer questions/troubleshoot, and to notify IRS of all system upgrades and new market data.  This shall be achieved via on-line demonstrations or contractor staffed call sites.  This customer service shall be available to the IRS Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST.  The Period of Performance is one year from date of award. Responsible parties that can provide the above requirement shall submit a written quotation of interest and capability by 12:00 noon EST on the date specified (March 15, 2005). Evaluation/award will be based on the contractor representing the best value to the Government, and cost.  Best value will be demonstrated first and foremost by technically meeting the aforementioned requirements and then cost.  All quotes shall include point of contact (name and telephone number), GSA Contract Number, if applicable, business size, and payment terms.  All questions shall be submitted in writing.  Responses will be accepted by facsimile at (202) 283-1533.  Facsimile responses must contain signatures, arrive at the place and by the time specified in the synopsis and may not exceed 10 pages.  The Government will not be responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or receipt of any facsimile information.  No solicitation will be issued; therefore, such request for solicitation will be considered non-responsive.

<DESC>AMENDED REQUEST FOR INFORMATION / SOURCES SOUGHT TO CORRECT RESPONSE DUE DATE.  RESPONSE DUE DATE SHOULD READ 15 MAY 2005 @ 4:00 PM.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10, MARKET RESEARCH. 

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) seeks public comment on 
Section 508 Conversion Tool for Converting MS-Office Documents to Section 508-Compliant HTML.

This request for information is being posted on behalf of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Operating Administrations (OA) that are listed below:

Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST)
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
Maritime Administration (MARAD)
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
Office of the Inspector General (OIG)
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)
Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA)
Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC)
Surface Transportation Board (STB)

BACKGROUND:

The DOT OA’s have varying processes for posting information on web pages.  Some have web teams that handle all of the development, testing, and posting.  While in other OA’s, program offices develop documents that need to be posted and forward them to the web team for testing and posting.  Regardless of the process, all documents posted on Federal Agency web pages must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires that information be accessible to people with disabilities.  For many documents, this can best be achieved by creating an HTML version of the document.  

The DOT uses Microsoft ® Office as its standard office automation suite.  The tools in the suite (e.g. Word, Excel, PowerPoint) have a native “Save as Web Page” feature that creates HTML that is coded in so that the documents can easily be opened back up in the tool in which the document was created.  Unfortunately, this HTML currently does not conform to the standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3) or the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards.

The DOT is exploring alternatives to the native “Save as Web Page” feature for documents authored and modified using Microsoft ® Office.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

At a minimum, the Section 508 conversion tool must:

1.	Have the ability to convert documents created using Microsoft ® Office (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) into HTML that conforms to:
a.	HTML 4.01 Transitional or higher, as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium
b.	Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, Conversion includes but not limited to:
i.	Identify and apply headings to data tables,
ii.	Associate table data cells with their respective headings,
iii.	Provide the ability to insert alternative text to meaningful images,
iv.	Provide the ability to insert blank alternative text for decorative images (example alt=””),
v.	Provide the ability to textually describe charts and graphs,
vi.	Provide the ability to explicitly label embedded form fields,
vii.	Provide the ability to group embedded images/objects that collectively form a graph, chart, equation, formula etc. – Desirable, but not required,
c.	Render the compliant HTML to XHTML standards – Desirable, but not required;
 
2.	Itself be compliant with the applicable Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards;

3.	Be compatible with Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2 or more recent; and

4.	Being a plug-in to MS-Office ®, as opposed to a standalone tool, is desirable, but not required.

OTHER:
There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. Responses are being solicited on how your approach / solution address our functional requirements.  Include product specifications (software / hardware) requirements and an estimated pricing on an individual and volume basis. NO SAMPLES / TRIAL VERSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THIS STAGE.  The due date for the responses is May 15, 2005(CORRECTED).     This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor’s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified as such.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Attached document contains all hyperlinks for further information.  Responses including the specified documentation shall be e-mailed to: Angel.Delgado@fhwa.dot.gov or Rick.Murray@fhwa.dot.gov. No facsimile response will be accepted.

<DESC>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE MODIFICATION NOW INCLUDES INSTRUCTIONS FOR VIEWING THE BENCHMARK INSTRUCTIONS.



HPCMP Phase I Request for Quotes – DRAFT

Note: This is a DRAFT Request for Quotations (RFQ), and vendors are not expected to submit proposals at this time.  This Draft RFQ is issued in an effort to promote early exchange of information between the Government and industry.  This Draft RFQ will allow potential bidders to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and possibly enhance the Government’s ability to obtain quality supplies and services, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in bid preparation, evaluation, negotiation, and Delivery Order award.

This Draft RFQ does not bind the Government to issue a Final version of the RFQ, nor to award any Delivery Order(s) as a result.  This Draft RFQ is for planning purposes only, and should be used for such.

A Final RFQ Phase I is expected for release on or about 16-20 May 2005.

Draft Benchmark Instructions are now posted to the DoD HPCMP website.  To view the full text of these Benchmarks, see the following website address:  Go to www.hpcmo.hpc.mil.  Click on TI06 Information and Documents, click on TI-06 Benchmark Instructions.


The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) is seeking initial quotes for a uniform range of HPC configurations and associated maintenance against GSA Schedule 70 contracts to address the non-real time HPC requirements for its user base of scientists and engineers across the HPCMP High Performance Computing (HPC) Centers, including Major Shared Resource Centers (MSRCs), selected Allocated Distributed Centers (ADCs), and Dedicated HPC Project Investments (DHPIs) previously indentified as Dedicated Distributed Centers (DDCs).  Information obtained from the initial Phase I responses will be used in conjunction with benchmark performance data obtained from potential Offerors to determine solutions to address HPCMP user requirements. No awards will be made from the initial RFQ.  On or about 12 Sep 2005 a final RFQ (Phase II) for one or more specific HPCMP funded sites will be sought.   General information is provided below and in the attachments to give Offerors a better understanding of the terms and conditions which may be required for systems and services acquired. The following attachments generally reflect the Program’s expectations:  Terms and Conditions; Acceptance Testing; Warranty and Maintenance; and Acceptance Test Plan template.  These are draft documents that may be changed when Phase II of the RFQ is released.  The Government may make multiple awards using the Phase II RFQ; however, the Government also reserves the right not to make any award if deemed in its best interest. 

To view the full text of this Draft RFQ, see the following website address:  Go to www.hpcmo.hpc.mil.  Click on TI06 Information and Documents, click on GSA's Draft Phase I RFQ.

<DESC>The Memphis Purchasing Service Center of the United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking supplier input regarding possible future third party logistics (3pl) operations.  In order to gain better insight into what capabilities exist in this marketplace the USPS will be conducting a series of supplier workshops.  These workshops will consist of a presentation by the supplier of their companies capabilities followed by a question and answer session.  It is anticipated each supplier workshop will last between two and three hours.  Listed below is a general overview of the project and the criteria we will use to choose workshop participants:

The US Postal Service is looking to establish a working relationship with a third party logistics provider to increase flexibility in supporting warehousing and distribution activities.  This effort will include establishing data flows for initial receipt, receiving and shipment of orders, reporting completion of tasks associated with material stocked, and identify performance measurements relative to each product set. 

Support will be needed in providing the ability to expand and contract a network for fulfilling warehousing and distribution requirements at the National level. We are also looking to expand our local distribution in approximately 20 major metropolitan areas across the country. This will involve providing a 2 hour response window from the time of receipt of the order until the site physically receives the material.  This includes the ability to incorporate systems integration capability and capacity to interface with internal organizations and external suppliers.    

The following are the criteria we want to discuss within the Workshop: 
[A] Current and Past Performance; [B] Existing Distribution Network Capabilities; [C] Systems Capabilities and Integration; [D] Startup and Integration Capabilities; and [E] Systems Integration; [F] Innovative  Solutions and New Industry Trends.


Suppliers should limit their submissions to not more than 10 pages.

Only six timeslots are available.  Suppliers will be selected based upon the uniqueness of their above submissions.  These sessions are to gain knowledge of the marketplace only and failure to be selected to participate will not influence any future source selection decisions.  

Workshops will be conducted at:	USPS Material Distribution Center
					500 SW Gary Ormsby Drive
					Topeka, KS 66624-9998

Workshops are tentatively scheduled to take place June 8-10, 2005.

Interested suppliers should submit the information stated above electronically to Mark Treese at mark.l.treese@usps.gov not later than 4:00PM May 23, 2005.

<DESC>The Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) program has a need to replace its 1089 aging ceilometers (cloud height sensors).  The current ceilometer detects clouds and measures cloud heights to 12,000 feet.  The new requirement is 25,000 feet for most locations in support of aviation requirements, and 40,000 feet at approximately 240 locations in support of both aviation and climate requirements.  The project budget is $31.4M spread over 2005 through 2009.  This acquisition as currently envisioned will consist of four phases: Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Sensor Evaluation, Development & System Integration, Limited Production, and Full Scale Production.  The Government intends to award firm fixed-price contracts to several vendors for the COTS Sensor Evaluation phase, with the three other phases as firm fixed-price options.  The Government intends to down select to one or two vendors for the optional phases.  Award of each optional phase will be contingent upon successful completion of the preceding phase. Additional details may be found in the attached draft Pricing Structure, Statement of Work, and Specification.  Interested parties are requested to notify the contracting officer that they wish to receive the Request for Proposals (RFP).  Further, timely comments about the draft documents will be considered as the government finalizes its acquisition strategy and the RFP.  Please direct questions and comments to the contracting officer.  Draft documents are posted at the following web address: http://www.ofa.noaa.gov/%7Eamd/solindex.shtml

<DESC>AIRCRAFT CORROSION CONTROL SERVICES: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. Currently, there is no funding in place and no solicitation package is available at this time.   Dover AFB, DE is seeking information regarding the availability of qualified “Small Business concerns”, to perform Aircraft Corrosion Control Services at Dover Air Force Base. To qualify as a Small Business concern, a firm and its affiliates must be independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on the government contract, and qualifies as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR Part 121 (see FAR 19.102). Specifically, this requirement will be solicited under NAICS Code – 561720, SIC Code – 4581, and a Small Business Set-Aside size of $14,000,000.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED: The contractor shall provide personnel, equipment, materials, supervision, transportation, a contract manager, and other items and services necessary to perform Aircraft Corrosion Control Services for Dover Air Force Base’s C-5 fleet. There is currently an incumbant contractor in place that performs normal aircraft wash and lubrication services.  However, the government is seeking to procure a new contract that encompasses “cradle-to-grave” operations by the contractor.  Cradle-to-grave means that the contractor will perform: aircraft towing to the wash facility, aircraft preparation, interior and exterior aircraft washing, lubrication, aircraft reconfiguration, and respotting of the aircraft. The initial contract period will be for the period 1 October 2005 through 30 September 2006. Option Year 1 is 1 October 2006 through 30 September 2007. Option Year 2 is 1 October 2007 through 30 September 2008. Option Year 3 is 1 October 2008 through 30 September 2009. Option Year 4 is 1 October 2009 through 30 September 2010. If Dover Air Force Base receives sufficient positive responses to this request for information, the referenced services will be set-aside for the most critical small business socio-economic goal in which adequate competition exists. All prospective offerors who meet the above requirements must have a commercial and government entity code (CAGE) and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (http://www.bpn.gov). All responses may be faxed to the attention of Brett Clark at 302-677-5217 or may be emailed to brett.clark@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>The scope of the effort entails performing a mix of design, fabrication, installation, integration, verification and fielding of the Non-Live Fire MOUT.  Extensive studies by the Marine Corps War-fighting Laboratory has shown that units trained to operate an integrated combined arms team are more successful within the urban battle space and suffer fewer casualties.  With this in mind and given the nature of operations in support of OIF the requirement to train Battalion sized forces is critical.  This training is required to ensure Marines are properly trained prior to deployment for real world operations in Iraq.  Facilities are required in order for the Marine Corps to conduct quality and credible battalion level force-on-force SASO and/or MOUT training.   The Non-Live Fire MOUT Facilities will primarily be used for company and battalion force-on-force fire and maneuver training using SESAMs ammunition and MILES gear within an urban terrain facility. The Marine Corps System Command, Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS), intends to releases a DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Systems Requirements Document for industry comment. The potential offeror or interested parties should provide their comments to the documents indicating ability to meet specified requirements, specific items requiring clarification for responsive industry proposal, and specified requirements which un-necessarily drive system procurement or lifecycle cost.

<SUBJECT>93--AVAILABLE CANDIDATE THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM MATERIALS
<SOLNBR>NNM05ZPS008L
<RESPDATE>060605
<ARCHDATE>05062006
<CONTACT>Janice P. Burrough, Contracting Officer, Phone (256) 544-0317, Fax (256) 544-5861, Email Janice.Burrough@nasa.gov
<DESC>Summary: This Request for Information (RFI), issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA MSFC), seeks information on available candidate thermal protection system materials for consideration under the “Lightweight Nonmetallic Thermal Protection Materials Technology (LNTPMT)” Project.	This project is being performed for the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) with the primary purpose of advancing the state of thermal protection system (TPS) materials technology.  Such technology advancements will enable the development of advanced heatshields and TPS architectures in parallel and follow-on ESMD projects.  Additionally, partnerships with industry, academia, and non-NASA government entities are being sought for Phase II of this project --- Phase II is planned to begin in January 2006. RFI Purpose:   It is emphasized that this presolicitation synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.	Release of this RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  NASA MSFC is seeking advanced thermal protection materials technology in order to best accomplish the goals of the Lightweight Nonmetallic Thermal Protection Materials Technology (LNTPMT) Project.  We are therefore requesting information regarding candidate materials technologies for accomplishing this.	Information provided will be used to supplement the on-going 2005 project activities, and to facilitate potential establishment of teaming arrangements (such as through Space Act Agreements) with material developers/manufacturers/suppliers in Phase II of the LNTPMT project.	Such partnerships or teaming arrangements may involve industry providing materials/specimens and NASA providing testing, data generation/analysis, and reporting.  While our intent may be to team with industry partners, we are not bound by this RFI to do so.   Please note, also, that the LNTPMT Project intends to host a government/industry TPS Materials Summit meeting at the NASA Ames Research Center on 25-27 October 2005 to both review the Phase I progress and the Phase II plans for this project, and to allow other TPS presentations to be given on technologies applicable to the LNTPMT Project and the overall ESMD Program. Technology Advancement:  The thermal protection subsystem elements required for ESMD planetary hypersonic entry probes and/or landers will include various combinations of the following:  (1) passive ablative insulators, (2) reusable passive insulators, (3) "hot structure" ceramic matrix composites, (4) adhesive/attachment hardware, (5) supporting aeroshell structure, (6) hot structure thermal isolation insulation blankets/materials, and (7) inflatable/deployable decelerators (ballutes) and their associated attachment and deployment hardware.  The traditional thermal protection subsystem elements that current space system architectures embody:  are typically heavy (high mass fraction with respect to payload); are labor/cost intensive for procurement, fabrication, assembly, and post-flight refurbishment (if reusable); and have limited thermal performance capability (Shuttle Orbiter reusable tile system and Viking ablator system).  The only ablator material ever human-rated, used on the Apollo Program’s Command Module, is not in production, is no longer available, and was labor/cost intensive to use. Present and future NASA missions require thermal protection systems capable of supporting the following:	(1) medium-to-large-payload robotic planetary science missions, (2) ESMD Spirals 1-5 (low Earth orbit, lunar return, long duration moon/lunar return, Mars flybys and Mars returns, and manned Mars landings and return missions), (3) direct planetary hypersonic entries, (4) planetary aerocapture orbit insertions, and (5) low-to-medium lift-over-drag-ratio vehicle configurations.  The extreme challenges for mass efficiency  and thermal performance on these missions makes it essential that the TPS materials and systems utilized place a lower burden on the overall vehicle system resources using current state-of-the-art technology in order that meaningful payloads can be supported.  Thus, state-of-the-art materials need to be evaluated, demonstrated, and validated for system designs supporting future NASA full-scale development programs. Therefore, the LNTPMT Project is seeking to identify, evaluate, and mature (where possible, through NASA Technology Readiness Level 5) technologies that would substantially advance heatshield TPS technology for ESMD heatshield architectures in a manner that significantly expands functional capability, adaptability, and reliability while appreciably reducing mass and cost (when compared to current systems).  The technologies sought must be of sufficient maturity that they could be readied for utilization in early Exploration Systems and Science Mission Directorates vehicles.  This inquiry seeks information on candidate materials for specific focused applications, not generic technologies, which could substantially improve the performance and capability of the potential system to be developed and flown. Additional overview-type information on the “Lightweight Nonmetallic Thermal Protection Materials Technology” Project can be found in the attached document. Information Desired:   The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center is interested in soliciting information regarding available candidate thermal protection system materials that industry deems to be viable candidates for use as heatshield materials for NASA Exploration Systems missions.  Responses should include details describing:  (a) the material(s), (b) programs/projects completed or in progress to mature the material technology, and (c) basic material property and performance information that is pertinent and necessary to evaluate applicability to NASA missions.  The overall objectives of this RFI are:  (1) to improve NASA's knowledge of industry's capabilities; (2) to improve the overall understanding of what the technology options are for the LNTPMT Project; and (3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow NASA to assess the Phase II partnering opportunities that exist with industry. Responses to this RFI should be received not later than June 06, 2005.	Responses should be in the form of written and illustrated concepts.  Within 60 days of RFI release, repondents who present materials technology that offers significant benefits to the LNTPMT Project (and ESMD in general), may be offered the opportunity to make presentations to the LNTPMT Project Team. RFI responses can be submitted via e-mail.  The subject line of the submission should be "RFI for Lightweight Nonmetallic Thermal Protection Materials Technology Project."  Attachments should be provided in Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or Adobe Acrobat formats.  The e-mail text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, e-mail address, and business size.  Size standard for a small business for NAICS code 336419 is 1,000 employees or less.  It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained.  To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. Technical questions or comments should be directed to: Peter G. Valentine at (256) 544-2837 or Peter.G.Valentine@nasa.gov, or Timothy W. Lawrence at (256) 544-2660 or Timothy.W.Lawrence@nasa.gov. (Facsimile (256) 544-5877). Procurement-related questions should be directed to:	Janice Burrough at (256) 544-0317 or janice.burrough@nasa.gov. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or comercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<SUBJECT>A -- Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) Program
<DESC>The Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) program is soliciting proposals due 21 June 2005.  Point of Contact (POC): Dr. Greg Duckworth, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714; facsimile: (703) 807-1783; e-mail: BAA05-32@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred).  

OBJECTIVE:  In support of the RSN Program, DARPA/SPO is soliciting proposals (both technical and cost) from qualified corporations, research institutions, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC’s) and Department of Energy (DoE) laboratories under BAA05-32.  The RSN program focuses on creating a capability to allow military operations to have GPS-level navigation functions in GPS-denied areas, including conditions of GPS denial world-wide.  GPS denial is a real and asymmetric threat against our armed forces.  DARPA is looking to use the widely available, powerful, and economically important signals of opportunity (e.g. television, radio, and satellite-based broadcasts) to provide a robust non-GPS capability for geo-location of our stationary sensors, and navigation for our mobile assets.  The strength, availability, and diversity in frequency and direction of travel of these signals allow them to be used in environments that GPS will not currently work, such as under foliage, in urban canyons, and inside surface structures.  What remains to be done is to develop a system architecture and set of algorithms that will allow user receivers to exploit the signals from these non-cooperative sources in highly multipathed environments.

The goal of this program is to produce a non-form/fit functional prototype for a demonstration of the capability.  The RSN system must solve the fundamental problem of navigation and geolocation in GPS-denied areas, especially in the difficult environments of inside buildings and in urban canyons.  A key feature of the system is the ability of the system concept and architecture to exploit these signals as globally and as non-intrusively as possible.  DARPA envisions the capability to span the range of user platforms from airborne fast-movers to sensors and ground forces in urban interiors.  It should use a layered approach that uses, for example, signal-of-opportunity “calibration reference” ground stations at maximum practicable standoff for wide area coverage, but that can easily and smoothly transition to more intrusive active beacons as necessary to augment the signals of opportunity when they are inadequate for the task.

A related task within the Navigation via Signals of Opportunity (NAVSOPP) approach, Sub-Surface Navigation via Signals of Opportunity (SSN), will solve a similar problem, but will concentrate on geolocation and navigation in deep basements, underground facilities, caves, and tunnels.  The SSN program will be announced separately from RSN.

OBJECTIVE:  In support of the SSN Program, DARPA/SPO is soliciting proposals (both technical and cost) from qualified corporations, research institutions, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC’s) and Department of Energy (DoE) laboratories under BAA05-33  While GPS is sometimes denied on the surface of the Earth; and provides limited to very poor performance under foliage, in urban environments outdoors, and inside surface buildings, it is always denied to assets and users underground in tunnels, underground facilities (UGF's), and caves.  The SSN program focuses on creating this capability to allow military operations to have GPS-level navigation functions in underground facilities.  The SSN goal of providing geo-location and navigation capability to users in these environments will provide a much-needed capability to our forces in the face of increasing use of these underground havens by our adversaries.

The goal of this program is to produce a non-form/fit functional prototype for a demonstration of the capability.  The SSN system must solve the fundamental problem of navigation and geolocation in GPS-denied areas, specifically in underground facilities, tunnels, and caves.  Ideally, the SSN concept will use available Signals of Opportunity (SoOP).  Realizing that very few SoOP will penetrate the earth’s surface enough to be usable, the SSN system should employ a layered approach where, for example, forces could place special purpose beacons a safe distance from the underground facility in question if SoOP are unavailable or unusable.  

A related task within the navigation via signals of opportunity approach, Robust Surface Navigation (RSN), will solve a similar geolocation problem, but will concentrate on geolocation and navigation in urban canyons and inside buildings.  The RSN program will be announced separately from SSN.

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INTEREST (RFI) FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A PROCUREMENT PORTAL FOR THE U.S. MARINE CORPS
<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The Marine Corps is conducting an end-to-end analysis of the procurement process and identifying ways to streamline the process making it more efficient and effective.  As a result of this analysis, the Marine Corps is researching the possibility of developing or utilizing a system (e.g. web-based portal) to assist with the acquisition of goods and services.  This portal would provide a single interface module for personnel involved in acquiring goods and services. PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to determine if there is credible interest in the development of a system/portal described below.  Elaborate proposals or pricing information is neither required nor desired, as the intent is to identify credible interest before federal or nonfederal resources are committed to expensive studies or proposals.  This RFI is not a solicitation or Request for Proposal/Quote in any form.  Proposals/quotes or any other formal offers will not be accepted or considered by the Government in response to this RFI.  No contract will result from this RFI or any information submitted in response to it. The system/portal will have several different users:  requirements generators, contracting personnel, legal personnel, comptroller/fiscal personnel, and program/project managers.  User interaction will depend on the type of user.  For requirements generators the portal will ask the user a series of questions to identify what is to be acquired (product, service, quantity/amount, delivery schedule, unit of issue, etc.) or provided from within the Government organization itself, or provided by a supporting Government agency. Once the requirement is defined the portal provides a checklist of items/actions that must be needed for the type of requirement identified as well as templates for these items.  Templates should be available in an easily downloadable format such as Microsoft Word.  Checklists and templates will be based on acquisition policy and regulations required for the particular item or service.  The portal then directs user to the appropriate source (web tool or off! ice) to fulfill this requirement. For contracting personnel, legal personnel, comptroller/fiscal personnel, and execution managers, the system/portal will send them a notification when a new requirement is developed.  These users will have access to review draft documents and provide comments.  The contracting personnel can then contact the requirements generator with specific questions or changes as needed.  The comptroller/fiscal personnel will also be able to determine if appropriate funds are available based on the draft document.  Once comments have been submitted, system/portal will send a notice to the requirements generator allowing them to view all comments. The system/portal will have ability to integrate user’s information/request into the various procurement modules (GCSS Oracle, Seaport-e, DoD e-Mall, etc.) to determine where to direct a user. As mentioned above, the system/portal will ask user a series of questions to determine where to direct user.  Direction will be determined based on procurement procedures and regulations that are in place and are integrated into the system/portal.  The portal should be flexible enough for Marine Corps staff to add or change procedures and policies as needed.    The portal needs the ability to interact with those procurement modules identified above and with any new procurement modules that are developed and utilized by the Marine Corps. Portal needs to interact with existing contracting and payment systems such as PR Builder, SPS, and Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). For example, the requirements generator should be able to submit a statement of work through the portal that will transfer into PR Builder eliminating duplication of effort.  The portal will interact with external users as needed/appropriate. Portal will need to have a high level of reliability and security as well as be Navy Marine Corps Internet (NMCI) compliant.  Users will need to request access from a central manager (within the Marine Corps) and will need a password to get into the portal.   SUBMITTAL CONTENTS:  The statement of interest shall include as a minimum the following components:  (1) what systems, if any, you currently have that could solve this need, (2) your entity’s capability and experience in developing this type system or portal.  Elaborate proposals or pricing information is not required and should not be submitted.  The  Government will not award a contract based on this RFI nor will participants be reimbursed for any costs associated with preparing and/or submitting responses.  SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES:   Interested parties shall submit a statement of interest on company letterhead to: Mr. Lee Robinson, Regional Contracting Office Northeast, 3250 Catlin Avenue, Marine Corps Base, Quantico, VA 22134-5001 no later than 1400, June 6, 2005.   Only one statement of interest shall be submitted by any one company or agency and should not exceed fifteen (15) pages in length (single space, 10 or 12 font).  Questions should be addressed to:  Lee.Robinson@ usmc.mil no later than  1200, May 12, 2005.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

DESCRIPTION:

The purpose of this research proposal is to determine if the requirements for the stop net fishery, as published in the November 10, 2004, proposed rule to implement the Bottlenose Dolphin Take Reduction Plan (BDTRP), will result in increased bycatch of other marine species, while reducing bottlenose dolphin entanglements and strandings.  The contractor shall provide the research and analysis per the minimum requirements shown herein.

This research will be utilized by the NMFS, SERO to evaluate bycatch of all marine species, including actively managed, in experimental nets (first 300 ft. of 4-inch stretch mesh) versus control nets (first 300 ft. of 8-inch stretch mesh), and to examine the behavior of coastal bottlenose dolphin interactions around both experimental and control nets.
REQUIREMENTS:


General Requirements

In order to adequately meet the stated purpose and objectives, several criteria will be required for successful proposals:

1.	The study must occur only during the stop net fishing season as designated by the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) proclamation.

2.	Applicants must maintain all required local, state, and federal permits.

3.	Applicants must collaborate with traditional stop net commercial fishermen in North Carolina on fine-tuning the sampling design and execution of the study.

4.	Objectives must be investigated using at least two experimental nets (first 300 feet [100 yards] of stop net is multi-fiber nylon that is 4-inches stretched mesh) and two control nets (first 300 feet [100 yards] of stop net is multi-fiber nylon that is 8-inches stretched mesh).

5.	Experimental and control nets must contain the same net configuration, with the exception of different stretched mesh size in the first 300 feet of the net as stated above.

6.	As much as operationally feasible, experimental and control nets must soak for the same period of time and have the same percentage of hauls, and soak times must be the same as normally used by the traditional stop net fishermen.

7.	Bycatch of all marine species, including interactions with bottlenose dolphins, will be recorded per each section of the stop net (i.e., suds, backstaff, and lead).

8.	Species, lengths and weights of all bycaught species will be recorded.

9.	Researcher must maintain presence during all net sets for the entire season.

Deliverables

1.	The contractor must submit a detailed sampling design with experimental and control net locations depicted on a map or via ArcGIS one month prior to commencement of study.

2.	The contractor must provide an informal, bi-weekly report via phone or email throughout the actual study period during the stop net fishing season.  This report should include specific reference to bottlenose dolphin entanglements, as appropriate.

3.	The contractor must also provide a final report detailing the methods, results, discussions, and potential management implications no later than 60 days after the study concludes, following the close of the stop net fishery season.

4.	Deliverables shall be provided to:  NMFS, SERO, Protected Resources Division, 263 13th Avenue South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701.

Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions Installation and Registration Checklist

Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts

1.     Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) (www.ccr.gov) to see if your company is registered.
       If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below.
       For help with registration in CCR, contact the CCR Help desk, 888-227-2423 or e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.

2.     Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).
       All vendors desiring to quote on goods or services in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/.     
       Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/Fax number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc).
       Note:     All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually.     Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.

3.     Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).
       The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company.     You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm.
       To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on   Search CCR.     Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click   Submit Query  .     If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS.
       Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page.     There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC.     If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet.  If you see that there is no one listed as your company s EB POC, you need to click on  Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN  to add it.
       Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC s (primary and alternate) for each CAGE/DUNS combination.
       The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor s organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor.
       Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.     Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete.     For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html





4.     Establish a group in WAWF-RA associated with your cage code(s).     This can be 
           done by calling DISA-Ogden Customer Support at 1-800-392-1798 or by
           e-mailing cscassig@ogden.disa.mil


5.     Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM).     (Proceed to paragraph 6 if you are not going to designate a GAM).In medium to large sized companies, there may be need to establish more than one GAM. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC.     To appoint additional GAM s, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. 	The appointment letter should be faxaed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.	The Group Administrator s Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users.
       The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.


6.     Establish an organizational e-mail address
       All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes, the system generates an e-mail notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm s organizational e-mail account.
       The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational e-mail to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
       Ensure that your firm s organizational e-mail address is operational and can receive e-mail from WAWF-RA prior to registering your e-mail address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
       Note:     If you do not set up an organizational e-mail address, the personal e-mail address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational e-mail address for your firm.


7.     Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA
       Set up the PCs of your organization s users to access WAWF-RA.
       Select the  Setting Up Your Machine  link on the WAWF-RA home page.     For more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.


8.     Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA website
       Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA website by completing the on-line registration form.
       Select the  Self Register  link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions.
       Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate.     Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering.
       PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operation Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com.     The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate.
       If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.

<DESC>This is an amendment to solicitation HSCG23-05-Q-PBM002. As a result of the following amendment, this soliciation is extended to 4:00 PM East Coast Time on 10 May 2005. 

This amendment is issued to attach Wage Determination No: 94-2543 Rev (36) Area:  Norfolk, VA; to add the Notice for Filing Agency Protests to the RFQ; and to provide questions and answers about the Request for Quote.  

1. The Wage Determination is attached separately.

2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Commandant (CG-851)
2100 Second Street, SW, Room 2606
Washington, DC  20593
Telephone  (202) 267-2285
FAX        (202) 267-4011


3. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

QUESTION 1.  In order for me to conduct a training needs assessment for the proposed curriculum, I need to identify the target audience. What is the technical background of the average student (Coast Guard Marine Inspector)?

ANSWER 1.   The target audience is Coast Guard Marine Inspectors who have been on the job for more than a year and have attained (or have made substantial strides towards attaining) a Hull or Machinery qualification.  The technical background of each student varies due primarily to their prior CG experience and officer accession source.  Some may have several years of experience while others only about a year or so.

QUESTION 2:   Do they have any training and/or common skill sets in welding or ship repair?

 ANSWER  2:  All have obtained basic weld inspection and hull repair methods in a formal setting (i.e. Yorktown) as well as on-the-job training at their respective units.

QUESTION 3:  Should the quote be a lump sum for all ten (10) classes, or a figure for each course presentation?

ANSWER 3:  The quote should be stated as the cost for the individual class and the extended cost when multiplied by the number of classes at a particular cost.  

If you have questions, please e-mail Arita Tillman at atillman@comdt.uscg.mil or call 202-475-3217.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 001 --
This amendment is being issued to address questions received for the combined synopsis/solicitation NFFK000123JMH. 

1.  	The solicitation requests proposals for a 2 year effort without giving adequate chance to prospective vendors like us to review the existing system?  Is it possible for us to review the existing system so that we can better server with intelligent cost estimate efforts on the proposal?
The existing system may be viewed at the web address:    http://fishresearch.nwr.noaa.gov/ .
The first phase of the new system may be viewed at the following web address:     http://apps.nmfs.noaa.gov/  (URL provided in Solicitation).

2.  	Also, the solicitation does not indicate what kind of proposal you are looking for?  Is it Time and Materials or Fixed Price?
 It is a Fixed Price requirement.

3.	If it is a fixed price request for proposal, as a prospective vendor, we need some sort of existing system documentation or a demo to come up with a right cost proposal.
Please see the URLs above in numbers 1 and 2.

4.	Can the offeror provide T&M rates?
Any proposed labor category prices shall include the proposed number of hours required to accomplish each of the Version 4 enhancements.   The fixed labor hour unit price and a total price for the offerors efforts to accomplish the requirement shall be specified.
 
5.	. Are there any other guidelines for cost proposal?
The Cost Proposal shall include all the costs as to allow the Government to determine the individual labor category breakdown and the total proposed costs for the requirement.  Please note that the Cost Proposal shall be separate from the Technical proposal which shall also include Past Performance information.

6. 	What is the place of performance?  Can the work be performed at the contractor’s facility, or must it be performed on-site at the government facility?
No facility will be furnished by the government; the contractor must provide all materials, software, and associate items.  The Government will provide only the current version of the systems which require enhancement and demonstrate the capability standards specified in the solicitation.
 
7.	. Is there an incumbent contractor for this project?  If so, can you provide any additional information about the incumbent, such as company name, location, etc?
Yes, there is an incumbent contractor is HMK Consulting, Inc.,Corvallis, OR 97330.

8.	 If there is an incumbent, is the incumbent eligible to bid on this solicitation?
Yes.

9.	 Does the project include the delivery and installation of additional software? Specifically, are the required database technologies, SQL Server and Microsoft Access, already installed and in use with the existing NOAA Fisheries website?  Also, does the existing ColdFusion Server meet your needs (is it MX or MX2004) or will an upgrade be required?
The SQL Server, Microsoft Access, and ColdFusion MX technologies are currently in use and hosted on a NOAA Fisheries server.  The server may be upgraded in the future to ColdFusion MX 2004.  The contractor shall have the equivalent software so as to develop the system and upload to the server.  

10.	 Can you provide more detail on the requirement that the "database must also be accessible using a Microsoft Access interface."  Does this process exist currently? Do you need real-time data writing capability through Access or only the ability to view data? Could a web-based reporting system potentially eliminate the need for Access?
The system administrators currently use MS Access for real-time data entry and ad-hoc reporting.

11.	Can you provide more detail on the nature of the "multiple end-of-year reports" to be submitted through the website. Do you anticipate that permit holders will upload existing reports or enter data directly into on NOAA Fisheries website, or is this undetermined?
The permit holders will be entering data directly into the website and upload the supporting documents.

12.	 Do you have a specific technology, currently in place or anticipated, for the required "merge documents" (e.g., Microsoft Word)?
We anticipate that merge documents will be in MS Word. 



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The provisions and clauses in effect are herby incorporated through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03.  This solicitation is advertised as a competitive requirement set aside for Small Businesses.   

The purpose of this solicitation is to extend the functionality of the NOAA Fisheries existing web-based application for managing Authorization and Permits for Protected Species (APPS) http://apps.nmfs.noaa.gov.  Members of the public can submit, track, and query applications online.  Permit specialists at NOAA Fisheries and the state fisheries agencies of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho manage authorizations and permits using the system.  The application has been built to handle permits and authorization required under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act.  Web and database development must use Cold Fusion MX/MX2004 and SQL Server 2000.  The database must also be accessible using a Microsoft Access interface.  The scope of this contract covers Version 4, of the application, which encompasses the below enhancements.

Enhancement Process Streamlining shall allow permit holders to submit multiple end-of-year reports on approved projects that span multiple years; allowing the entry and tracking of public comments on applications; and automatic email generation for key stages in the application process.

Improved User Interact:  Develop user help feature into a contract sensitive, database-driven user help system, allowing printing of 1—individual help pop-up items, and 2—and organized compilation of all help items.   Develop the functionality to create merge documents based on document templates and system data, for printing or off-lien editing.  Enhance ad-hoc reporting feature to include additional search fields, ability to select specific fields to show in the report, and to save report settings.  Develop a default report that generates a list of records, which allows one to see the entire record.  Develop functionality for users to download search results into spreadsheet format.

The system scope must be expanded to accommodate the major amendments to permits, which require a 30-day public comment period and the same application process as a permit.  Minor amendment to permits – processing miner change requests that are simpler then major amendments.  Additional Permit Types:  1—incidental Harassment Authorizations (IHA) and 2—Species Parts, including making requests to the Stranding Network.

Linkages shall be extended to NOAA Fisheries PCTS system.  During and after development, system maintenance is required for web page edits, error fixes, database indexing and tuning, additional fields, and enhanced security.  System documentation is required to deliver releasable code of the entire APPS application to NOAA Fisheries APPS team.  Deliver complete data dictionary and database relationship diagrams of the entire APPS application to NOAA Fisheries APPS team.  Conduct a knowledge transfer meeting with the NOAA Fisheries team.

The period of performance is for 2 years.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Evaluation Factors are based on Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  All factors are determined to be equal in weight.  Offerors are requested to send past performance of at least two references to be submitted with proposal.  The proposal shall not exceed 10 pages.  FAR provision, 52.212-3; Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items (http://www.dnb.com) , FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and conditions – Commercial Items applies to this acquisition, 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required Implementing Statues or Executive Order – Commercial Items.

Questions/Answers:

Q1) The inspection of the gearbox in most case we would replace all bearings and seal, OCE has found that some bearings could be bad or seal and gaskets would be damaged once we opened the gearbox's. This has been our standard operation for the past 10 years, could you please advise.

During the inspection the inspector must provide strong evidence to support the inspection of any gearbox. The order is only for inspections. Any repair service orders shall be contracted separately under a separate procurement. 

Q2) What is the length and height of the runways? 

A2) The site visit provided each potential offeror a clear view for the condition of the crane inspection. The information requested is not readily available.

Q3) And most important of all is there a safety line in place for our men to walk the rail? if not would we need to install one? 

A3)  OSHA provides all of the safety requirements necessary to perform a safe crane inspection. The Contractor must follow their own safety plans necessary to comply with OSHA safety standards.

Q4) If no line is to be used, is there going to room for a man-lift to perform this inspection and laser check?

A4) The Contractor shall provide all materials, equipment, and labor necessary to complete the crane inspection. The Contractor shall make their own decision for addition equipment necessary for the inspections.   

Q5) The information on the rail check is this for the bridge crane only or all monorails? If I can get the height and length of the runways for 1-4, 11-15, 18,18, 20,21, 26,27, 29, 33,34, 37, 42,43, 55-57, 67, 68 70, 76, &79

A5)  The laser check shall only be for the cranes and locations given.  The information is not readily available. The site visit provided each potential offeror an opportunity to make any necessary measurements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, Streamline Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.    This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.    This solicitation, FA8902-05-R-0004, is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).    The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03.

This requirement is for the testing of six (6) Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) handheld devices that may be used for potable water purification in field operations.  The Field Water Medic Program conducted a market survey in 2004 that identified handheld water purification devices that are commercially available.  The selected devices passed National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) Protocol (P) 231/United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) certification for removal of microbiologicals, claimed FDA approval and were close to meeting the draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD) requirements of fit, form, function.  NSF P231 is currently the only protocol that is capable of testing to the requirements for DOD handheld water purification standards for limited use.  From this study, the AF has identified six devices that warrant testing to verify that they can meet the war fighter’s requirements.    The contractor will be required to test three each of six (6) Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) devices which are identified in paragraph 5.1 on the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  The Contractor shall use a maximum of eighteen (18) devices. Testing must be done in accordance with the government approved test procedures.  This will be a firm-fixed price contract.  Quotes shall address all requirements in this combined synopsis/solicitation, and shall provide clear evidence of understanding and ability and willingness to comply with the Government’s specifications of need.    Failure to address a specification/requirement will be construed by the Government as inability to meet the need, or the offeror’s taking exception to it.    The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.    The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  price, technical capability, past performance and delivery. Vendors shall address all requirements in this combined synopsis/solicitation and shall provide clear evidence of understanding and the ability and willingness to comply with the Government’s specifications of need.
