<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends on soliciting a quotation from Lodestone Group, Inc., 188 East Cottonwood Loop, Saratoga Springs, UT on a sole source basis to provide food services for search and rescue personnel deployed at Utah National Guard, Camp Williams Barrack, Draper, UT in support to the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.  The contractor will be required to provide three hot meals daily to approximately 200 individuals stationed at Camp Williams utilizing the barrack?s existing kitchen equipment and cafeteria space.  The period of performance will be one (1) month from February 1, 2002 through February 28, 2002.  It is mandatory that the food services be provided on-site since the search and rescue personnel will be stationed at Camp Williams and the site is very remote and is occasionally inaccessible by car due to severe snow conditions.  

Pursuant to FAR 13.106-2(a)(5), the Contracting Officer has determined that Lodestone Group is the only source that can provide the required services since the firm is the current cafeteria operator for Camp Williams National Guard under another Federal contract and it would be infeasible for more than one contractor to share the same kitchen equipment and cafeteria space provided by the Government.  In addition, it would be uneconomical for another contractor to provide the required services for the limited period of performance of only one month. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

Multimodal Surface Transportation Lifeline Services and Infrastructure Assurance

DTRS56-02-BAA-0001, OPEN ANNOUNCEMENT, POC Warren Osterberg, 
(202) 366-6942.

CONTRACT INFORMATION: The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration is soliciting information and descriptions (white papers), not to exceed five pages per project, of ongoing technical or project activity addressing areas of interest described in this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). White papers must include the offeror's contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address. In addition, please indicate in a cover letter accompanying your submission if you wish to have your organization's name, white paper title, a brief synopsis (not to exceed 50 words or 5 lines), and organization website address (URL) posted on a RSPA public BAA site.  If you desire to have the information posted on the public site, please include all requested information (including the synopsis) in the cover letter.

SPECIAL NOTE:  This announcement will be open through the end of calendar year 2002, unless otherwise amended.   The purpose of the BAA is to identify and apply 1) innovative and proven products, methods, or systems that are not currently used, but have immediate potential for deployment (accelerated deployment) in transportation practice; and/or 2) new concepts for products, methods, or technologies that could protect surface transportation systems from terrorist actions and critical transportation lifeline systems to community life and commerce from service disruption.  The overall objective of the BAA is to improve the security or reduce the vulnerability of transportation services (excluding aviation) from accidental or intentional disruption. A team of government experts will review white papers monthly (at the close of each month) submitted in response to this announcement and offerors will be advised accordingly as evaluations are completed.

SCOPE:  The transportation modes within the scope of this announcement are the physical infrastructure and vehicles associated with pipelines, rail, ports and waterways, mass transit, and highways.  This announcement is not soliciting white papers on aviation security technologies.  Also, within scope are modal and intermodal freight transfer and freight transportation in trucks, ships and ports, rail systems and other commercial carriers.  Combinations of these modes and the interfaces between and among them, as well as the information infrastructure associated with their operation and control are also included.  This announcement is seeking white papers that address innovative technologies, methods and concepts (including activities) that  predict and detect security threats in multi-modal transportation services and operations. Some examples of project activities include: service disruptions to urban and intercity rail and mass transit stations and operations, service disruptions to intermodal operations, service disruptions to marine operations and ports, and surveillance of transportation systems through land and space-sensing, communications and control technologies.  

DOT is particularly interested in the following areas:  (1) risk and vulnerability assessment - new and innovative analytical techniques that might be applied to detecting potential hazards or weaknesses in the configuration of transportation;   (2) planning for transportation related contingencies - steps taken in advance that might minimize the negative effects of disruptions to transportation services; (3) innovative approaches to threat detection and evaluation - innovative technologies or approaches that might determine whether malicious disruptions to specific transportation functions

The overall objective of the contract is to further the development of rule of law in Macedonia by enabling the Macedonian judiciary to: 1) develop into a stronger, more effective and independent branch of government; 2) resolve legal disputes in a more timely, consistent and legally-correct manner and reduce case backlogs; 3) function in a more transparent, open, responsive and accountable manner; and 4) develop the capacity and mechanisms for improving court organization, practices and performance over time to meet the needs of Macedonians for timely and consistent protection of their political and economic rights.           

Specific tasks under the contract are expected to include assisting governmental and non-governmental participants in the legal system in Macedonia, as appropriate, to:

2) develop and implement, with the courts and other interested and affected parties, proactive case management practices, including  backlog reduction efforts; 

3) increase the capacity for court administration and management within the judiciary, including the creation of an administrative office for the entire court system at the national level, strengthening of court administrative and management capabilities at the appellate and basic court levels, and effectively linking together court administrators at all of these levels;

4)  through training and other means, increase the capacity of court presidents, judges and court administrators to effectively formulate and carry out organizational and procedural reforms, improve  administration and management of their courts, develop and implement better case management practices, and improve the quality of judicial decision-making;

5) increase the capacity of the current legal training institution to more effectively provide entry-level, career and continuing legal education and training to Macedonian legal professionals; and increase its capacity to become technically, managerially, and financially self-sufficient;

6) on a pilot basis, introduce computerization into selected courts and provide other equipment and court facility upgrades where necessary to enhance efficiency and increase the ability of courts to deliver legal services.

<DESC>The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for various studies and experiments to increase AFRL's knowledge and understanding of audio and speech processing technologies for support of military operations.  Solutions using new and innovative approaches are sought.  The scope of this effort covers a broad range of audio and speech processing technologies not limited to: speaker identification, language/ sublanguage (sometimes called dialect) identification, gisting (obtaining the gist of a conversation by recognition of words and phrases),  language translation, platform/background noise identification, usable speech determination, interference (noise and competing talkers) reduction, voice stress analysis, speaker verification, coding to preserve the characteristics of the talker and channel, watermarking, and correlation.    Emphasis for this research are techniques and methods for use in tactical (Avg. 9 dB signal-to-noise ratio, <5 seconds recognition time, minimum training time) military environment.  Deliverables will be technical reports, and when appropriate, demonstrations and associated data.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a five (5) to seven (7) page white paper on their proposed research topic with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, small women-owned small or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institutions. All responses to this BAA must be addressed to:  AFRL/IFEC, Attn:   John G. Parker, 32 Brooks Rd., Rome, NY    13441-4114.   Small business offerors only must also send one (1) copy of the cover letter only, by First Class mail (DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED) to AFRL/IFB, ATTN:  Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, 26  Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY   13441-4514.    The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary.  White papers must reference BAA 02-06-IFKA, and shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. Last date for submission of white papers is 30 Sep 05.  Multiple white papers addressing different areas of applicability may be submitted by each offeror and are encouraged.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.   It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  (1)  The Overall Scientific and/or Technical Merits of the Proposal, (2) Contributions to the Tactical Speech Processing mission, (3)  Innovative Approach and/or Techniques, (4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has undertaken an initiative to modernize the Filing and Payment Compliance (FPC) program.  The FPC project is a joint effort between IRS and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC, the PRIME) and is aimed at reducing the overall collection time, while improving customer and employee satisfaction.  During the strategic planning effort for transition to the Modernized Systems, it has been observed that Modernized Systems alone may not sufficiently address the large inventory of collection work.  The IRS, working together with the PRIME, has decided to perform an analysis of collection contract support options.  The collection third party contract support analysis is an analysis of best practices related to receivable management and collections.  The FPC project team will present results to IRS management of the best practices analysis, along with contract support alternatives.  The alternatives will address strategies for resolving the current collection inventory and the potential for integrated and embedded collection contract support in the modernized FPC design.  To enable the IRS/PRIME to perform an effective analysis of the options available, the IRS will issue a Request for Information (RFI).  The RFI will request information to determine what skills collection contract support companies can provide to the IRS, including training, modeling, inventory management, human resources management, software products, and collection services.  Additionally, from the information gathered, and in conjunction with a current/future state gap analysis, the IRS/PRIME will determine how to incorporate collection contract support companies as an interim solution, part of the long-term strategy, or both, as appropriate.  Specifically, the IRS/PRIME require potential collection contract support companies to provide information on a variety of issues, such as, preferred compensation methods including frequency and performance incentives.  Input on specific type of receivables most favorable to the industry practices and expected recovery rates based on delinquency amount, delinquency age, prior collection efforts, etc.  Input on a variety of security practices including personnel screening, data security, computer security and physical security capabilities.  Input on collection contract support performance measurement criteria in a balanced-measures environment, to include business results, customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction.  Input on the preferred technology and methodology for account information exchange between the IRS and collection contract support companies.  Additionally, we would like industry perspective on the impact of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, privacy and disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA98) on the collection contract support companies' ability to effectively assist the IRS in its collection activities.  The IRS/PRIME will review written responses to the RFI for parties demonstrating experience with projects of similar scope and magnitude, or parties with unique and unusual solutions to a variety of the requested data elements on which we are gathering information.   The IRS/PRIME will identify two or three collection service providers to partner with the IRS/PRIME as we design the future IRS Filing and Payment Compliance model.  The IRS/PRIME is primarily interested in selecting companies that have a high level of expertise, broad subject matter coverage, and a willingness to dedicate individuals to assist the IRS/PRIME as needed.  The identified companies will be requested to participate in informal meetings with the IRS/PRIME periodically over the next several months as Subject Matter Experts (SME's).  The IRS/PRIME will ask the SME's to assist the IRS by providing the private sector input from a collection services provider perspective as we further refine the decision analytics for case assignment, as well

2.	This combined synopsis/solicitation (232-02-0004) is amended to add the following language concerning delivery of responses:
	
	Because of the increased security at Federal buildings, please allow extra time for your proposal to be delivered to the Contracting Office provided in the combined synopsis/solicitation.  Failure to use the specified address could result in your proposal being delivered late.  Due to security concerns, hand carried proposal will not be accepted.

3.	Offerors responding to this combined synopsis/solicitation (232-02-0004) must acknowledge receipt of this amendment in their response.
								
4.	This amendment transmits the following Industry Questions and Government Responses:

	Q1.	Is there an incumbent on this project?

	A1.	No, not for the entire project.  We have multiple providers doing pieces of the work described in the statement of work. 

	Q2.	Is this a new project or has this project existed before this solicitation?

	A2.	Refer to the response to Q1, above.  This project has existed in several pieces.  The goal of this statement of work is to consolidate all the pieces together, and have one contractor provide all services.

	Q3.	Statement Of Work, Purpose, says that "The purpose of this project is to provide health promotion/health information with paper and online HRA service to FOH's customers via the internet.  The contractor shall provide a website..."Is it FOH's expectation that a contractor has a pre-existing website that can be customized to meet the proposed specifications of this website, or does FOH expect the contractor to develop this website from scratch and in consultation with FOH staff after award of a contract?

	A3.	This is commercial purchase.   The contractor will need to have a pre-existing website which may be customized with FOH logos.

	Q4.	Statement Of Work , Specific Tasks/Duties, Part A.1. says that "The contractor shall provide health information, tools for personal health management, and up-to-date medical news...."  Will FOH be providing this "health information...and up-to-date medical news" for display on the website, or is the contractor responsible for researching and providing this information at its discretion?

	A4.	FOH would not be posting information on the website.  The contractor would be responsible for posting information and having information verified by qualified medical professionals.

	Q5.	Statement Of Work, Specific Tasks/Duties, Part A.2. says that the contractor shall provide this website from their own server..."  Does FOH have an existing website on its server or will the contractor be designing and developing this website?

	A5.	Refer to the response to Q3, above.  This is an off the shelf commercial buy, the website should already be available.  FOH has a website, but would not host this project.  This would be hosted on contractor's website.

	Q6.	Statement of Work, Specific Tasks/Duties, Part B.2. says that "The contractor shall..." but then continues with "All data shall be categorized by the FOH customer...."  Can you please clarify this requirement?

	A6.	FOH wants usage results and individual data and subgroups (for example agency customer reports)  to be summarized in a report by subgroups, using a coding system for FOH.

	Q7.	Statement of Work, Specific Tasks/Duties, Part C. says that "The contractor's website shall..."  Is it FOH's expectation that a contractor already has this type of website in existence, or is this question referring to a website that the contractor shal

Online Interactive Office Ergonomics Training Program
Amendment Number 2

1.	The DATE and TIME for submission of responses to this combined synopsis/solicitation is extended to January 7, 2002 at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

2.	This combined synopsis/solicitation (232-02-0001) is amended to add the following language concerning delivery of responses:
	
	Because of the increased security at Federal buildings, please allow extra time for your proposal to be delivered to the Contracting Office provided in the combined synopsis/solicitation.  Failure to use the specified address could result in your proposal being delivered late.  Due to security concerns, hand carried proposal will not be accepted.

3.	Offerors responding to this combined synopsis/solicitation ( 232-02-0001) must acknowledge receipt of this amendment in their response.

4.	 This amendment transmits the following Industry Questions and Government Responses:


	Q1.	The RFP speaks of an anticipated maximum.  Can FOH guarantee a minimum number of users?  If so, what are the minimum for year 1, 2 and 3?

	A1.	The Federal Government is the largest employer in the United States.  Federal Occupational Health (FOH), a full service occupational health Federal agency, has a mission to assist Federal agencies in identifying and addressing their ergonomics needs.  This is a voluntary process whereby through Interagency Agreements agencies reimburse FOH for its rendered services.  Agencies are not mandated to provide ergonomics services to their employees.

		At this time, several agencies (with various population sizes) have expressed an interest in web based Office Ergonomics Training and are awaiting further details regarding subject content, costs, date of availability, etc.  Since specific Interagency Agreements for this type of training have not been signed due to the unavailability of the information required (especially costs), FOH cannot guarantee a minimum number of users at this time nor for option years 2 and 3.  We can only speculate that once the product is available at a reasonable cost, there will be a significant interest in agencies providing it to their employees.  It should also be noted, that FOH plans to vigorously market web based Office Ergonomics Training product to agencies through the FOH marketing team.


	Q2.	Will there be one FOH site from which all Federal agencies will log into (one setup with reporting options to allow for the separation of agencies)?

	A2.	Yes.  There will be one FOH site for agencies to log onto.  Agency authorized users will complete an FOH Assessment and then be hyperlinked to the contractor?s website.  They can only be hyperlinked after completing the FOH Assessment.  FOH will have its own file for each agency.

		When a user links from the FOH website to the contractor website, FOH can attach parameters to the URL which will: (1) identify that the user originated from the FOH website; and (2) pass other relevant information (name, agency) to the contractor website.  Details of what information can/will be passed will be subject to negotiation with the successful contractor and FOH staff.

	Q3.	Will FOH purchase a certain quantity of user licenses from the contractor and then sell chunks of those licenses to various agencies?

	A3.	FOH plans to provider user access to the training following the completion of individual Interagency Agreements.  The number of licenses purchased will depend upon the number authorized in each Interagency Agreement.

	Q4.	Will FOH negotiate access with larger groups (i.e., agencies or parts of agencies) or will they allow individual access from various agencies, without negotiating for a larger rollout within that given agency?

	A4.	FOH will market agencies for the largest number of user

The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI1002 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 97-27.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisitions procedures with Roche Diagnostics of Indianapolis, ID for twenty-three (23) each of Hepatitis C Virus Monitor 2.0 Assay Kits, Catalogue Number 87024.

These kits will be used to perform immunological tests to detect, analyze and quantify markers of hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus on a wide variety of specimens.

<DESC>NA The Army intends to negotiate a modification with San Juan Construction, Inc. under Contract No. DACA83-01-C-0040, FY01 RDT&E IFICS Data Terminal Facility, U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA).  A Justification & Approval citing U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Re sponsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, has been approved.  The work involves  procurement and installation of a Fenwall FM 200 gaseous fire suppression system.  The Fire and Emergency Services at USAKA currentl y service 68 different FM 200 (Fenwal brand) locations within USAKA.  They currently have three trained fire alarm technicians who are familiar with the testing and servicing requirements of the FM 200 systems.  They have FM 200 spare parts on-island and h ave the knowledge required to order any required parts. Kwajalein is a remote installation located approximately 2,100 miles southwest of Honolulu.  Support of multiple fire suppression systems similar to FM 200 would greatly complicate their maintenance a nd repair and increase costs to the U.S. Government.  Specifying FM 200 would save the government money by eliminating the need to maintain and repair multiple systems at this remote installation. The cost of maintaining and repairing multiple systems such  as FM 200 would be a substantial duplication of cost that the government would not likely recover through competition.  San Juan Construction, Inc., the proposed sole source contractor, currently has the construction contract with the U.S. Army Corps of E ngineers.  The estimated cost of the proposed modification is between $200,000 to $300,000.  See Note 22.

[The RFP will result in the award of up to six (6) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs); up to three under full and open competition, two under a partial set-aside for small business concerns, and one under a set-aside for small disadvantaged business (8[a]) concerns]. Today the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development office assists the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging issues where gender is a key concern.
