Standardization Program to Improve the Clinical Measurement of Glycohemoglobin.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been and is actively represented on the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) Steering Committee, which has a critical role in the operation of the program.   Of major interest to CDC is the established primary reference method, the availability of QC and reference materials, and comparative performance data analysis.   CDC, Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences has been funded and charged with the task to improve diagnostic care for diabetes.  Specific goals include providing improved measurement of GHB testing through long term standardization of current and emerging test methods, developing a definitive reference method for HbA1c, and developing methods and interventions for improved care of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The purpose of this project is to establish and operate a standardization program for glycohemoglobin (GHB) testing so that clinical laboratory results are comparable to those values reported in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).   

The contractor is required to: (1) establish and maintain the DCCT primary reference method; (2) establish a network of reference laboratories, all of which maintain reference methods or precise methods traceable to the reference method;  (3) monitor Network Laboratories monthly to meet monitoring criteria; (4) interact with manufacturers of GHB methods through the Network, providing assistance in standardizing their methods and then providing comparison data for certification of traceability to the DCCT; (5) provide assessment of effectiveness of the program through evaluation of independent Proficiency Testing data from College of American Pathologists (CAP); (6) provide data and reference materials to assist CDC in the development of definitive reference method; (7) establish and maintain a C-peptide standardization program for select laboratories following guidelines provided. 

Award of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 is contemplated. There will be a base period of performance of 12 months and four option periods of performance of 12 months each.  The total base and option periods shall not exceed 60 months.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration hereby makes notice of a proposed contract action under solicitation number 223-04-2507, “Food Source Identification and Tracking System”, for the following:

(1) A predictive modeling tool that is capable of generating various permutations (simulations) to food safety emergencies (both unintentional and intentional). It will be based upon the complex systems involved in food production. This modeling tool should be able to project outcomes and their probabilities in terms of the likely distribution of human illness or death and economic consequences, based on assumptions about the underlying food adulteration event before its true nature is known. These assumptions should easily accommodate modifications. Events to be modeled will need to be able to incorporate different methods of intervention, times of intervention, and points in the food production and distribution chain at which the intervention is applied. This tool will be based upon complex systems predictive (mathematical) modeling that does not require real-time network connectivity or inputs and will tool serve as a predictive modeling instrument and not an IT system. The mathematical substructure of the tool may be based upon a tool (theory) already in existence (and modified as needed).  

(2) Identification of the data requirements constitutes an essential part of supporting such a predictive modeling tool. Once the modeling tool is conceptualized and designed, it is important that its data requirements be described and a determination made as to the feasibility of how these requirements can be met. It should be determined if existing data sources are available and can be made accessible to support the modeling tool. It should be determined if additional data sources will need to be articulated and developed. Conceivably, such data requirements may include a mechanism for enhancing industry’s and FDA’s ability to trace foods through the entire food chain, especially when food is suspected/implicated as the intentional or accidental vehicle for the transmission of a human pathogen or a toxic material.  Development of such a tool and the utilization of such data will facilitate a rapid and effective response by government and industry to an intentional or unintentional food safety emergency so illness, death, and economic impact are minimized. Data needs and requirements in any predictive modeling tool, as in this one, are dynamic over time. This fluidity should be taken into consideration during data needs assessment and reporting. 

(3) The ability to easily incorporate data into tool, modify data in tool, or change data in tool is required to fully utilize this tool. This step is dependent upon both previous steps and should be planned accordingly. As data is identified, a plan will be developed for this incorporation or use, depending upon need and data structure.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The solicitation will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov for downloading on or about fifteen (15) calendar days after publication of this announcement with proposals due approximately 30 calendar days later. THE SOLICITATION WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR COMPETITION AMONG SMALL BUSINESSES. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation, attachments and amendments. It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor the FedBizopps web page for the release of the solicitation and any amendments. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act upon request. Award is anticipated mid- to late September, 2004 or sooner.

<DESC>Attention: General Contractors, Mechanical Subcontractors, Plumbing Subcontractors, Electrical Subcontractors, Elevator Subcontractors, Pre-Cast Panel Fabricator/Erectors, Cab-Glass Glazing Subcontractors and Manufacturers. The FAA has a requirement for construction of an Airport Traffic Control Tower (ACTC) at the Phoenix Deer Valley Municipal Airport (DVT) Phoenix, AZ.  The project involves construction of an ATCT measuring 144' to the top of cab with structural precast panels on a mat foundation.   The scope of work also includes an attached 5,000 square foot base building, emergency generator building, entrance road, utilities, parking lot, and security systems. This project will be awarded using a best-value procurement process called the Performance Information Procurement System (PIPS).  Under this process, award will be made to that Offeror whose offer within the Governmentâ€™s budget of $7.8 million is determined to provide the greatest overall value to the FAA.  Best value will be based on performance, to include past performance of the prime (general) contractor and critical subcontractors (listed above), current performance capability, and price.  An educational workshop will be held to discuss the PIPS process and project requirements.  This workshop is mandatory for the prime (general) contractor.  All other vendors and individuals (site superintendents and project managers) are highly encouraged to attend to understand the project and how the award will be made.  The workshop will be held from 9:00 am â€“ 12:00 noon, November 4, 2004 at a place to be determined in the greater Phoenix area.  Interested vendors should RSVP via email to Contracting Officer Gerald Boyer at gerald.boyer@faa.gov no later than October 28, 2004.   Please provide the name(s) of the attendees, phone number(s), email addresses, and your area of expertise. Please CC John Savicky at john.savicky@asu.edu  (A map will be provided to vendors that RSVP.) Please note: This is neither a request for offers nor for capability statements.  However, the FAA reserves the right to no longer consider firms that fail to respond, to this announcement, respond incompletely or provide any information found to be verifiably false.  Details of the remaining phase(s) of this process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this public announcement.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for support to the MSFC Operations Integration Office for advanced concept and system definition and study.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Computer Sciences Corporation as a sole source procurement for operations integration support to Constellation transportation systems definition and Constellation system engineering and integration activities, which are already in progress using a small team of MSFC and CSC personnel.   Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1) the operations support to the above described activities relies heavily upon processes and technical expertise obtained during the Orbital Space Plan program and further adapted to support ongoing Constellation activities and 2) because the specific expertise gained in the prior months cannot be duplicated or communicated to another vendor quickly, only CSC can provide the effort necessary to support near term deliveries without impact to schedule.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Kimberly J. Adams, PS53, via email Kimberly.J.Adams@nasa.gov not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on October 21, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle), in connection with Battelle’s operation and maintenance of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) at Richland, Washington under Contract No. DE-AC05-76RL01830 has need for a Professional Design Team (PDT) to provide campus master planning, programming and conceptual design for four (4) replacement facilities which will be used to consolidate multi-functional research capabilities currently located in the 300 area of the Hanford Site.  The replacement (new) facilities as currently envisioned total approximately 500,000 gross square feet.  The Richland campus and Battelle’s relationship with DOE and PNNL is unique because of Battelle’s 1831 Use Permit with DOE.  Portions of the Richland campus (land and facilities) are owned by Battelle, portions are government owned and belong to the PNNL and portions are jointly shared.  It is anticipated that the replacement facilities will be sited on the Richland campus.  

The successful PDT will be required to update and integrate the existing Richland campus master plan to include these new facilities, considering the environment, energy, economy, community, life cycle, sustainability and campus infrastructure.  Sustainability and energy efficiency shall be expressed as a target score range of the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED Rating System, Version 2.1, May 2003 Edition, or another nationally recognized standard.

PNNL has developed general requirements for these replacement facilities through prior conceptual programming studies and will make these requirements available to the successful PDT.  Some limited interviews with stakeholders are anticipated in order to complete the campus planning and facility programming.  The PDT’s final programming documents need to be developed and detailed to the extent necessary to support definitive design of the new facilities without any further design planning.  
SELECTION 
A.	Qualifications Based Selection:  Battelle uses a qualifications based selection process by which contracts for PDT services are negotiated on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of professional services required at a fair and reasonable price.  A Source Selection Panel appointed specifically for this acquisition will review, evaluate, score and rank all submittals to identify the 3 – 5 most highly qualified firms.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) intends to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) not to exceed $25,000 for Information Technology (IT) on site training as described below.  Proposals are being requested by October 14.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Orders will be placed against this BPA via the U.S. Department of Labor Training Authorization and Evaluation Form DL 1-101.  The vendor will provide the BLS with the following training as required:  

  --  IN SEARCH OF EXCELLENT REQUIREMENTS:  
The 2-day seminar will describe tested methods that can help an organization improve the  way it elicits, analyzes, documents, verifies, and manages software requirements.  Characteristics of excellent requirements statements and requirements specifications will be presented and used to evaluate some sample functional requirements.  The seminar will emphasize several practical techniques including:  (1) creating an effective customer-developer partnership; (2) customer involvement through a "product champion" model; (3) application of use cases for defining user needs and system functions; (4) simple model for prioritizing requirements; (5) writing software requirements specifications using a standard template; (6) constructing dialog maps to model user interfaces, as well as other analysis models; (7) use of prototypes to clarify and refine user needs; (8) use of technical reviews and inspections to find requirements errors; and (8) use of a requirements traceability matrix to connect requirements to design elements, code, and tests.  The basic concepts of requirements management will be described as well as practical methods for managing changes to requirements.  These techniques can reduce project risk by improving the quality and control of the software requirements, thereby increasing the likelihood of a successfully completed project.  A blend of lecture, class discussion, group discussions on requirements problems and solutions, and practice sessions will be utilized.  Practice sessions will especially give attendees some experience in working with use cases, drawing a dialog map, reviewing a requirements specification, writing good requirements, and writing an action plan to improve their group's requirements practices.

<SUBJECT>58--HIGH DATA RATE-RADIO FREQUENCY (HDR-RF) CAPABILITY AND MODEM
<SOLNBR>ESC-NI4M-HDR-RF-001
<CONTACT>Frank Holmes Frank.Holmes@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Force is looking for technical expertise and products that will enable the start of the development of an HDR Ground capability in FY05, with an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY08 to compliment the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite 4 (WGS4) launch in FY09.  An HDR modem is required to support both ground to air and ground-to-space communications for Tactical Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft and Command and Control (C2) aircraft. This modem must be compliant with Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) architecture version 3.0.  In addition to the waveforms associated with WGS satellites, the modem must be able to support, through SCA reprogramability, future Transformational Satellite (TSAT) waveforms. The HDR modem must achieve a variable data rate capability up to 274 Mbps (at least for the receiving end).  The modem must have enough processing capability to achieve these data rates in the presence of turbo decoders. The HDR modem will be based upon open, industry standard interfaces and will be controlled and monitored from a variety of existing and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) applications. This RFI will be used by ESC/NI4 in the development of an acquisition strategy for an HDR-RF ground capability. The Air Force is seeking industry’s help in determining the optimum approach to achieving a Tactical Ground capability of operating at the high data rate described above. Both, the option to integrate HDR-RF modem capabilities into an existing ground satellite Non-Developmental Item (NDI) terminals and the development of a new terminal with the enhanced capability should be explored. Your rationale for the preferred approach would be a key element in the development of our acquisition strategy. See attached HDR-RF CAM RFI (1 Sep 2004) for more information.

<CONTACT>Nicholas Doucakis nicholas.doucakis@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The application is for a HDR RF ground capability for ground-to-space communication.  An appropriate antenna system is needed to support this HDR-RF ground capability.  This antenna system will transmit and receive up to 274 Mbps via the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS) utilizing its Ka frequency band (31/21.2 GHz), in an expected channelizer bypass mode, and eventually the Ka band on Transformational Satellites (TSat).  Additionally, this capability will need to support the Extremely High Frequency (EHF) frequency band (45.5/21.2 GHz) on Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and TSat systems.<br><br> Two (2) antennas are being solicited for the antenna system.  The main differences between the two antennas are their G/T and EIRP requirements (ref table below).  The table also provides other detailed antenna performance requirements.  Each antenna must support multiple carrier operations.  The HDR-RF ground antennas are expected to be controlled by and monitored from a variety of existing and future DoD SATCOM terminals. The Government is looking to begin development of a HDR RF ground capability in FY05, with an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY08 to synchronize with the WGS Flight 4 launch in FY09.<br><br> See attached HDR-RF RFI (5 Sep 2004) for more information.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard Research & Development Center intends to negotiate and award a sole-source contract to Systems Planning & Analysis, Inc. (SPA), Alexandria, VA to provide follow-on services and support for continued analysis work and development of the General Campaign Analysis Model (GCAM) Dual Sector Simulation (DSS).  The GCAM DSS model is based on a unique variant of the General Campaign Analysis Model - Core Tool Suite (GCAM-CTS).  The GCAM-CTS is proprietary software developed and maintained by SPA.  The DSS uses advanced GCAM modeling techniques and modifications to the GCAM-CTS necessary to support Coast Guard (CG) sector level Wide Area Surveillance/Maritime Domain Awareness (WAS/MDA) analytic requirements.  The GCAM DSS encompasses unique tactical and operational elements required to analyze: Coast Guard missions; present homeland security maritime domain awareness (MDA) capabilities; potential future surveillance capabilities; and notional MDA Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) architectures.  The CG R&DC has successfully demonstrated the GCAM DSS as a means to conduct detailed mission effectiveness studies of proposed WAS/MDA technologies within needed time frames.  The requirement is to support rapid modification and adaptation of the GCAM DSS to conduct trade-off analyses for different operational and technology alternatives relating to WAS/MDA. Addressing near and long-term CG and Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency WAS/MDA analysis requirements will necessitate further use and development of the GCAM DSS and the GCAM-CTS. Therefore, expertise in the GCAM-CTS, the GCAM DSS application, and the ability to modify their core functions to rapidly adapt to new WAS/MDA analysis efforts is pivotal for success.

The Coast Guard intends to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee provision.  The period of performance is two (2) years.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement to the above address. For information concerning this solicitation, please contact the contracting officer cited below.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement(s). To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil.  See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) of the National Cancer Institute is re-competing a contract for support for interdisciplinary studies, NO2-CP-91026, currently held by Westat, Inc.  The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international family studies and field (case-control and cohort) studies.  Although the scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the Genetic Epidemiology Branch professional staff, the major activities of the contract provide:  1) nursing support including contacting family members, explaining the studies, enrolling family members, obtaining clinical information and records, requesting pathology slides for diagnosis confirmation, arranging for family members to be evaluated by GEB investigators in the Cancer Genetics Clinic at the Clinical Center, performing phlebotomy, obtaining other biologic specimens as necessary, arranging and conducting field trips to evaluate family members, verifying information for the family registry database, maintaining tracking systems for data and biologic specimens, developing and providing educational materials for participants, and participating in genetic counseling and risk notification; 2) maintenance of a locked medical record room to which GEB investigators have immediate access;  3) development of coordination and liaison at a local or international level with collaborating investigators or institutions whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of a study;  4) assistance in the design and pilot testing of forms required for field investigations (e.g., questionnaires, abstracting forms, coding forms, manuals for field procedures and other documents); 5) hiring, training and supervision of field personnel (interviewers, abstractors, and others); 6) identification of study subjects, including locating cancer patients and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files; 
7) supervision and management of field operations;  8) collections of data (interviewing/record abstraction, biologic specimen collection and processing); 9) data reduction activities (coding, keying, and editing) of data collected into a format suitable for computer analysis; 10) quality control and standardization so that appropriate and valid data result.  The maintenance of s secure record room which allows GEB investigators access to the medical records within 15 minutes is a mandatory requirement.  There is also a mandatory requirement of the capability of nearly daily face to face meetings with the GEB staff.  It is anticipated that one incrementally funded, cost-reimbursement, term type contact will be awarded for a period of five years, with a required total level of effort of 160,000 direct labor hours. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be available on or about November 5, 2004 with responses due within 30 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP.

The solicitation will be made available to the public via posting on FEDBIZOPs.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Agency, all such offers must be received by the date specified in the solicitation to be eligible for consideration.

<DESC>Request for Proposals (RFP) N01-CN-55006-72, entitled: Preclinical Efficacy and Intermediate Endpoint Assays. The mission of the Chemopreventive Agent Development Research Group, Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), National Cancer Institute is to identify safe and effective agents for the prevention of human cancers and to develop and qualify these agents for clinical trials. The DCP is seeking proposals from qualified organizations that have the ability to establish the efficacy of potential cancer preventive agents or agent combinations in a variety of in vivo assays, to identify and validate surrogate intermediate endpoints for clinical trial use, and to establish collaborative groups to conduct these studies. The studies will assess the potential of various agents to inhibit, reverse, or delay early carcinogenesis by evaluating the effects of these selected agents on a variety of cancers and endpoints, measuring cancer incidence, multiplicity, tumor size and latency. In addition other studies would address the identification and validation of surrogate intermediate endpoints in animal models for use in clinical trials. The agents to be studied shall include agents developed by the pharmaceutical and other industries and provided to the NCI for collaborative development as well as commercially available agents, agents developed by the NCI, and agents nominated by academic investigators through the RAPID program (http://www.cancer.gov/prevention/rapid/) The specific goals of this RFP are: 1) To establish the efficacy of potential cancer preventive agents (or combinations of agents) in various in vivo carcinogenesis assays, measuring the inhibition, reversal, or delay of the carcinogenesis process and, 2) To identify and validate surrogate intermediate biomarkers for future use in clinical trials using in vivo assays of experimental carcinogenesis. Contracts will be awarded to the offerors who demonstrate the ability to conduct both efficacy and intermediate endpoint bioassays of potential cancer preventive agents in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations Good Laboratory Practices Act and other regulations applicable to pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement / nutriceutical product development and commercialization. Offerors must demonstrate that they have knowledge of drug development, preferably in disease prevention, and expertise in laboratory animal cancer chemoprevention bioassay methods and intermediate endpoint biological, molecular assay, or imaging techniques. Offerors need to provide evidence of their own expertise and access to expertise in such areas as molecular biology, pathology, imaging, statistical analyses, analytical chemistry, and other potentially relevant laboratory methodologies. Offerors must submit a proposal that addresses both task areas, that is, Preclinical Efficacy and Intermediate Endpoint Assays. Only those proposals from offerors who demonstrate the capability to perform both Preclinical Efficacy and Intermediate Endpoint Assays will be considered for potential award. Contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation will replace the current Efficacy Studies of Chemopreventive Agents in Animal Models and Preclinical Evaluation of Intermediate and their Modulation by Chemopreventive Agents Master Agreement Pools. Multiple prime contracts will be awarded on a cost-reimbursement completion type basis, with managed Work Assignments.  Currently, awards have been made to Fox Chase Cancer Center, N01-CN-43309 and Washington University, N01-CN-43308.  The purpose of this solicitation is to add additional prime contractors. It is anticipated that up to 1-2 awards may be made and that these contracts will be incrementally-funded with a period of performance of four (4) years. The Project Officer will initiate Work Assignments which are then forwarded to the Principal Investigator stating the Period of Performance, specific work to be performed and deliverables. Within a specified period the contractor will submit to the Project Officer a detailed description of the technical approach and an estimate of the required costs and effort. The costs of a Work Assignment will not exceed the funds currently allocated for this contract. With the concurrence of the Project Officer and approval by the Contracting Officer, the Work Assignment shall commence. Offerors will have the flexibility to subcontract with additional vendors to provide specific technical expertise that is needed for the individual Work Assignments. The duration of each study will depend on the intermediate biomarker assay or the laboratory animal model and will be specified in each Work Assignment. The contractor selected shall be responsible for providing the chemopreventive agent except in instances when the NCI wants an agent tested that may not be available to the contractor. In such cases, the Government shall bear the expense of providing an agent. The specific work assignment shall specify whether the contractor shall be expected to provide the agent. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710. The RFP will be issued ELECTRONICALLY on or about October 19, 2004.  The RFP will be available on the Research Contracts Branch (RCB) web site at: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/

<DESC>Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) and the Air Force Mobility Command (AMC) is pleased to announce the release of the Air Force and the Army Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix, New Jersey. Please note that "Step One" proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time 8 November 2004, at the offices of Jones Lang LaSalle.  The Air Force intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix project.  The Air Force, with the technical assistance of Jones Lang LaSalle, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the project.  In the second step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  The Air Force, with the technical assistance of Jones Lang LaSalle, will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force Selection Authority.  McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix Project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,435 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,435 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,364 housing units, secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the SO.  The Government may, consistent with the limitations set forth in the RFP, subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror.  The SO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix military family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The RFP is available at http://www.jllpsc.com/.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) and associated orders to General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Fairfax, VA, 22033, to complete the UML Domain Model effort to extend a computational Platform Independent Model (PIM) of the E-2C Operational flight Program, based on the HE2K SCS ’04 build.  The model was begun under a previous effort.  NAVAIR intends to negotiate a BOA containing Firm Fixed Price and Cost Reimbursable CLINs.  This action, and its associated orders,  will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. NAVAIR believes that the Government would be subjected to a duplication of the substantial costs associated with previous efforts, costs that could not be recovered through competition, along with unacceptable delays totalling more than a year, in order to obtain these highly specialized services.  The Primary POC is David Hackett, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-7029, Fax 301-757-7054, email David.Hackett@navy.mil.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This requirement is offered to all qualified, responsive, concerns and offers will be considered using the CASCADING ORDER OF PREFERENCE.  Each tier will be evaluated using the procedure outlined below.  A determination of insufficient competition or unreasonable price will be made before the next tier is evaluated.

FIRST TIER, it is the intent of the Government to award one contract on a competitive basis to a Section 8(a) business concern in accordance with FAR 19.8, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at a fair market price.  Competitive among 8(a) concerns is limited to the State of Oklahoma.

LAST TIER, if circumstances do not permit an 8(a) award, the responsive offeror(s) from the first tier will be included in the evaluation of the last tier.  The Government intends to award a contract on a competitive basis to an eligible HubZone business concern in accordance with FAR 19.13, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at a fair market price.

Adequate competition is defined as at least two (2) competitive offerors from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration.

It is anticipated that the Government will award a Firm, Fixed Price contract requiring the prime contractor to do at least 25% of the work.

Solicitation documents will be available for downloading from the internet on or about October 14, 2004.  The solicitation and related documents, including drawings, will be available on the internet to contractors meeting the size and registration requirements.

DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.  NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:  Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:  

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and (c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, (d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.  

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.   

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Teaming Opportunity for the Instument Incubator Program (IIP) NRA which was posted on September 28, 2004. You are notified that the following additional technical requirements are added. UV Ozone Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) System Technical POC: Russell DeYoung, (757)864-1472, email, Russell.J.DeYoung@nasa.gov We are considering a proposal to develop and test a UV ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system for deployment on an unpiloted atmospheric vehicle (UAV). We are interested in partnering with others that have technical expertise in either or both of the following capabilities. 1)	Develop, test and deliver a diode pumped Nd:YAG laser system that would produce 50-100 watts, 50-100 mJ/pulse with a single longitutudinal mode. The fundamental would be converted at high efficiency to 355 nm.  This pump laser would be ruggedized for potential UAV deployment. 2).  Develop, test and deliver a UV converter that would accept the 355nm output from the pump laser and convert it to tunable UV radiation in either of two wavelength bands 308-320 nm or 285-311 nm. This converter would be ruggedized for potential deployment on a UAV for ozone measurements.  Both the pump laser and UV converter would be integrated into an existing receiver subsystem  resulting in an operational ozone DIAL system for UAV deployment. Carbon Observation Spectrometer Imagery Technical POC: Daniel K. Zhou, (757)864-5663, email, Daniel.K.Zhou@nasa.gov We are proposing to develop an infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometer Imagery instrument with ultra-hyperspectral resolution to monitor carbon (e.g., CO and CO2) distribution in the lower troposphere using a geosynchronous satellite.  As such we are seeking partners to help design and develop an instrument. The due date for responses is not extended.

<DESC>The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has developed a simplified design and process for nitrogen oxides (NOx) reduction at fossil-energy-fired power plants, which greatly reduces the amounts of ammonia required in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) NOx control systems.  This new design and process reduces costs, equipment requirements, the need for ammonia storage, and operating risks.   
  
INEEL is presently seeking interest from qualified industrial firms to undertake a new research and development project that will focus on the design and fabrication of a small-scale prototype system that demonstrates the ability to greatly reducing the amount of ammonia required for NOx reduction in a power plant.   The NOx reduction project will seek to reduce the capital costs of current operating fossil-energy-fired power plants using SCR NOx control systems.  The development project will culminate with deployment and demonstration of a prototype system.  

The INEEL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in this project.  It is anticipated that the project will be carried out through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with funding and “in-kind” support being provided by the participant(s).  Interested parties should respond on or before December 6, 2004.

If no response is received by 13 October 2004,  04:00PM, MST, to the effect that comparable support services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with Environmental Tectonics, a sole source award will be made.

<SUBJECT>D -- Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS)
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) is contemplating entering into a sole source contract with IBM Global Services, Inc. for application engineering and technical support services for its Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS).  This action represents a continuation of service beyond the limit of the existing DADS contract options until a full and open competition is conducted and a contract for the follow-on Integrated Dissemination System (IDS) program is awarded.  The current contract expires on June 30, 2005.  The DADS program has been developed and maintained by IBM for the past seven years. This sole source contract will be for a period of up to 27 months in order to complete the RFP for IDS, run a full and open competition on IDS, and allow a transition period.  It is the USCB's belief that IBM is the only capable source to provide DADS services within the required timeframe at an acceptable level of risk and cost to continue data dissemination operations until the IDS vendor is selected.  Interested companies having the capability to provide the above-described services should submit, via email, their capability statement to eric.wayne.franklin@census.gov or fax to 301-457-8465 within 15 days of this notice.  Interested companies may view the Statement of Work for FY2005 of the current contract at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/ids/ids.html.  While this is not a request for competitive proposals, responses received within 15 days from the posting of this notice will be reviewed and evaluated for technical merit.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of the statements received in response to this notice, however the statements will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the USCB.  If no responses are received, a sole source contract with IBM for a one-year base period with options for up to an additional 15 months will be pursued without further notice.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intention to Renew Birth Verification Services
<DESC>Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Center for Federal Investigative Services (CFIS) intends to renew sole-source agreements for Birth Verification Search (BVS) services to State Health Agencies  throughout the Country.  The States provide detailed birth verification data to be utilized in analyzing investigative information for security and suitability adjudication. The information provided under this service contains information available only to other Government agencies. Therefore, the States are the intended source for these services. Under these anticipated agreements each contract action is not expected to exceed $100,000. OPM CFIS deems it appropriate to award fixed-price agreements on other than a full and open competitive basis to State Health Agencies. Only State Health Agencies are the available responsible sources and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Agency. The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 519120 - Libraries and Archives. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.

<DESC>BAA-Number 05-01-JT2 			A-Research & Development
Contracting Office Address
The Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002.

Description

Virginia Contracting Activity is soliciting White Papers for innovative approaches and concepts to obtain unique and creative solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches within five unclassified MASINT technical thrust areas: Radar, Electro-Optic, Material, Geo-physical, and Radio frequency (RF).  Six classified technical mission area descriptions will be provided to prospective offerors possessing the required level of clearance.  This MASINT Transitional BAA is structured to satisfy six classified MASINT mission areas through Research and Development within the five unclassified MASINT technical thrust areas.  Concept White Papers should explore and quantify improvements in the primary areas of: Radar, Electro-Optic (Infrared Spectral sensing lasers), Material (chemical and biological), Geo-physical (seismic, acoustic and magnetic monitoring) and Radio Frequency (unintentional emanations).  The White Papers are to use the unclassified MASINT thrust areas to satisfy the six classified mission areas.  The Program Office’s primary mission is to conduct detailed technical target studies and lead development of transformational MASINT technologies from development through end-to-end operational transition, using a disciplined approach that fosters innovation and reduced cycle time.  In short, they develop and operationally demonstrate MASINT technology.

Government POCs: Contracting Officer: Ms. Jody Tully, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002, telephone: (321) 494-9739, email: jody.tully@patrick.af.mil; Program Manager: Major Frank Barrow, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002, telephone: 321-494-4648, email: frankin.barrow@patrick.af.mil; Technical Director: Mr. Steve Gotoff, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002, telephone: 321-494-3277, email: steven.gotoff@patrick.af.mil. Contractors should contact Ms. Jody Tully at 321-494-9739 to request classified data. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.   Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a two (2) to four (4) page White Paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution for the relevant mission areas(s). The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  The White Paper should include the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  It is a best guess of the anticipated cost of the effort.  The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed.  The White Paper does not include a cost proposal.  It must include a short technical description of the concepts and planned approach to accomplish an operational demonstration and the technical objectives.  It briefly describes the technologies to be pursued in the effort.  The White Paper must also include past performance data, in accordance with the attached instructions.  

White Papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the invitation to submit a proposal.

This MASINT Transitional BAA is open and effective for a period of four years from the date of release (estimated Oct 04-Oct 08).  It is recommended that White Papers be received by May of each year to maximize the possibility of award.  White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available late in each respective Government Fiscal Year.  The cost of preparing Government requested proposals, in response to this announcement, is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. 

WHITE PAPER FORMAT: The White Paper must be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Company Name, Period of Performance, Estimated Cost of Task; Section B: Task Objective and Relevant Mission areas(s) being addressed; and Section C: Technical Summary of Objectives and the Operational Demonstration.  Multiple White Papers, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by offerors.  All White Papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12-pitch.  Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a), and in accordance with the approved MASINT-Related RDT&E Activities Security Classification Guide, Feb 03.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address (both unclassified and classified if available) with their submission. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to: Jody Tully, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002.

CRITERIA: The evaluation of White Papers and proposals will be performed utilizing the following criteria, in conjunction with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Mission Capability-with sub areas; Scientific/Technical Merit, Operational Feasibility, Operational Readiness and Qualifications & Capabilities.  The Mission capability criteria and sub-areas will evaluate the offerors improved ability to satisfy specific mission area requirements, the ability to operationally field the technology, their knowledge, skills and technical expertise in the field of MASINT R&D, and the ability to rapidly respond to operational needs.  (2) Relevant Past & Present performance, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government/commercial contracts, and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Individual White Paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other White Papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White Papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a White Paper/proposal that shall be considered. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts. Options are discouraged and un-priced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in Oct 04. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging between $100,000 to $3 million per year. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this MASINT Transformational BAA, from Oct 04-Oct 08 is estimated over $100 million.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TOP-SECRET-SCI clearance or the means to support a special access security environment, facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to U.S. SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point for information if they contemplate responding.  Contact the Contracting Officer, Jody Tully, by e-mail at: jody.tully@patrick.af.mil. The e-mail must reference the title and MASINT Transformational BAA 05-01-JT2. Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer. 

The Program Office has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  Contractors from ZelTech, CTI, and EWA have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  They may be used to support comprehensive proposal understanding. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. This BAA is open and effective until Oct 08.
