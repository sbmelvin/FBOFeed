<CONTACT>THAYNE O'BRIEN CONTRACTING OFFICER 3077393447 thayne_o'brien@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service intends to award a sole source contract to McCullough Engineering & Contracting for the repair and reconstruction of the existing entrance to Hansen Cave at Timpanogos Cave NM.  This proposed action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competetive proposals, however, all expressions of interest received within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competetive procurement.  The work consists of furnishing equipment, materials and personnel to repair, reconstruct, and add onto the existing Ranger Room, and to construct a new shelter outside the entrance to Hansen Cave.  The Ranger Room is a cave (grotto) consisting of solid rock walls on three sides and the ceiling with one solid rock masonry wall.  Work on the Ranger Room includes sealing the fractured and leaking rock ceiling, installation of a sun tube through thick, solid rock masonry, and adding a second room inside the grotto including framing, rock masonry, windows and electrical wiring.  The cave entrance shelter is to be a new structure built of very heavy components designed to withstand severe weather and high impact from large falling rocks.  The entrance shelter will be a roofed structure with masonry columns of irregular height and anchored into a solid rock cliff face at multiple locations.  The location of both the Ranger Room and the entrance shelter construction site are at the entrance to Hansen Cave on a 15 foot wide, or less, rock ledge, accessed by a narrow and steep mile and one-half long foot trail that traverses steep canyon walls, scree and talus slopes, and passes through three tunnels as it climbs from the valley floor to the cave entrance, a nearly 1,200 feet elevation gain.  Sharp trail switchbacks prevent the use of standard wheeled vehicles, including all-terrain vehicles.  Contract evaluation factors being considered are: familiarity with the work site, technical capabilities and experience to work in high-risk steep mountain setting, specialized safety equipment necessary for the high-risk work site, demonstrated experience working in solid rock with heavy rock masonry in high-risk settings.  Strong emphasis on work safety at the site requires personnel to use specialized safety equipment and strict safe work practices.  All supplies and materials including rocks and cement for masonry work, and very large, heavy wood beams will be required to be airlifted from the canyon floor to the work site.  Work requires experience and familiarity with work in high risk areas and use of helicopters to lift and transport heavy construction materials to high-risk, mountain work sites.  Danger of falling rock can occur at any time throughout the work site.  Contractors must demonstrate completion of jobs of similar nature and show high quality of work consistent with historic character of setting, and good safety record.  Experience in dealing with work under similar highly hazardous work conditions is required.  References will be required.  The job site is located at Timpanogos Cave National Monument, Utah County, Utah.  Work is to be completed under NAISC Code 235410.  Estimated price range is between $125,000 and $175,000.

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS: DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of system and sub-system level technology for integration into the tactical environment that provide revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military, relative to current modes of operation. The goal of the program is the identification of areas for potential improved performance, and the design of systems and sub-systems to validate performance gains. The program focuses on the development of complete systems or subsystems rather than the enabling technologies. Proposed systems and sub-systems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, but may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems.  Proposed efforts should constitute at least two phases.  The first phase should seek to establish the technical feasibility of the concept.  Phases beyond the first should be proposed as options leading toward technology development.  AREAS OF INTEREST: DARPA-TTO has four primary focuses: aeronautic systems, space systems, land systems, and embedded processors and control systems. Its specific areas of interest include (but are not limited to) the following: improved deployability; reduced logistics burden; force projection and rapid ingress; logistic-support delivery systems; land vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft capable of new classes of missions; robotic vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft for surveillance, combat, and other missions; expanded flight regimes; advanced rotorcraft; biologically-inspired flight; subsonic through hypersonic flow control by plasmas or other means; unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) architectures and designs, including lethal naval missions; flight control, aerodynamics and propulsion concepts; rapid access, small cargo, affordable launch to orbit; short take-off and vertical landing manned, unmanned, and micro air vehicles; aircraft and missiles that are small-scale and carry effective mission packages; new spacecraft missions; on-orbit replenishment and component upgrade; modular spacecraft design and efficient utilization of space; autonomous spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control software; spacecraft sensors; exploitation of phenomenology observed from space platforms;  improved weapons and precision guided munitions; high-speed and long range weapons; high energy density propellants and explosives; passive and active protection systems; compact, high density pulse power supplies and pulse forming networks; high performance mobile power sources; high power lasers; innovative internal combustion engines; innovative turbine engines; innovative rocket engines; innovative spacecraft propulsion; network-centric distributed command and control and fire control systems; multiple redundancy communication systems; embedded processing and control; imaging through clouds and battlefield obscurants; sensor / data fusion; terrain intensification; multi-sensor data registration; real time adaptive sensor/platform control; automatic tactical sensor exploitation; technologies to deny situational awareness; modeling and simulation for evaluating new technologies at force level; collaborative behavior among several robotic (air, ground, or space) vehicles; innovative hybrid electric propulsion systems for flight vehicles; sensors for collision avoidance and Geo-location without global positioning system (GPS); self learning algorithms for robot navigation; airborne insertion methods for robots; integrated electro-optical millimeter wave sensor technology; and electronic maps.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Up to $2.0M may be available in FY 2002 for initial efforts. Multiple awards are anticipated during FY 2002. The amount of funds, if any, for efforts beyond FY 2002 has not been decided. Successful efforts during the initial funding period will increase the likelihood that TTO will make funds available after FY 2002. For Government programmatic flexibility, all offerors should segment their cost proposals as follows: an initial 12-month effort followed by one or more optional efforts. The total effort including options should not exceed four years.  OFFERORS: Teaming is encouraged. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in advanced tactical technology.  SCHEDULE: The purpose of the white paper is to solicit early feedback as to whether the research proposed will be of interest to TTO.  It is thus in the submitter's best interest to clearly articulate the innovative concept and technology development proposed.  The submission of the white paper is optional, but should be used by the offeror to avoid the expense of proposal generation for ideas that have little likelihood of selection within this BAA.  Submission of white papers before 12 July, 2002 is encouraged. TTO will endeavor to respond to each white paper within thirty (30) days after its receipt with a recommendation on the likelihood of selection. Regardless of the TTO recommendation based on its review of the white paper, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated.  This BAA will remain open through 13 Sept., 2002. Proposals received after the closing date of this BAA will not be reviewed or evaluated.  TTO will conduct an initial round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award. For the initial round of source selection, white papers should be submitted to TTO at the address identified below not later than 1600 local time, 26 Oct.,2001. In order to be considered for an award during this first round, proposals must be received by TTO at the address identified below on or before 1600 local time, 4 Jan., 2002.  Proposals received after that date will be reviewed and evaluated in a timely fashion.  As soon as the proposal evaluation is completed, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has been selected and the program will be funded, or 2) the proposal has been selected pending availability of funds, or 3) the proposal has not been selected. Proposals that are selected, pending the availability of funds, will be considered eligible for award within one (1) year after the closing of this BAA. Non-selected proposals will be destroyed; however, one copy of non-selected proposals may be retained for file purposes.  EVALUATION CRITERIA: Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a review using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1) Overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and experimental approach. 2) Potential contribution and relevance to TTO mission by meeting the goals of the BAA. 3) Offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort. 4) Project and technology transfer plans. The plans to carry out the work and the plans to accomplish technology transition to use by the military services. 5) Cost realism.

<DESC>The NASA's vision is To improve life here, To extend life to there, To find life beyond. The NASA mission is To understand and protect our home planet To explore the universe and search for life To inspire the next generation of explorers ....as only NASA can. NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) supports the Agency mission through scientific research that increases our understanding of and our capability to model and predict the Earth system, and through applications that expand and accelerate the realization of economic and societal benefits from Earth science, information, and technology.  The ESE also supports NASA's mission in "inspiring the next generation of explorers=85as only NASA can" by aligning with the Agency's priorities in education as follows: -        Motivate K-16+ students to pursue careers in science, mathematics and engineering;= =20 -   Provide educators with unique teaching tools and compelling teaching experiences;  -    Seek to ensure that we are investing the taxpayer's resources wisely; and, -    Engage minority and underrepresented students, educators, and researchers in NASA's education program. NASA intends to issue a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) to solicit proposals to assume responsibility in assisting NASA in the management of the GLOBE Program (www.globe.gov), which includes both worldwide implementation and coordination in the United States.  The purpose of the GLOBE Program is to improve student achievement in science and mathematics and enable student involvement in providing research-quality environmental observations that would otherwise be unavailable to the Earth science community.	GLOBE currently operates in the United States and 97 other countries and involves measurements in the study of the atmosphere, biosphere, and the water and energy cycle. Through this CAN, NASA seeks public-private partnership(s) that will continue, enhance, and expand the GLOBE contribution to NASA's objectives in K-12 mathematics and science education. This solicitation will be open to offerors from academic institutions, educational organizations, private not-for-profit, private for-profit, government organizations, or any consortium of these types of organizations. Offerors may propose to be the Worldwide Implementation Organization or the GLOBE US Country Coordinator, or both. Should any element of the US Government be selected under this notice, NASA would enter into an inter-agency or intra-agency agreement with that element rather than a cooperative agreement. Under the resulting agreement(s), NASA will provide funding for a transition period of approximately six (6) months and then provide combined funding of $5 million per year for five (5) years, pending availability of funds and satisfactory performance, that covers both worldwide implementation and US coordination. NASA may extend the agreement for up to five (5) additional years. Self-sufficiency for both areas of GLOBE activity after ten (10) years is desired. NASA intends to release the CAN in October 2002, with proposals due January 2003. NASA intends to announce the selection(s) in March 2003.  The ensuing transition from the current operation to the selected organization(s) is anticipated to be completed before December 2003. NASA intends to hold a pre-proposal conference in November 2002; the specific date and time will be posted at= =20=20 http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_y/code_y.cfm	and www.globe.gov.=20=20

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, in support of Fort Drum, intends to privatize its electric distribution, natural gas distribution, water treatment and distribution, and wastewater collection treatment and disposal systems. Fort Dr um is a U.S. Army installation located near the communities of Watertown and Carthage, New York. It is approximately 30 miles from Canada. The installation covers an area of 107,265 acres. Privatization is the conveyance ownership of a utility system, or p art of a utility distribution system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity and the simultaneous procurement of the utility distribution services from the new owner of the system. The acquisition of elec tricity, natural gas, and water as a commodity is not included in this contract. The Government will retain liability of any pre-existing environmental conditions. The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under 10 USC 2688. The conveyance will transfer all rights, title, and interest of the United States Government in and to the utility distribution system(s). The conveyance will not include any real property. The contract term for the utility distribution services may be up to 50 years. The Installation’s electrical distribution system is comprised of thirteen distribution feeders (three-phase 13.2 KV), which originated from two Government-owned 15 MVA, 115 kV – 13.2 kV substations. Niagara Mohawk Power Company provides  electricity to the substations at 115 kV. The distribution circuits contain approximately 101 miles of overhead electric primary and secondary line, and 69 miles of underground electric primary and secondary line. The majority of the electrical system on Fort Drum has been replaced, installed or upgraded in the last fifteen years. The electrical distribution system services approximately 2,500 family housing units and approximately 700 permanent and temporary facilities. The existing natural gas system ser ves approximately 2,227 family housing units and approximately 200 permanent and temporary facilities. Two service points are supplied with 15 psi. The main service provides natural gas into the installation’s dual 12” main lines. The second service point supplies gas into an 8” main. The system is interconnected between each delivery point. The system consists of medium and high-density polyethylene pipe and valves, contains over 70 miles of distribution mains and service laterals, and approximately 350 va lves, 35 of which are key valves.

While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received for this requirement.  Question 1:  The DHHS software system currently downloads to the carousel software system. The specification refers to carousel work station software as "Versatile Warehouse" or equal. Are we to assume that the present carousel workstation software. The source of the "Versatile Warehouse" software package would be helpful, and confirmation of whether it is a transaction processor (an existing DHHS host system downloads order information to the carousel software, while maintaining inventory quantity and locations on the host), or is the "Versatile Warehouse" software a stand-alone, inventory control system that handles all inventory functions (quantity on hand, primary and secondary locations, min/max levels, etc.)? I need to verify whether the basic inventory functions reside on the host side, or the carousel side. Answer to Question 1:  The software that operates the carousel receives downloaded order information from our host system.  The Versatile Warehouse application currently operates the existing equipment and maintains inventory quantities and locations on the carousel.  It does however, track min/max levels and locations on the carousel currently being used.  Versatile Warehouse software is a stand-alone system that receives data files from a web ordering system.  Question 2: Is the mezzanine free-standing or will be supported by the bottom carousels.  Answer to Question 2: The mezzanine must be free standing, IAW BOCA standards. (National Building Code)  The under structure of the mezzanine must not impede functionality of the existing hydraulic lift table, nor interfere with any current or future electrical equipment.  The specs call for the upper level of carousel to be supported by the existing carousels.  Additional weight from a metal mezzanine would not be acceptable.  The date and time for receipt of quotes for this solicitation has been extended to September 23, 2002 at 3:00 PM.

<DESC>THIS AMMENDMENT IS TO CORRECT THE CLOSING DATE UNDER THE DESCRPTION SECTION FROM SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 TO OCTOBER 7, 2002. 

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission invites industry review and comments on the draft statement of work to efficiently operate and maintain a computer-assisted system to receive, process, and disseminate all information relating to the Lost and Stolen Securities Program.

Purpose:  The purpose of this Request for Information is to:

1.Request ideas from industry on how to improve the operation and
efficiency of the existing system. 2. Request ideas on how to change/update the fee structure. 3. Obtain industry interest in the program. 4.	Gather information to assist the SEC in updating system specifications.  The government is open to alternative concepts.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives that can be demonstrated to provide improvements/enhancements to the Lost and Stolen Securities Program, including its database, reports, inquiries and fee structure. 1.0	Background: On August 5, 1977, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") announced the implementation of the Lost and Stolen Securities Program (the "Program") under Section 17(f)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934   and Rule l7f-1 (17 CFR 240.17f-1) there under.  The purpose of the Program is to reduce the trafficking in illicit securities by making available to brokers, dealers, and federally-insured banks, among others, information that identifies missing, lost, stolen, and counterfeit securities.  To implement Rule 17f-1, the Commission determined that a computer-assisted system should 
be used and that a non-Government entity should receive, process, and disseminate all information relating to the Program.  As of December 31, 2001, the Program's database contained data on approximately 26 million certificates reported as lost, stolen, 
missing, or counterfeit, and 25,296 reporting institutions were 
registered in the Program.  During 2001, reporting institutions 
reported as lost, stolen, missing, or counterfeit 2,954,692 
certificates.  Those reporting institutions also reported the recovery of 218,744 certificates previously reported during 2001 as lost, stolen, missing or counterfeit. 2.0 Draft Statement of Work - The Contractor shall (1) design, develop, test, implement, operate, and maintain the software for a computerized database of the missing, lost, stolen, and counterfeit securities; (2)  process missing, lost, stolen, recovery, and counterfeit reports from reporting institutions and add the information contained on the missing, lost, stolen, and counterfeit reports (e.g., the reporting institution's Financial Industry Number Standard ("FINS number"), the certificate's CUSIP number, certificate number, etc.) to the database or match up each recovery report with the 
appropriate lost, stolen or counterfeit report in the database filed by the same reporting institution that filed the recovery report and delete the reported information from the database  ; and (3)  process inquiries from reporting institutions concerning the data captured and stored in the database. The operational process involves two basic functions: reporting and inquiring.  First, under the Program all reporting institutions (brokers, dealers, federally insured banks, and registered transfer agents, among others) must report missing, lost, stolen, counterfeit, 
and recovered securities to the contractor in a standardized format using Form X-17F-1A.   Pertinent information contained in each report is entered by the Contractor into a computerized, cumulative database.  Second, reporting institutions must inquire of the Contractor to determine if certain securities certificates being presented to them have been reported as missing, lost, stolen or counterfeited.  The Contractor operates and maintains the database, processes reports, and responds to inquiries.  
3.0	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS - Although the Contractor may choose its own particular mix of manual and computerized functions, the electronic database must accommodate certain minimum information identified on Form X-17F-1A (e. g., the 
Financial Industry Number Standard ("FINS number") of the reporting institution, the certificate?s CUSIP number,  its certificate number, and the number of shares of an equity security or the face value of a debt security) on all certificates reported as lost, stolen, missing, or counterfeit.   The Contractor shall have the capability to "flag" a particular CUSIP number or a subset of a particular CUSIP number (e.g., by issuance date(s) or within a range of certificate numbers). A flag only indicates a potential match but it may become an actual match if, for example, the securities certificate being inquired about has been cancelled on the books of the issuer (meaning that the lost, missing, or stolen certificate is worthless).  The system must accommodate all reporting institutions, which are 
required to register as either direct or indirect inquirers under Rule 17f-1.  A direct inquirer is a reporting institution that inquirers of the contractor directly, i.e., by computer terminal, telephone or by other means (as distinct from indirect inquirers who inquire only through direct inquirers). As of December 31, 2001, there were 25,926 reporting institutions registered in the  Program [consisting of 1,693 direct inquirers and 24,233 indirect inquirers].  The Contractor shall have the facilities and capacity to process inquiries and reports from several different types of communications: 1. Host-to-host communication, 2. PC dial-up communication, 3. Interactive telephonic communication, 
4. Facsimile machine communication, 5. Mail communication, 6. Other. The Contractor shall furnish adequate telephone  coverage to provide electronic hook-up for host-to-host communications and PC dial-up communications within a maximum of thirty (30) seconds after the call is placed. The Contractor must provide direct inquirers access to PC dial-up communications during regular business hours. The Contractor shall provide adequate telephone coverage to respond to an interactive telephonic communication with an electronic response indicating that the caller has reached the system, within a maximum of thirty (30) seconds after the caller places the call and to provide the caller with a live operator to respond to the caller's inquiry within a maximum of two (2) minutes. The Contractor shall be open for operation from at least 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time on any day a registered national securities exchange is open for business.
The Contractor shall provide a system to accommodate the existing
database and allow for additional storage space to accommodate all additional data gathered over the life of the contract. The Program's database and all forms, files, and other information associated with the Program are the property of the Commission.  Thus the Contractor is prohibited from using such information in any manner other then to operate this Program.  Based on current operations, the system to be offered must accommodate at least thirty-four (34) gigabytes of on-line disk storage and allow 
for an approximate growth rate of thirty percent (30%) annually.
Additionally, the system must provide for off-line data storage for archived materials (e.g., reports and confirmations) of the database and must maintain adequate storage space to accommodate additional off-line and on-line data, forms, files, and other information associated with the Program gathered over the  term of the anticipated contract (base year plus four one year options). 4.0 TECHNICAL - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE - The computer language currently being used by the current contractor is 
C.  The successor Contractor, however, is not required to use the 
computer language of the current Contractor as long as the existing database can be transferred into the new computer system.
5.0 FEES - The Contractor shall perform all tasks associated with this contract at no cost to the Commission or the U.S. Government.  In order to maintain a no cost environment, the Contractor will be compensated for its service by directly  charging direct inquirers.  These fees received by the Contractor shall cover the entire cost of operating and maintaining the system.  This solicitation does not include any Government 
furnished equipment, installation or training.  The Contractor must set a fee for each service that it will provide.  In setting the fees, the Contractor shall develop its fee structure 
giving consideration to the size and classification of the various inquirers and ensuring that the fees do not discourage the use of the program.  Currently, inquirers are divided into three (3) classifications: banks, securities organizations, and non-bank transfer agents. Further, within each classification these organizations are divided into sub-classes according to their size.  Fees are to be fair and reasonable, and the fees shall be part of the contract.  The fee schedule shall cover all Contractor costs; i.e., facilities, equipment, equipment maintenance, installation, training, labor, labor overhead, 
G&A, profit.  The current fee structure generates income from six categories: registration fees, volume fees, indirect inquirer file maintenance fees, prompt written confirmation service fees, direct port access fees, and computer to computer (host-to-host communications) inquiry fees.  All fees are currently charged to direct inquirers on a semi annual basis.  6.0	FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS - The Contractor shall have the financial resources to meet the contract's start up costs and the ongoing costs and the other contingent costs and operating losses that may arise due to fluctuations in usage, inability to collect fees, inadequacies in its fee structure, or losses due to other causes (e.g., obligations relating to the Contractor?s own contractual liabilities or lawsuits involving negligence or other misconduct on the part of the Contractor).  The importance of this contract to the public interest requires such precautions.  7.0	PHYSICAL SECURITY - The Contractor shall be responsible for restricting access to operational areas (e.g., through use of alarm systems, access controls, etc.) and for providing environmental safeguards to protect operations from manmade or natural catastrophes (e.g., fire, flood, etc.).  The Contractor shall store at least one copy of all reports and inquiries (whether maintained on premises or preferably at off-site storage) in locked, fireproof cabinets located in a restricted access area for the life of the contract and shall turn over such records to the successor contractor.  The Contractor shall state specifically the medium on which it will keep the copies of all reports and inquiries.

<SOLNBR>DTRA01-BAA-SS01
<RESPDATE>072302
<CONTACT>Cynthia Sanders, 703-325-9210
<DESC>NA The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to establish long-term strategic partnerships with several colleges and universities.  The purpose of these partnerships will be to provide DTRA additional research and development capabilities, and to mai ntain critical skills needed by the Department of Defense in the science and engineering communities.  DTRA intends to award multiple year contracts to selected colleges and universities based on responses to a forthcoming Broad Area Announcement (BAA).   DTRA’s strategic partnership objectives are to obtain new ideas, perspectives, and independent views related to the DTRA mission essential functions that are unencumbered by how we have done things in the past.  Such independent and new perspectives could address technology, policy, strategy, or related infrastructure considerations.  In addition, we recognize that independent organizations may well already possess unique facilities/capabilities that could be effectively put to use on issues of concern for DTRA.   DTRA intends to solicit university assistance in any or all of its four mission essential function areas; Combat Support, Technology Development, Threat Control, and Threat Reduction.  Selected colleges and universities may be awarded contracts to:    Assist the Agency in its Combat Support role to the Department of Defense to deter, engage and assess the WMD threat and challenges posed to the US and its allies.  Specifically, provide the intellectual framework to develop - Improved WMD response capabilities - Enhanced capabilities for forces operating in WMD environments - Assessments regarding the threat from improvised nuclear devices and radiation dispersal devices, and the potential to deter such threats - Assessments of the political ramifications of nuclear release in an allied or friendly country - Understanding of the future value of deterrence and its characteristics - WMD forensics capabilities   Conduct Technology Development research and development activities in coordination with the Agency.  Specifically, - Assess the relative weight to be placed on simulations versus simulators.  What are the practical and theoretical limits of each? - Understand the theoretical limits to conventional attack of deep and buried targets.   - Develop microscale weather modeling for use in collateral effects calculations and consequence management - Propose innovative energy production, distribution and storage mechanisms for various applications  - Develop electromagnetic threat protection and applications - Improve detection and characterization of biological and chemical threats - Develop innovative means to defeat/neutralize WMD agents - Analyze weapon system performance - Develop unconventional and conventional means to functionally defeat WMD facilities and delivery systems   Support Agency Threat Control efforts to shape and manage technology security by, - Developing non-intrusive detection mechanisms for WMD - Integrating surveillance, detection, and characterization of threats linked to pretested menus of responses - Developing super networks which can interconnect multiple databases and perform detailed analysis of large masses of data-including artificial intelligence - Assessing the impact of future arms control treaty policy and implementation  - Innovating advanced technologies for verification and compliance monitoring   Support Agency Threat Reduction efforts to assist eligible states of the former Soviet Union to reduce the threat of WMD devices and proliferation. Specifically, - Improve management systems for enhanced monitoring and accountability of high value items - Develop enhanced security systems for positive control of weapons and weapons by-products - Assess policies and strategies for expanding current agreements to include the full range of WMD - Develop structural protection, response, and repair tools The purpose of this synopsis is to solicit feedback, to be used by DTRA to properly scope the BAA, from potentially interested colleges and universities.  Specifically, DTRA requests potentially interested academic institutions to respond to any or all of the following questions: 1)  What part(s) of the above DTRA mission essential functions would your institution be interested in responding to? 2)  What duration contract and dollar value would be enough to provide a viable contract for a long-term partnership? 3)  How should we optimally structure the resulting contract to get the best results and give you the optimum flexibility?  Are there ways, other than a Broad Area Announcement, to establish a Strategic Partnership, which would lead to a contract that you suggest we consider? 4)  Does your university fall within the category of 'Historically Black College or University'? 5)  Does your university have partnerships with any other government organizations, such as the Department of Energy or other parts of the Department of Defense?  Do these partnerships utilize similar kinds of skills? 6)  What selection criteria would you suggest be used to select a small set of academic institutions for long-term partnerships? Please send responses to any or all of these questions, and any other feedback, to Cynthia Sanders, Contract Specialist, via facsimile at (703) 325-9294 or e-mail (cynthia.sanders@dtra.mil) or mail to (DTRA/ALT, 6801 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-33 98) by close of business on 23 July.

<DESC>The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is seeking sources for an Optical Comb Generator (OCG) for the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Project.  The NIF Project is funded by the Department of Energy (DoE) and is being constructed at LLNL.  The NIF is an inertial confinement fusion research facility that will contain 192 independent laser beams converging in a fusion-target chamber. The OCG will be utilized as part of the NIF diagnostic equipment and will operate at a fixed wavelength between 500 and 700 nanometers with shorter wavelength being preferable. The OCG will provide a time reference signal on high-speed streak cameras operating from 2.5 to 1000 nanoseconds full-scale sweep. Previous OCGs have employed directly modulated laser diodes operating at 820 nanometers. These OCGs work well for streak cameras having an "S1" photocathode response but are too long a wavelength for cameras with an "S20" photocathode response. The OCG will produce an optical pulse train with the following fixed frequencies: 10 MHz, 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 100 MHz, 200 MHz, 400 MHz, 1 GHz, 2 GHz, and 4 GHz. The frequency will be selected by a digital interface and a local select control. Well-defined pulses with a pulse width less than 25% of the period for each frequency are preferable to purely sinusoidal pulses. Mach-Zender type modulators provide a suitable pulse shape. The pulse train will be gated by an externally triggered macro-pulse adjustable from 1 to 10 microseconds. The pulse rate of this macro-pulse will be 10 Hz or less. The average optical power will therefore be very low but peak power from 2 to 5 microwatt in each pulse is required. The OCG design should be compact (12 inches x 4 inches x 4 inches or smaller) and robust so that alignment or adjustment are rarely needed. Technical questions may be addressed to Mark Rhodes via e-mail at plasma99@llnl.gov.
