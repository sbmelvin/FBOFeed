<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NNA05AC42C with Integrated Science Solutions,Inc. on a sole source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One ResponsibleSource.  The performance period will be extended for a potential six month period,consisting of a three month base period, and three one-month options.  The principlepurpose of this contract is to provide environmental support to NASA Ames ReserachCenter.  The current contractor provides the following mission critical support servicesunder the environment contract:  Environmental Compliance, Pollution Prevention andSustainability, Wildlife and Habitat Conservation and NEPA Compliance, Site Investigationand Restoration, and Environmental Management Systems.	The purpose of this contractextension is to assure continuing compliance with numerous Federal, State and Localenvironmental laws, regulations, and policies in carrying out NASA/ARC's mission criticalprograms, projects, and activities.This extension will begin February 4, 2011 and end on May 3, 2011 for the base period;and end on August 3, 2011 if all three one-month options are exercised.  The extension isin the Government's best interest to provide ongoing environmental services until a newcontract is awarded.  The current contractor, Integrated Science Solutions, Inc. isconsidered the only contractor that can meet ARC's needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension.	Additionally, competing the requirement for a period ofup to a six month term would not be possible given the end date of the current contractand the requirement for uninterrupted service.	Awarding the potential six month contractto another contractor at the same time the recompete is in process would result insubstantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recoveredthrough competition of the extension as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARC'scritical requirements.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30 p.m. local timeon January 14, 2011.

<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years.

Further, the Contractor will not only coordinate its activities with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and any other stakeholder in the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing on these claims to determine whether they are complete and ready for payment. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor will calculate Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) that educates providers about the Medicare program and responds to provider telephone and written inquiries; respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction H (comprised of the states of Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico) on or about January 27, 2011. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is March 17, 2011 with an anticipated award date of July 15, 2011.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) which will solicit proposals to provide Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency of HRSA-Supported Programs, Program Components and Initiatives; Assessment of Environmental/Policy Issues which may Impact HRSA-supported Activities; and Strengthening Evaluation Capability. <br />
<p><br />The overall purpose of the Evaluation IDIQ is to assist with assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of HRSA-supported programs, program components or initiatives activities; assessment of environmental/policy issues which may impact the effectiveness of HRSA-supported activities; and strengthening evaluation capability. Potential studies may focus on facilitating high-priority evaluation studies, evaluation and information syntheses, policy and environmental assessments, performance measurement tools and systems and strengthening evaluation capability.</p>
<p>Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency of HRSA-Supported Programs, Program Components and Initiatives may include studies that focus on the effectiveness and efficiency of HRSA-supported programs - for example, operations (i.e., the best way to accomplish program goals); achievement of specified objectives and goals; and potential development of performance measures in light of the Agency's GPRA and PART requirements.</p>
<p>Additional examples of potential studies include addressing such topics as: implementation of planned program models or designs; program functioning, including assessment of the efficiency of program management; quality improvement approaches and results; client perception of program availability and accessibility; accomplishment of operational targets, meeting standards, and following national guidelines; and identification of "best practices" among a number of similar program sites</p>
<p>Assessment of Environmental/Policy Issues which may impact HRSA-supported Activities includes those studies that will primarily focus on either 1) the external context of programs and how forces in the larger society affect HRSA programs and their progress toward achieving goals and objectives (e.g., health and human service system changes, such as the increase in managed care or the changes in the welfare system; social, economic and political changes, such as the increase in population without health insurance, etc.) or 2) the development and assessment of various policy alternatives related to HRSA programs or interests (i.e., how actual, planned, or potential changes in current public and private policies and implementation strategies would affect attainment of program goals and objectives. Examples of studies may include 1) interaction of local, state, and Federal policies with HRSA-supported activities; 2) impact of changes in financial policy by Federal payers on the recipients of HRSA funds and their clients or patients.<br />Strengthening Evaluation Capability includes those studies that will focus primarily on either 1) determination and strengthening of the capacity for health-related evaluation both within HRSA and among its grantees; or 2) design, development, and assessment of health-related evaluation data systems.</p>
<p>Studies related to the determination and strengthening of capacity for health-related evaluation could focus on the following types of activities: identifying current needs and recommendations for programs both within HRSA and among its grantees to conduct effective evaluation; providing technical assistance and training to help build evaluation capacity among HRSA grantees; support of activities that strengthen local health-related evaluation efforts.<br />Studies related to the design, development, and assessment of health-related evaluation data systems will focus on health-related evaluation data and data systems issues including such studies as: the design of data systems that could be used for program monitoring and to measure the performance and impact of HRSA-supported activities; the development and testing of these data systems; the evaluation, modification, or refinement of existing HRSA data systems to make them more useful for monitoring and evaluation purposes; exploration, development and implementation of methodologies for linking national data sets; linking national data sets with State data; and linking data across states.<br />Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. Contractors are encouraged to sign-up, on the fedbizopps.gov website, for email notification of all actions relevant to this solicitation, and on the interested vendors list, also listed at the bottom of this announcement.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, with DIGILAB, INC., 84 October Hill Road, Holliston, MA 01746, for a replacement of an existing Proprep in-gel digestion robot. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>A major part of the mission of the Protein Facility at NINDS is the performance in-gel digestion of proteins for Protein ID. The huge volume of samples submitted by the NINDS and other NIH Investigators require the use of Laboratory Robot to perform the tedious steps in this process.</p>
<p>- The Investigator ProPrep is a fully integrated system for automated in-gel digestion and spotting of proteins separated by electrophoresis. ProPrep combines the functions of the existing Investigator digestion (ProGest) and spotting (ProMS) stations; into a single, integrated platform thereby offering increased throughput, flexibility and capability. In addition, to spotting peptide fragments, the user can also re-plate peptide pools into 96 or 384 well plates for additional analysis by other methods such as LC/MS/MS.</p>
<p>- The ProPrep includes proven protocols covering all of the steps of in-gel digestion: washing, reduction, alkylation and proteolytic digestion. The instrument also automates sample cleanup procedures, addition of matrix, and spotting onto MDLDT targets.</p>
<p>- The built-in Window 2000 workstation, SQL Server 2000 database and LCD monitor enable the user to easily store protocols, bed layouts &amp; create customized protocols using the included Method Editor software.</p>
<p>- One (1) year warranty and replacement parts, technical support included.</p>
<p>- One (1) preventive maintenance inspection, free software upgrades, and emergency service visits included.</p>
<p>- Dimensions: 110cm (w) x 80 cm (d) x 97 cm (Lid Closed) 180 cm (Incl. Cart) + 58 cm w/ door open (h)</p>
<p>Many in-gel digestion protocols have been developed over the years specifically using this instrument. It is important to replace the instrument with the exact same model and make to continue the studies at the NINDS Lab.</p>
<p>DigiLab Inc. is the only known company who manufacture the In-gel digestion Laboratory Robots. It is therefore determined that Digilab is the only source qualified to provide the required item. No other sources will satisfy the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses submitted to ln18x@nih.gov on or before 5:00 PM ET January 15, 2011. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Noetic was competitively awarded the initial CH-46E CDNU software design and development contract in 2003. As a result, Noetic has gained the specific, in-depth knowledge of the CH-46E CDNU software code which is needed to perform the proposed effort within the timeframe necessary to meet current Fleet needs within budgetary constraints imposed upon PMA-226. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of Title 10, U.S.C. Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." A determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government. Subcontracting opportunities may be available and should be sought with Noetic Software Inc, 2300 Computer Ave, Suite A6, Willow Grove, PA 19090. The period of performance of the proposed effort is estimated to be 12 months. This synopsis is for informational purposes only. Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to procure the manufacture and assembly of the rotor for three of the VIRGINIA Class submarine propulsor systems required to support the Block III (FY11-FY13) and Block IV (FY14 and FY15) ship construction program.  The solicitation will be for four years comprised of one base and three option periods.  The base year provides for one rough machined rotor casting and associated non-recurring engineering and manufacturing efforts to reflect lessons learned and design changes from prior units.  These deliverables will be incorporated into the first option period resulting in the first manufactured and assembled rotor.   Each of the two additional option periods will provide one complete rotor.
  The solicitation will be issued to Rolls-Royce Naval Marine, Incorporated (RRNMI), 3719 Industrial Road, Pascagoula, MS  39581-5232 since it has prior success in the manufacture of a VIRGINIA Class rotor and is the only company that possesses the design, data and expertise necessary to provide the supplies within the time required to meet the Navyâ€™s requirements. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact RRNMI directly.  Questions regarding the synopsis should be directed to Fred M. Pohlmann at fred.pohlmann@navy.mil.  

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.
  While it is understood that FBO is the single entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)&nbsp;intends to procure the services of LexisNexis, on a sole source basis,&nbsp;for maintenance of the CFTC's Legislative History Database.&nbsp; The database, which was developed by LexisNexis and is currently being hosted by LexisNexis, contains the statutory history of the agency.&nbsp; One of the primary uses of the database is by the agency lawyers who utilize the&nbsp;database to determine the legislative intent of wording in the statutes.&nbsp; A significant and vital feature of the database is that the documents in the agency history include links to cited information that is contained in LexisNexis's proprietary database, and the agency is able to access those documents via the provided links.&nbsp;&nbsp;The maintenance services will include hosting the database, incorporating new legislative documents into&nbsp;the database, maintaining and updating cited links and correcting any errors that are identified in the database.&nbsp; The anticipated contract will have a base period of performance of one (1) year, and four (4) option years.&nbsp; Based on the procurement history of this requirement, CFTC believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government for development of the database by a new contractor.&nbsp; This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers and, as such, no solicitation is available.&nbsp; However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the date and time identified above.&nbsp; Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement.&nbsp; Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of the CFTC.&nbsp;

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>
VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services ((preliminary concepts and layouts, program development, investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services)) for Renovate 7W for Patient Ward, Project#  528A7-11-701.  
This project proposes to redesign and renovate the existing the seventh floor west ward which is currently used mostly for office space into a general medical/general surgical in-patient care ward.  This ward will function first as swing space as other wards are redesigned and must be functional for a wide range of medical needs.  The project will be designed utilizing the space criteria set forth in the VA PG 18-9, Chapter 100, Medical Surgical Patient Care Units.   

This project will demolish the necessary existing walls, electric, lighting, ceiling, floor tile, asbestos mastic abatement, mechanical equipment, ductwork, and plumbing for approximately 7600 gsf of existing office space and will redesign a new state of the art ward which will produce a 16-32 bed unit (depending on space guidelines) with private patient rooms and private baths.  New ward will contain all required medical gas, nurse call, and necessary appurtenances for an inpatient care area.

The intent is for the design to occur during FY2011 with construction in FY2012.

Short-List Criteria to select the firms for interview will be based on H09 Hospital and Medical Facilities, especially design and construction expertise within existing facilities, technical competence, specific experience and qualifications of proposed personnel and consultants along with record of working together as a team, past performance for VA work, geographic location of the firm, success in prescribing the use of recovered materials, waste reduction and energy efficiency, and the inclusion of small business consultants.  Special consideration in the evaluation and selection process will be given to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  Final ranking of interviewed firms will be based on the team proposed for this project, previous VA experience of the team, and specific hospital ward renovation design experience in existing facilities.

The area of consideration is restricted to firms with offices and key personnel to be assigned to the designs located within a 275 mile radius of the Syracuse VA Medical Center as indicated by a mapquest.com driving directions search from prime designer to 800 Irving Ave, Syracuse NY 13210. 

 Appropriate data for this project must be submitted to the Contracting Officer on 
Standard Form 330 no later than January 28, 2010 by 2:00PM.  THREE COPIES OF EACH (along with any supplemental information) ARE REQUIRED.  Submissions should emphasize experience on similar projects, the key personnel to be assigned to this project, and specific VA experience. It is anticipated interviews for selection will be conducted the first two weeks of February 2011 and that a cost proposal from the A/E firm ranked as the most highly qualified will be required to be submitted no later than March 7, 2011.

This is not a request for proposals.  NAICS 541310 applies. Construction cost estimate is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Apache Attack Helicopter Project Office is seeking sources with innovative approaches, designs, or products for a new replacement radar on the AH-64D Apache helicopter.  The AH-64 is the U.S. Army's primary attack helicopter and is designed to fight during the day, night, and in adverse weather.  The AH-64 can be armed with 16 HELLFIRE missiles, a 30mm M230 chain gun, and/or 76 2.75 inch folding fin rockets.  The U.S. Army is close to completing development of new hardware for the current Fire Control Radar (FCR) that is mounted on the main rotor mast above the rotors.  This new FCR hardware will enhance the detection capabilities of the AH-64 as well as reduce the logistical burden, operations and sustainment costs, eliminate obsolescence issues, and improve reliability over the current FCR.  Even with these new updates, a new radar is envisioned with additional design updates and capabilities to assist the AH-64 in effectively operating in previous, current, and emerging theaters of operation.<BR><BR>REQUIREMENTS:  The new radar concept must have an open-systems architecture and be compatible with AH-64D Block I, II, and III aircraft.   Capabilities desired include all weather operation for detection, targeting, tracking, and situational awareness in air, land, and sea environments.   The radar must effectively operate in a high clutter environment simultaneously tracking multiple targets both moving and stationary at varying ranges and Radar Cross Section (RCS) size.  The envisioned target set for this radar will include armored tracked/wheeled vehicles, air defense systems, commercially acquired light trucks/cars, air targets including Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), dismounted personnel, and maritime targets.  Technology and/or systems that provide 360 degree situational awareness and targeting capability, intuitive and/or easy to use displays, no moving parts, light weight, low Radar Cross Section, and aerodynamic improvements over the current FCR are highly desired.  Additionally, it's desired that the radar be capable of supporting radar imagery and target data integration with off platform sensor (UAS), and onboard electro optical sensor imagery to rapidly achieve a fully integrated targeting and situational awareness display to the pilot.  Already proven packages are preferred that will support a two level maintenance concept.  The design/concept must be able to endure in a high vibration environment, meet Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) including Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) requirements and not interfere with the aircraft safety, adversely affect aircraft weight and balance limitations nor interfere with existing systems.  <BR><BR>The U.S. Army seeks qualified vendors to provide conceptual papers, design information, technology availability, maturity, identification of risks, product descriptions, support requirements, reliability data including Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) data addressing all or any part of the requirements or discussion points detailed above.  Additionally, the U.S. Army is seeking sources with a strong background, history, and/or past performance in streamlining and facilitating rapid acquisition, addressing obsolescence, enhancing USG-contractor interactions, and containing costs with comprehensive cost controls.  Innovative ideas and solutions are strongly encouraged especially regarding testing and use of modeling and simulation during system development.  Interested vendors are encouraged to provide substantiated evidence of their capabilities and successes in the areas cited above.  <BR><BR>All interested qualified sources are encouraged to submit written notification of their interest, qualifications, and technical concepts to the Contracting Officer, Cheryl Moore-Davis, (256) 313-4133, e-mail address is cmoore.davis@us.army.mil.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Suspense is 90 days after synopsis.

<p>1.2 Background</p>
<p>1.2.1 Site History</p>
<p>The Pantex Plant is a U.S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (USDOE/NNSA) owned, contractor-operated facility, managed by B&amp;W Pantex, LLC. Pantex was originally constructed by the U.S. Army for production of conventional ordnance during World War II. Pantex was deactivated after the war and the property reverted to the War Assets Administration. Texas Technological College purchased the installation in 1949. The Army Ordnance Corps reclaimed the site in 1951 for use by the Atomic Energy Commission as a nuclear weapons facility. Today the Plant's mission is to assemble nuclear weapons for the nation's stockpile; disassemble nuclear weapons being retired from the stockpile; evaluate repair and retrofit nuclear weapons in the stockpile; demilitarize and sanitize components from dismantled nuclear weapons; provide interim storage for plutonium pits from dismantled nuclear weapons; and develop, fabricate, and test chemical explosives and explosive components for nuclear weapons to support DOE initiatives. The Pantex Plant is located in Carson County, approximately 17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas. The plant site is bound on the north by Texas Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 293, on the east by FM 2373, and on the west by FM 683. DOE has 1,526 acres east of FM 2373. To the south, DOE-owned property on the site extends to within 1.6 km (1 mile) of U.S. Highway 60. DOE owns approximately 11,703 acres at Pantex Plant.</p>

These tasksare performed in an environment, which at times, is very dynamic and has very highprocessing demands.  In addition, the actions taken by the user, or those they supplywith information, have safety critical implications.  The individuals using thetrajectory software will in some cases work in an isolated environment and in other caseswill work in a distributed multi-user environment.  In order to understand how wellsuited the candidate software is for use in this context, we need to understand thedesign approaches employed by the software.  NASA's desire is to get short responses thatinclude what features the software has that address these concerns, or a short suggestionon how the software may be complemented to address these concerns.The approach employed in this evaluation is based on concepts from the SoftwareEngineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon, which developed approaches for evaluating howwell suited a software system is for an environment based on several key qualityattributes.  The quality attributes to be addressed are the Availability/Reliability,Ability to Modify, Performance/Scalability, Security, Testability, and Usability of thecandidate software when placed in our environment.  This RFI is concerned about thearchitecture of the software suite and the elements of that architecture that addressthese concerns.Some of the capabilities required to address the quality concerns expressed in thefollowing list will not be provided directly by the trajectory software.  In the caseswhere there is no direct support, the analysis should turn to how the software has beenintegrated with other components that do provide the required capabilities.  Forinstance, the trajectory software may not provide a transactional database, but maysupport a database interface. Another example may be that the trajectory software may notdirectly support any messaging protocols, but provides an adaptor mechanism for accessingapplication data so it could be distributed through a messaging bus.  So the intent ofthis analysis is to determine what elements of the trajectory softwares design directlyor indirectly enable us to address these quality concerns.NASA is requesting information about the design approaches and technologies employed bythe software as they relate to the following quality concerns:Quality ConcernsAvailability/ReliabilityAbility to ModifyPerformance/ScalabilitySecurityTestabilityUsability No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.Response Submission Deadline:Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than 11:59 PM Eastern Standard Time, onMay 28, 2010.  RFI submissions will be accepted as e-mail attachments only.  Allresponses must be sent to john.r.carpentier@nasa.gov, with Traj RFI Response andNNJ10ZHD001L in the subject line.  An e-mail confirmation of receipt from NASA will besent within a one-week period to the designated point of contact.Point of Contact for Inquiries and Submissions:Inquiries/questions regarding this proposal may be directed to NASA Johnson Space Center,Attn: J.R.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND.<br />The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to continue supporting the NIDDK Genetics Repository. The repository will allow the continued storage, maintenance, and quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to the study of diseases under the mandate of the NIDDK. It facilitates sharing of resources, thus encouraging work by a broad group of investigators and perhaps, increasing the sample size and the resulting power of a study to identify the genetic determinants of a disease. It helps to ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts. The current contractor is the Rutgers State University.</p>
<p>The cell immortalization and other tasks are highly technical, and require extensive experience and expertise. The success rate for cell immortalization is extremely variable depending on how well the established methods are implemented as well as on the quality and volume of the initial blood sample. As the value of many genetics studies rests on the ability to analyze the DNA of relatives, inability to recover DNA from any particular sample may negate the value of multiple samples. In addition, samples collected from pediatric patients may be very small, but valuable and irreplaceable. Therefore, it is essential that the success rate for establishing cell lines be as close to 100% as possible. Furthermore, the ability to track thousands of genetic samples, preventing sample mix-ups and cross-contamination while maintaining a high-throughput processing system, is crucial to the integrity of the studies being supported. The Contractor's project director must have extensive experience in successfully providing these genetics and sample processing services, including blood cell immortalization and DNA extraction and distribution, to a large group of investigators. The Contractor's staff must be highly trained to carry out exacting technical tasks accurately and reproducibly. As all the work is with samples is from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples. Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.<br />The objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Genetics Repository to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:</p>
<p>&bull; Receive blood samples from NIDDK funded grants;<br />&bull; Process these data and materials to create cell lines, cryopreserved lymphocytes, and/or DNA or RNA samples;<br />&bull; Receive externally produced immortalized lymphocyte cell lines; and <br />&bull; Widely distribute all materials to qualified investigators in the scientific community in a variety of customized formats.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.<br />All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement must demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull; Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;</p>
<p>&bull; Establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository;</p>
<p>&bull; Create and store viable cell lines via Epstein-Barr virus transformation of lymphocytes from blood samples, with a success rate of 98% or greater and expanding the lymphoblastoid cell lines;</p>
<p>&bull; Receive and store lymphoblastoid cell lines prepared at other facilities and carry out quality control assessments;</p>
<p>&bull; Cryopreserve blood cells for eventual transformation and/or DNA extraction;</p>
<p>&bull; Extract and store DNA from cell lines or from isolated blood cells and, with designated samples, separating the white blood cells (buffy coat) from the plasma;</p>
<p>&bull; Carry out limited genotyping for verifying sample identity and quality;</p>
<p>&bull; Distribute cell lines and biosamples to investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including arraying in a variety of formats, packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;</p>
<p>&bull; Withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer;</p>
<p>&bull; Establish and maintain Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery;</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking and reporting of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, seamless interaction with the Database Repository, and listing of investigators using the repository;</p>
<p>&bull; Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee, and the Steering Committee.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.<br />A base year plus four one year option periods is anticipated.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognize that it is critical to establish relationships with organizations that encourage and foster communication and information access. A major effort to enhance understanding of information needs, resources, and services began in June 1993 when NLM and the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) cosponsored a conference that brought together users of NIH information resources including health care providers, scientists, information specialists, journalists, and members of the community affected by HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the conference was to review the various HIV/AIDS information services, assess current efforts with respect to needs, and identify additional needs. The resultant recommendations were widely circulated and continue to be utilized for planning and informational purposes. The conference report is available on the NLM AIDS Web Site http://www.sis.nlm.nih.gov/hiv/nihrpt.pdf.<br /><br />Patients and the affected community want access to the most up-to-date and accurate health information to manage their care and make informed decisions about their health. Health care providers and health educators also need access to the most current information to provide the highest quality of care. Information access disparities exist in many communities that are affected by the digital divide. NLM is committed to assisting community-based organizations in accessing the spectrum of information resources and services that are currently available. <br /><br />As a result of the recommendations made during the conference, the National Library of Medicine issued a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for AIDS Community Information Outreach projects in May of 1994. Between 1995 and 2010, similar solicitations were issued (see http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/outreach/aids_cio_projects.html for a list of past award recipients). The goal of the AIDS Community Information Outreach funding is to improve access to HIV/AIDS related health information by patients, the affected community, and their caregivers. NLM has continued to issue this solicitation into the year 2010 and has awarded over 270 organizations with funding in an effort to eliminate disparity of information access in the HIV/AIDS Community. <br /><br /><strong>Objectives<br /></strong><br />The purpose of the AIDS Community Information Outreach Project is to design local programs for improving HIV/AIDS health information access for patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers and the general public. Emphasis is on providing information or access to health and medical information in a way meaningful to the target community, and increasing the awareness and utilization of NLM online health and medical resources in the HIV/AIDS Community. <br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements <br /></strong><br />Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories:<br /><br />1. Information Retrieval: To provide or improve access to electronic AIDS- and other health-related information resources by the organization or by the clients they serve and to implement access to state-of-the-art AIDS-related information tools via the Internet. This may require the purchase of hardware (computer equipment), software, or contractual relationships necessary to obtain a connection to the Internet for the purpose of accessing AIDS-related information or sharing AIDS-related information;<br /><br />2. Skills Development: Training to develop skills in accessing or using HIV/AIDS-related information including the use of online databases and general AIDS information resources in order to improve services and benefit the community. This may include training for the staff of the agency, development of training programs for clients and patrons, training programs for other agencies, etc. ;<br /><br />3. Resource Development: To support an organization to meet the needs of their clients or communities by developing specific educational or informational materials such as culturally or language specific fact sheets, bibliographies, guides or other products; and/ or <br /><br />4. Document Access: Access to HIV/AIDS-related documents and other types of health information. This may include the development of connections with local health sciences libraries to obtain use of their collections, to procure interlibrary loan services, etc.<br /><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></strong><br />It is anticipated that the period of performance shall be for a twelve (12) month period from the date of award. Awards are anticipated to be made on or around August 1, 2010.<br /><br /><strong>Other Important Considerations<br /></strong><br />The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.<br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:
<p>(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above.

CCP is the web-based, real-time, workflow enabled, personnel and payroll management system providing electronic initiation and processing of military personnel actions, computing compensation and maintaining personnel and payroll records for Active Duty and Retired Officers of the Commissioned Corps. The CCP system provides a full range of services from call to duty through retirement.</p>
<p>Commissioned Corps Compensation Branch (CB). CB collects records, maintains files, audits individual payees, performs payroll transactions using CCP and administers a system of basic pay, allowances, and special or incentive pay for active duty Corps. CB also administers a pay system for retired officers and survivor annuitants. The Branch provides these services in coordination with the Departments of Defense (DOD), Veterans Affairs, and Treasury.</p>
<p>Office of Commissioned Corps Operations (OCCO). The Office of Commissioned Corps Operations collects records, maintains files, and performs personnel related transactions using CCP.</p>
<p>In general, it is expected the Contractor shall provide pay and personnel maintenance services that supports the active duty and retired Corps Officers. The pay and personnel maintenance services must be able to handle the collection of source documents, determination of all pay categories, gross-to-net calculations, and interface with all the various internal and external systems required to ensure the accurate disbursement of funds, meet all reporting needs and maintenance of all related IT systems. Once successfully implemented, the system needs to be kept current: both for routine pay table adjustments and for changes to pay calculations as mandated by the Secretary of HHS or Congress. The vendor is expected to draw on their established methods, best business practices, and Government/industry experience.</p>

The Associates Program consists of: 1) providing three cohort classes to participating TSOs (preferably at airport facilities); 2) credit for life experience; and, 3) fulfilling general education and degree program requirements.

<DESC>Request for Information: Courier Services for the Transportation of Laboratory Specimens

THE PURPOSE OF THIS RFI IS SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE SOLICITATION.

The Veterans Affairs ("VA") Great Lakes Acquisition Center ("GLAC") requests your response to this Request for Information ("RFI") for VISN 12 wide Courier Services for the transportation of Laboratory specimens. The VA's VISN 12 current courier services are being provided under a Reference Laboratory contract that is due to expire this spring. The VA recognizes a continued need for these services and wishes to determine whether any small businesses have current capability to perform these services.

Purpose of the contract: The purpose of the contract is to provide VISN 12 medical facilities timely laboratory specimen transportation to the designated locations.

Scope or mission of the contract: The mission of this contract is to provide the safe and timely transportation of laboratory specimens to and from VISN 12 Medical facilities in accordance with the draft statement of work in Attachment A.   The scope of the contract is to provide laboratory specimen transportation on the 44 courier routes identified in Attachment B (Courier Routes) within the requested timeframe.  

Of utmost importance is the contractor's CURRENT ability to comply with: 1) all local, state, and federal transportation regulations for the transporting of Hazard Material Class 6, Division 6.2, as defined in 49 CFR Part 173.134; and 2) VA Information and Information Security/Privacy Requirements (as outlined below).  No ramp-up time for a small business to bring itself into compliance with these requirements will be provided under the contract.

Place and period of performance: Courier services are to be provided for the entire area of VISN 12. VISN 12 service area consists of the whole state of Wisconsin, upper Michigan, northern Illinois, and eastern Indiana. The contract is anticipated to have a one (1) year base period with four (4) option years.

Background: The Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Services (PaLMS) has developed a system of delivery schedules and times to ensure laboratory specimen integrity and adequate turn-around times. Attachment B (Courier Routes) provides the locations and schedules necessary to meet VISN 12's requirements. The VA envisions a system where the contractor will provide the scheduled pick-up of laboratory specimens and deliver the specimens to the designated VA Medical Center or VA Hospital within the required timeframe.

Any information provided in response to this Request for Information will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected.  Responses to this Request for Information are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Vendor participation in this response or any informational session is not a promise of future business with the VA.

Attachment A is the DRAFT Statement of Work. Please provide any comments you have on this DRAFT document. Of particular interest is any specification or requirement that may preclude you from bidding on the forthcoming Solicitation. The VA does not represent that any specific comment or suggestion made by you will be incorporated into the final Solicitation. The VA is gathering your comments and suggestions for review, but ultimately a decision regarding the requirements contained in the final Solicitation is held strictly within the discretion of the Department.

<p>This is a market research survey for a potential contract to advance state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in DIRECTED ENERGY PHased Array System Engineering Research (PHASER) technology development associated with phased array beam control solutions. SOCs that address contributions to phased array performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability and affordability goals, or which enhance performance or significantly reduce cost, schedule, or risk of existing technologies are being sought. SOC's should address phased array Beam Control solutions for fuselage conformal high energy laser (HEL) weapons that provide ultra-responsive pi-steradian coverage of diffraction limited performance and exploration of existing and innovative approaches that lead to phased array beam control solutions. Phased array technologies of interest housed in government facilities at Kirtland AFB include high resolution imaging, coherent beam combining, wavefront sensing, beam projection, and phase sensing within each sub-aperture, system level beam control architectures to include atmosphere and target, and acquisition, pointing, and tracking. The essence of this research will be to realize scalable beam control architectures to enable conformal HEL weapons. These efforts potentially involve a significant amount of time to be spent in a government laboratory and associated modeling facilities at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, NM This includes computer-based modeling and simulation, laboratory experimentation, as well as field testing and evaluation. Phased array technologies of interest outside of the Laboratory's purview include multiple aperture beam combining, phased array imaging, and beam control. These efforts are expected to be conducted at government and the respondent's facilities with the potential for field testing of technologies on government test ranges.</p>

<SOLNBR>N0016407D8907
<ARCHDATE>02222011
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:amber.neal@navy.mil">POINT OF CONTACT</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/crane/working/contracting/default.aspx. 
FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Contracting webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. 

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division has an existing five-year contract with Technology Services Corporation (TSC) of Los Angeles, CA for the Engineering support for the AEGIS Microwave Tubes, AN/SPY-1 and MK99.
 Efforts include performing engineering analyses and recommending changes to existing microwave tube baseline configurations, manufacturing processes and operation parameters.  The requirement also includes support for statistical research and evaluation of microwave tube components including design and proof of design for specialized pieces of military microwave tube test equipment.  

Contract N00164-07-D-8907 was awarded to TSC on 01 April 2007.  It is a five-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The five year ordering period ends 31 March 2012.  At the time the contract was awarded the ship build program for the DDG 51 class destroyers was concluded.  In FY 10 the ship build program was reinstated and the support required from this contract was increased.
  Therefore, there is a need to negotiate a contract modification to increase the dollar ceiling of this contract.  The ordering period will remain unchanged.
 
The solicitation for the original contract was issued utilizing other than full and open competition procedures under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), One Source or Limited Sources.  An offer was solicited from Technology Service Corporation (TSC), 1900 Sepulveda Blvd STE 300, Los Angeles, CA 90049-3456.  The modification will be negotiated utilizing other than full and open competition precedures as well under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).

It has been determined that the Government requirement for this service can only be met by one company due to the contractorâ€™s unique knowledge, expertise, and experience with the historical in-depth knowledge and engineering expertise of all AEGIS  microwave tubes, vendors, and critical systems interfaces.
 This unique knowledge could not be duplicated within the two-year time period for completing the current Product Improvement Programs (PIP).  The costs of trying to duplicate this unique knowledge could not be expected to be recouped in competition.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract modification requirements based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

A solicitation will not be issued as the Government will be negotiating a modification to an existing contract.
  This notice is a synopsis and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Navy to procure subject services. The POC is Amber Neal, Code CXMR, at 812-854-8539 or email amber.neal@navy.mil. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.  Submitting a bid from the NECO website by clicking on the â€œSubmit Bidâ€ does not guarantee offers will be received by the proper person in the correct format.  It is the responsibility of offerors to submit offers to the POC at NSWC Crane to be considered.

<DESC><strong>Sole Source Authority:<br /></strong>The Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) specifically exempts USPTO from the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA - 41 USC 253).
<p><strong>Reason for Sole Source:<br /></strong>Only one responsible source: the supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Contract Award Date: <br /></strong>January 6, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis: <br /></strong>The United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office intends to issue a sole source&nbsp;Blanket Purchase Agreement&nbsp;to Race Corporation for financial management systems subject matter expert (SME) with emphasis on the Federal acquisition process, the applicable Momentum Acquisitions functionality within Momentum Financials, and the associated integrations and components including the Vendor Self Service (VSS) component, and integrations between Momentum and VSS, FedBizOpps, and the Federal Procurement Data System.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary P. Brown of the Race Corporation possesses a unique combination of knowledge, experience and expertise not available from any other source. Her unique qualifications are detailed below:</p>
<p>From January of 1990 to December of 1999, Mrs. Brown worked as a civil service senior procurement analyst in the USPTO's Office of Procurement. Her accomplishments include assisting in the implementation of: the Federal Financial System (FFS), the USPTO's first automated financial system; Procurement Desktop (PD) the USPTO's first fill-fledged automated procurement system; the Internet Purchasing Application (IPA), the USPTO's first electronic commerce system; and Program Office Desktop (POD), the precursor to Momentum Financials. All of these implementations required extensive knowledge of USPTO's business practices and procedures for conducting FAR transactions; a detailed understanding of each system's functionality; and keen analytical skills. During this time, Ms. Brown was also responsible for reporting within and outside the USPTO on completed FAR transactions. During her ten years in the Office of Procurement, Mrs. Brown expanded her existing knowledge of the Federal procurement process and gained extensive experience implementing, utilizing, and maintaining Federal procurement and related systems.</p>
<p>In December of 1999, Mrs. Brown began working in the Financial Systems Division (FSD) of the Office of Finance. Because of the above described experience, she became the System Development Manager (SDM) for PD. This role required detailed knowledge of PD's functionality; an understanding of the USPTO's Office of the Chief Information Officer's (OCIO) system implementation and maintenance requirements; the aptitude to analyze and resolve complicated user issues; the ability to work cooperatively with the software vendor; and a talent to bridge the gaps between different organizational objectives. In a short time, Mrs. Brown was also designated as the SDM for POD. She continued in this role when the USPTO retired FFS and moved to Momentum Financials, and maintained this responsibility until her retirement in February of 2005. Also, from early 2004 until the time of her retirement from civil service, Mrs. Brown worked extensively to prepare for the Momentum Financials upgrade and the Momentum Acquisitions implementation.</p>
<p>Following her retirement, FSD retained Mrs. Brown's services which included: preparing for the Momentum Acquisitions implementation; providing training and user support to the Office of Procurement and the delegated Contracting Officers prior, during, and after the implementation; identifying and resolving system issues; testing system functionality; and preparing for maintenance releases, upgrades, and the Vendor Self Service (VSS) implementation.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends tomodify contract N66001-05-D-0004 with Rosser Marine and Charter Company, Inc.in order to increase the estimated level of effort by 21,682 labor hours,increase the cost plus fixed fee and extend the contract ordering period.  Thecontract provides for vessel operations, maintenance and repair of a governmentowned research vessel.  The contract was awarded on 3 February 2005 againstsolicitation N66001-04-R-0047 with a 5 year period of performance for 84,675labor hours.A solicitation for the follow-on competitive acquisition was issued on 11January 2010.  Proposals were received on the 18 February 2010 closing date andare under evaluation.  The current contract was modified to allow for continuedservices during the follow-on acquisition, however it requires a modificationto provide continuation of support until the follow-on competitive action isawarded.  It is anticipated the follow-on contract will be awarded in July2011.The Government intends to increase the ceiling estimate to 106,357 labor hoursand it is expected that the ceiling increase will satisfy program requirementsthrough July 2011, which is the anticipated timeframe required to award the newcompetitive contract.  If the contract is not modified, the Government will bewithout essential services that maintain and repair an aging vessel, as well asservices that operate the vessel which supports a mission critical sonobuoyprogram.  Interruption of these services would result in compromises to theon-board systems and preservation of the ships structural surfaces, andunacceptable delays in meeting critical operational capability deploymentdates.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.  Adetermination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to thisnotice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Questions concerningthis sole source procurement action may be directed to the Contract Specialist,Jill Mahdessian at jill.mahdessian@navy.mil or telephone (619) 553-5853.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The solicitation number is W911W6-11-T-0005 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). Under this number, the Army Contracting Command (ACC) / Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award only one firm-fixed-price contract for the 5 baseline material samples. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1000. AATD intends to purchase representative samples of commercially available armor materials in current use by the United States Armed Services. The samples are desired to have a single-hit ballistic limit V50 velocity of 1950 feet per second (100m remaining velocity) against a 7.62 x 39mm Type PS Ball at the lowest possible areal density. It is anticipated that the lowest areal density will vary by material. The panels solicited shall be constructed in multiple square geometries using optimized laminate material compositions. This procurement intends to purchase targets constructed from 5 baseline materials. Additionally, options shall be individually provided for Tensylon and BT-10 material compositions and may be exercised based on availability of funds. Each of the materials shall be fabricated in homogenous sample sets that optimize the areal density against the intended threat. It is anticipated that processing parameters shall vary with each type of material. In order to minimize variability, it is required that the processing conditions be kept constant regardless of panel geometry, per sample set, per material. Any deviation from this requirement needs to be identified by the offeror in their proposal. No coverings or coatings are required to be applied to the panels, and the panels are to have finished/cut edges suitable to prevent delamination or other damage to the laminate quality. The panels shall be individually marked, denoting the material composition, panel size, and areal density. The provided samples shall have a square geometry for all panels with outer dimensions as identified below. The intent is to double the plane area of target size with each increasing target size (i.e., 64 in2, 128 in2 , 256 in2, etc.). Some allowance for these exact dimensions may be allowed to permit a more optimized manufacturing process. However, this deviation must be identified and requested by the offeror in their quote. The geometric tolerance for all panels shall be   .125" from the specified dimensions. Baseline materials are as follows: Dyneema HB-50, Dyneema HB-80, Spectra Shield II SR-3130, Spectra Shield II SR -3137, and Kevlar. The optional materials are BAE Tensylon and DSM BT-10. The following panel sizes in inches apply: 6 each 8 x 8, 6 each 11.31 x 11.31, 6 each 16 x 16, 6 each 22.63 x 22.63, and 6 each 31 x 31. Six (6) panels will be supplied per panel size in each of the 5 different baseline material compositions shown above along with the option for the two additional materials, for a total of 30 panels per baseline material composition, 150 panels overall, and options for an additional 60 panels. Shipping charges shall be included in the quote. All samples, whether base or option, shall be packaged to ensure safe delivery to destination point. Delivery of the baseline material samples is expected to be 6 months After Receipt of Order (ARO). Delivery of the option samples is expected to be 6 months ARO, or when option exercised. It is anticipated that either the option exercise or a separate order will be exercised/awarded within 5 days of the original award. Delivery, Inspection, Acceptance, and F.O.B Point are Destination. Destination is the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, AATD Warehouse, Bldg 3519A, Mulberry Island Road, Attn: Ryan Harris, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition without addenda.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2011-060-JML and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48 (December 30, 2010).</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541990 with a size standard of $7.0M and is a small business set aside.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to award a fixed price purchase order for the following:</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Due to the recent appointment of the NIDCR Director to the position of Principal Deputy Director of NIH, the NIDCR Deputy Director is now serving as Acting Director.  Furthermore, the individual providing senior administrative support for the immediate office of the NIDCR Director left with the former Director.</p>
<p>The NIDCR requires a short-term contract with an individual who can provide immediate, substantive, and high-level support to the NIDCR Acting Director on a wide range of high profile activities.</p>
<p>The work requires a professional with deep and broad familiarity with NIH and NIDCR, NIDCR's research portfolio, extramural programs, and the extramural community, who is also organized, motivated to work independently, and a polished writer.  The individual would need to be able to step in and provide immediate support to the NIDCR Acting Director/Deputy Director.  The temporary services needed for the endeavor will require a person of highly professional training and demeanor, with specific dental knowledge and training an added desirable quality.  Knowledge and experience in dental public health residency programs, especially from an administrative experience, would be particularly helpful.  Knowledge of issues relating to the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps would also be advantageous, as the current Acting Director/Deputy Director has a number of responsibilities in that arena.  Finally, the current Acting Director/Deputy Director has just been named NIH liaison to the Indian Health Service, so familiarity with that agency would be advantageous.</p>
<p>The purpose of this purchase order is to secure professional services of an individual sufficiently qualified to play a major administrative role in the NIDCR, providing critical assistance to the Acting Director/Deputy Director for a number of high profile activities as the Institute is preparing to transition to new leadership.</p>
<p>Scope of Work/Tasks</p>
<p>-	Provide high-level support to the Acting Director to support comprehensive oral, dental and craniofacial research programs - covering diverse aspects of dental research, public health, and dental education.  These efforts include independently gathering data/information, compiling and analyzing information, assisting in the preparation of reports, reviewing and editing reports highly technical in nature, and providing substantive input.</p>
<p>-	Assist with high-level professional staff functions critical to the coordination and completion of tasks, including preparing agendas, materials, and providing staff support for high-level meetings, task forces, and committees.</p>
<p>-	Review and analyze reports, scientific findings, and other information pertinent to the duties of the Director.</p>
<p>-	Assist in preparation of presentations by independently gathering information and drafting materials.  These presentations will be to diverse audiences, including NIH leadership, academic and professional groups.</p>
<p>-	Provide guidance and substantive technical support to the residents participating in the Dental Public Health residency program on the progress of their research projects, and provide advice to the NIDCR Acting Director on all aspects of the administration of the residency program, including the 2011-12 admissions process.</p>
<p>-	Provide input and staff support on projects, committees, and presentation related to the US PHS.</p>
<p>-	Provide input and support on issues and ad hoc projects and committees that arise as a result of the liaison role with the Indian Health Service.</p>
<p>The estimated end date of the project will be September 30, 2011.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>-	Written summary of discussion and resulting decisions/plans agreed upon, due within thirty (30) days of estimated date of contract award.<br />-	Brief (one page or less) monthly report listing activities conducted.  Reports shall also alert Acting Director to needs or decision points anticipated for the following quarter.</p>
<p>-	Summary report of activities and accomplishments completed under this contract due within thirty (30) days of close of contract.</p>

The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Questions &amp; Answers: &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />1. The SF18 states CLIN 0001 delivery date as 6 Jan 2011. We know this is not possible. What is the delivery date for CLIN 0001? <br /><br />1A. Delivery date is negotiable. Proposed delivery date should be based upon a reasonable time frame that accounts for the amount of time necessary to develop and produce a requirement of this scope. <br /><br />2. Is there better drawings available than what is depicted in the SF18. If not then are there photos available of a current CTR Tool Trailer being utilized at Barksdale AFB? <br /><br />2A. No pictures are available since it is only a concept and not currently in use. A site visit will be conducted to assist prospective contractors.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE<br />FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.</p>
<p><br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>

Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.

<p>This CRFI is part of ongoing government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this CRFI. The government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition strategy. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent required. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The government reserves the right to not reply to information received.</p>
<p>The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition strategy. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to further engage industry in the effort through interactive Industry Days to gather additional information to support on-going market research, (2) to assist the Air Force in developing innovative low risk technical and business approaches to maximize compliance with approved operational requirements while achieving rapid operational fielding at affordable acquisition and ownership costs, and (3) to identify sources that can provide capability that satisfies the government's current requirement to deliver HH-60 Recap capability and CVLSP capability in either a combined package or as separate efforts. As described in the previous CRFIs, the Air Force is planning to acquire up to 112 new helicopter systems to recapitalize its aging HH-60G fleet and up to 93 new helicopter systems to replace the UH-1N fleet.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>Reference previous announcements PIXS6396, originally posted 17 December 2009 and updated 13 December 2010, and PIXS6470, originally posted 23 March 2010 and updated 10 December 2010. The Air Force will conduct Industry Days to discuss the HH-60 Recap and CVLSP programs, as indicated in the 10 December 2010 posting to support the Air Force's on-going market research process. The Air Force seeks to gather information on innovative business approaches that provide the potential for efficiencies by leveraging common aspects between programs announced in the referenced previous market research SSS/CRFI releases. The Air Force also seeks to understand how these approaches are advantageous to the Government regarding the rapid fielding of systems capable of meeting minimum operational requirements at the lowest acquisition and ownership costs.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Government received the following comment and question concerning clause K300:</strong> <br /><br />We are concerned about the solicitation provision K300 Use of Non-Government Advisors (ASC/WNZJC) (OCT 2010). But before we can decide whether to lodge an objection, we need the following information. Does the Government have an agreement in place to protect contractor's source selection information and keep it in confidence? Can the Government provide assurances that the information will be protected? <br /><strong><br />The Government has provided the following response:</strong> <br /><br />Reference K300. No proposal information of any type (e.g., technical and cost data) will be released or shared with non-Government advisors. Currently, one non-Government advisor is working with the JPATS T-6A/B COMBS team providing resource scheduling support only.<br /><br />As a condition of the contract between the Government and MacAulay-Brown, the employee has signed a non-disclosure agreement. Additionally, for work pertaining to this effort, the employee has signed a separate non-disclosure agreement. Both non-disclosure agreements pertain to sensitive, proprietary, or source selection data.<br /><br />The Government believes this is sufficient to ensure protection of contractor proposal data.

<CONTACT>Kjulonda L. Ogles, Contract Specialist, Phone 4057395405, Email kjulonda.ogles@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump (Left and Right) Upgrade to KC-135R/T/OC-B (419 aircraft in total).
<p>PURPOSE<br />The C/KC-135 Aircraft Sustainment Branch Contracting Office (GKC/PK), Tinker AFB OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost of developing and installing a 3 and/or 10.0 GPM Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump Upgrade(Left and Right) to meet all of the requirements in Table 1. This solution shall address meeting requirements in Table 1 and should not be limited to replacement of both the left and right pumps. The optimal solution would provide an independent onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure and capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems during ground operations. The hydraulic pump solution should be capable of accepting DC power for the purpose of charging the brake system for aircraft movement.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION<br />The KC-135 R/T/OC-B hydraulic system consists of four engine driven hydraulic pumps (NSN 4320-01-242-5153HS/PN PV3-205-39), one on each engine, that provide 3000 PSI to two separate hydraulic systems at 22.5 gallons per minute (GPM) flow. In addition, there are two auxiliary pumps (NSN 3010-00-5675873RK/PN DO81 (DC Motor), 4320-00-864-8677HS/PN PF24-3906-24ZH4 [Right Pump], NSN 4320-00-768-6345HS/PN 65W01020 [Left Pump]) both rated at 0.76 GPM flow. However, the 0.76 GPM flow from the current auxiliary pumps does not allow sufficient flow to support timely testing of all hydraulic systems. To facilitate ground testing, maintainers are required to run engines/or use the MJ-2A hydraulic test stand and the A/M 32A-86 electric cart. Requiring maintainers to run engines and/or test equipment is time consuming and costly to the Government. Providing an independent onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure and capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems will require a 3 and/or 10.0GPM pump, and would alleviate the use of hydraulic test stand which would result in a manpower savings, avoid engine runs for pre-flight checks that would resulting in fuel savings, and increase aircraft availability to support the warfighter.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking a Government off the shelf or commercial off the shelf solution that provides capability to sustain continuous operation of hydraulic systems on the aircraft without use of engines and hydraulic carts. If these requirements cannot be met, please provide the systems that cannot be supported by the proposed solution.</p>
<p>RESPONSE<br />Responses shall address:</p>
<p>1. Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)<br />2. Install Schedule using three different contract field team lines<br />3. Estimated developmental cost (including nonrecurring engineering and technical data)<br />4. A Kit and B Kit Cost break out <br />5. Estimated installation cost with installation hours (broken down by system)<br />6. The components/methods proposed to be replaced or modified<br />7. The expected reliability maintainability &amp; availability (RMA) improvement of replacement components<br />8. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)<br />9. Description and rational of proposed system capabilities and operation<br />10. Details of proposed replacement components/methods to include, but not limited to, items such as electrical, hydraulic power system requirements, airworthiness certifications actions completed, current usage on other systems or in development, logistics support requirements/availability (parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment, tech data, training, pro and cons etc.)<br />11.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Apache Attack Helicopter Project Office is seeking sources with innovative approaches, designs, or products for a new replacement radar on the AH-64D Apache helicopter.  The AH-64 is the U.S. Army's primary attack helicopter and is designed to fight during the day, night, and in adverse weather.  The AH-64 can be armed with 16 HELLFIRE missiles, a 30mm M230 chain gun, and/or 76 2.75 inch folding fin rockets.  The U.S. Army is close to completing development of new hardware for the current Fire Control Radar (FCR) that is mounted on the main rotor mast above the rotors.  This new FCR hardware will enhance the detection capabilities of the AH-64 as well as reduce the logistical burden, operations and sustainment costs, eliminate obsolescence issues, and improve reliability over the current FCR.  Even with these new updates, a new radar is envisioned with additional design updates and capabilities to assist the AH-64 in effectively operating in previous, current, and emerging theaters of operation.<BR><BR>REQUIREMENTS:  The new radar concept must have an open-systems architecture and be compatible with AH-64D Block I, II, and III aircraft.   Capabilities desired include all weather operation for detection, targeting, tracking, and situational awareness in air, land, and sea environments.   The radar must effectively operate in a high clutter environment simultaneously tracking multiple targets both moving and stationary at varying ranges and Radar Cross Section (RCS) size.  The envisioned target set for this radar will include armored tracked/wheeled vehicles, air defense systems, commercially acquired light trucks/cars, air targets including Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), dismounted personnel, and maritime targets.  Technology and/or systems that provide 360 degree situational awareness and targeting capability, intuitive and/or easy to use displays, no moving parts, light weight, low Radar Cross Section, and aerodynamic improvements over the current FCR are highly desired.  Additionally, it's desired that the radar be capable of supporting radar imagery and target data integration with off platform sensor (UAS), and onboard electro optical sensor imagery to rapidly achieve a fully integrated targeting and situational awareness display to the pilot.  Already proven packages are preferred that will support a two level maintenance concept.  The design/concept must be able to endure in a high vibration environment, meet Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) including Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) requirements and not interfere with the aircraft safety, adversely affect aircraft weight and balance limitations nor interfere with existing systems.  <BR><BR>The U.S. Army seeks qualified vendors to provide conceptual papers, design information, technology availability, maturity, identification of risks, product descriptions, support requirements, reliability data including Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) data addressing all or any part of the requirements or discussion points detailed above.  Additionally, the U.S. Army is seeking sources with a strong background, history, and/or past performance in streamlining and facilitating rapid acquisition, addressing obsolescence, enhancing USG-contractor interactions, and containing costs with comprehensive cost controls.  Innovative ideas and solutions are strongly encouraged especially regarding testing and use of modeling and simulation during system development.  Interested vendors are encouraged to provide substantiated evidence of their capabilities and successes in the areas cited above.  <BR><BR>All interested qualified sources are encouraged to submit written notification of their interest, qualifications, and technical concepts to the Contracting Officer, Nicole Sullivan-Williams, (256) 313-4237, e-mail address is nicole.sullivan-williams@peoavn.army.mil.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Suspense is 90 days after synopsis.<BR>

<DESC>MRAP VISUAL SENSOR MARKET SURVEY<BR><BR>A.  DESCRIPTION OF INTENT<BR> <BR>The Program Executive Office Combat Systems and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&CSS), Joint Program Office Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (JPO MRAP) is conducting a market survey to collect written information from Industry to ascertain the current market's capability to integrate visual sensors onto the MRAP family of vehicles.<BR><BR>The Army seeks to improve situational awareness for Warfighters within the MRAP vehicle.  This situational awareness system requires an upgrade to the current suite of visual sensors to increase visibility of the surrounding environment.<BR><BR>The parameters of the desired visual sensor cameras are as follows:  <BR><BR>The visual sensors must contain both a daytime color and infrared visualization capability.  It is assumed that each sensor includes two cameras: one for color daytime capability and one for infrared capability.  If a single camera can accomplish both capabilities simultaneously, references to separate cameras can be assumed to apply to the single camera.  Both cameras must have a horizontal Field of View (FOV) no less than 40 degrees; and, a vertical FOV no less than 30 degrees. The daytime color camera must detect an upright, stationary adult in fair weather no less than 180 meters away; and, the infrared camera must do the same no less than 250 meters away.  The sensor must reside upon a mechanical pan-tilt system with a pan range of no less than 360 degrees (continuous) and tilt range of at least +90 / -30 degrees elevation.  The daytime color camera must output analog video in accordance with SMPTE-170M-2004 with a minimum resolution of 768V x 494H; whereas, the infrared camera must output analog video in accordance with SMPTE-170M-2004 with a minimum resolution of 640V x 480H.  The sensor unit must provide a serial control interface via RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485 half duplex; and, the pan-tilt unit must provide a control bus interface via RS-485 half duplex.  The sensor and pan-tilt unit must have Built-In Test (BIT) capability for fault detection/isolation. The latency from either camera must not exceed 35 milliseconds from point of image capture to distribution on a video or data network.  The sensor unit must be ruggedized to military standards.<BR><BR>Respondents should be companies that have proven capabilities as a vehicle system integrator and can ruggedize sensor technologies to military standards.  This survey is not intended to address individual technologies, rather we are interested in the sensor package as a whole that meets all parameters above.    This survey does not aim to address immature technological capabilities.  Respondents should include information regarding production readiness and justification of stated capabilities.<BR><BR>B.  GENERAL INFORMATION<BR><BR>The submission of information in response to this market survey is for planning purposes only; and, it must not be construed as a commitment by the United States Government to procure any items or services described herein, or for the Government to pay for the information received.<BR><BR>Respondents that cannot address all of the market survey questions in this RFI need not respond.  Receipt of an incomplete market survey will not be reviewed.<BR><BR>***UNITED STATES (US) AND FOREIGN COMPANIES WHO WISH TO RESPOND TO THIS SURVEY SHALL BE AWARE OF AND BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH EXPORT CONTROLS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN ARMS REGULATIONS.***<BR><BR>Participation in this market survey is strictly voluntary and the U.S. Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation in this survey.

<DESC>Solicitation No. VA-244-11-IB-0036, Amendment 2 - 1/6/2011
Building 58 - Replace Doors, Frames and Hardware

Pre-Bid Questions:

1.	Are the doors / frames fire-rated?  If so, what rating?  The answer provided on 12/21/2010 (Q.2) is being modified.  The new answer is stated below.
Answer:  All doors will be 20-minute fire-resistance rated by construction, but not labeled.
2.	For the hallway smoke/fire door pairs:  schedule indicates 45 minute fire rating.  To achieve this, NFPA requires self-closing/self-latching operation.  The scheduled hardware does not provide for positive latching, i.e. vertical rod fire exit devices.  Please clarify the requirements.
Answer:  NFPA 101 does not require latching devices or panic devices for cross-corridor doors in smoke barriers.  The project requirement for 3/4-hour (fire-resistance rated) labeled doors in the smoke barrier is being removed.
3.	Are there any hazardous materials that we may come in contact with during the course of this project?  The answer provided on 12/21/2010 (Q.23) is being modified.  The new answer is stated below. 
Answer:  There is potential for underlying paint to be lead-based on all original tile walls.  This applies to the door frames of rooms 114, 219, 220, 232 and Women's Area 231-239.  All frame removals for these rooms must be done by EPA certified lead renovators or the equivalent to ensure proper procedures are followed.

<DESC>This is modification 3 to the Request for Information (RFI) entitled REQUEST FORINFORMATION FOR TRAJECTORY SOFTWARE FOR LOW EARTH ORBIT AND BEYOND LEO ANALYSIS DESIGNAND REAL TIME OPERATIONS which was originally posted on 5-13-10. You are notified thatthe following changes are made:This is a reposting of solicitation number NNJ10HD001L that was posted in May of 2010 bythe Flight Dynamics Division (FDD) of NASA at JSC.  The FDD is partnering with theMission Operations Facilities Division and our software contractor to meet its trajectorysoftware requirements.	For this reason we are reposting this request for information. Companies that submitted a response in May are not required to resubmit.  The intent ofthis RFI is to perform market research in an attempt to build a viable vendor list forMOD.This is an RFI only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASAwill take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA nor the Governmentwill be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.This RFI is being used to gather research for NASA to make decisions regarding trajectorysoftware for analysis, flight configuration, and real time operations work.  This RFIapplies to software that include many of these core capabilities in both Low Earth Orbit(LEO) and beyond LEO environments:Core CapabilitiesTrajectory modeling, prediction, and controlTrajectory determinationTrajectory simulationVisualization and Plotting6 Degree of Freedom (DOF) Simulation (i.e. translation and rotation) or interfacing withan external 6 DOF SimulationRFI responses must include: Section 1o  Name of the primary point of contact for the responseo  Business titleo  Company affiliationo  Email addresso  Phoneo  Identification of other key individuals who collaborated on the RFI response Section 2: A brief summary description, not to exceed one page, of the candidatesoftware as it relates to the core capabilities listed above. Section 3: Include past and/or existing customers and their contact information, ifavailable. Section 4: Numbered responses that correspond with their respective question listedbelow.Overview:The Flight Dynamics Division at JSC uses trajectory software to execute various tasksspanning mission analysis, flight configuration, and real-time operations.  These tasksare performed in an environment, which at times, is very dynamic and has very highprocessing demands.  In addition, the actions taken by the user, or those they supplywith information, have safety critical implications.  The individuals using thetrajectory software will in some cases work in an isolated environment and in other caseswill work in a distributed multi-user environment.  In order to understand how wellsuited the candidate software is for use in this context, we need to understand thedesign approaches employed by the software.  NASA's desire is to get short responses thatinclude what features the software has that address these concerns, or a short suggestionon how the software may be complemented to address these concerns.The approach employed in this evaluation is based on concepts from the SoftwareEngineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon, which developed approaches for evaluating howwell suited a software system is for an environment based on several key qualityattributes.  The quality attributes to be addressed are the Availability/Reliability,Ability to Modify, Performance/Scalability, Security, Testability, and Usability of thecandidate software when placed in our environment.  This RFI is concerned about thearchitecture of the software suite and the elements of that architecture that addressthese concerns.Some of the capabilities required to address the quality concerns expressed in thefollowing list will not be provided directly by the trajectory software.  In the caseswhere there is no direct support, the analysis should turn to how the software has beenintegrated with other components that do provide the required capabilities.  Forinstance, the trajectory software may not provide a transactional database, but maysupport a database interface. Another example may be that the trajectory software may notdirectly support any messaging protocols, but provides an adaptor mechanism for accessingapplication data so it could be distributed through a messaging bus.  So the intent ofthis analysis is to determine what elements of the trajectory softwares design directlyor indirectly enable us to address these quality concerns.NASA is requesting information about the design approaches and technologies employed bythe software as they relate to the following quality concerns:Quality ConcernsAvailability/ReliabilityAbility to ModifyPerformance/ScalabilitySecurityTestabilityUsability Keywords:Open Source, ground trajectory sub-system, Trajectory Domain Functions, Earth ascent, LowEarth Orbit, Inter-planetary coast, Inter-planetary orbits, Near Earth Orbits, Earthentry, Vector Input and Manipulation, Trajectory Prediction, Trajectory Maneuver Planningand Targeting, Rendezvous and Jettison Planning, Trajectory Optimization, CollisionAvoidance, Orbit Determination, Vehicle Acquisitions Planning, Trajectory Evaluation,Trajectory Constraints Verification, Command Data Generation/Viewing, WorkflowAutomation, Attitude Timelines, Maneuver Predictions and Calculations, Tracking and DataRelay Satellite System (TDRSS) Scheduling, Trajectory Sub-System Integration, PlatformIntegration, Data Management, External Systems Integration, Six Degree of FreedomSimulation Integration.No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.Response Submission Deadline:Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than 11:59 PM Eastern Standard Time, onJanuary 21, 2011.  RFI submissions will be accepted as e-mail attachments only.  Allresponses must be sent to john.r.carpentier@nasa.gov, with Traj RFI Response andNNJ10ZHD001L in the subject line.

<DESC>Citrix is the only known source capable of meeting the requirement as described herein.  NITC owns and administers a Citrix server farm used to support all major applications including GIS, Maximo, Circuits, and all database development and administration access.  This farm consists of 810 Citrix Xenapp licenses that require a support contract.  Citrix is imbedded into the IT infrastructure so the continued operation of this software is a requirement.  NITC requires a vendor support maintenance agreement for the Citrix server farm in order to maintain IA compliance and ensure it can properly support the Citrix environment. NITC will be unable to apply security patches as required by the IAVM without a maintenance support agreement.
The contract term is one (1) year with a one (1)-year option period, for a total of two (2) years.
The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.
  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, inquiries received within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  The Governmentâ€™s determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the Governmentâ€™s discretion.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Particulars:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Atmospheric Programs, Climate Change Division, intends to conduct a competitive Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15 procurement under solicitation number SOL-DC-11-00003, Technical and Outreach Support Services for Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program Development and Implementation.  This procurement is full and open.  Award will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is determined to offer the best value to the Government.  The NAICS Code for Environmental Consulting Services is 541620 and the current size standard is $7.0 million.  The Government contemplates multiple award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity contracts as a result of the solicitation.  More specifically, the Government intends to award no more than four contracts as a result of the solicitation.  The anticipated period of performance will be a one-year base period with four one-year option periods.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is on  or about January 24, 2011 with a solicitation closing date on or about February 23, 2011.  Please do not contact the contracting office prior to the projected issue date.  The solicitation will identify the deadline for submission of any questions pertaining to the solicitation requirements; any questions submitted after that deadline may or may not be responded to at the option of the Government.  All responses to questions, clarifications, and/or comments deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer will be promulgated via amendment(s) to the solicitation.  Offerors are advised to monitor the EPA Website and the Federal Business Opportunities Website for issuance of the solicitation and to download any amendments issued during the solicitation period.  No paper copies will be furnished.  Please note, on June 21, 2010 a Sources Sought/Request for Information notice was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities Website (www.fbo.gov).  
Background:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a rule for the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases (GHG) (also referred to as 40 CFR Part 98) from large GHG emissions sources in the United States. The implementation of the rule is referred to as the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).  40 CFR Part 98 applies to direct greenhouse gas emitters, fossil fuel suppliers, and industrial gas suppliers. In general, the threshold for reporting is 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent per year. Reporting is at the facility level, except for certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases.  An estimated 85-90 percent of the total U.S. GHG emissions from approximately 10,000 facilities are covered by this final rule.  This comprehensive, nationwide emissions data will provide a better understanding of where GHGs are coming from and will guide development of the policies and programs to reduce emissions. In addition, this publicly avai lable data will allow reporters to track their own emissions, compare them to similar facilities, and aid in identifying cost effective opportunities to reduce emissions in the future.  The subject procurement is primarily intended to support the work for the continued finalization of 40 CFR Part 98 and implementation of the GHGRP.  
Scope:
	The purpose of this procurement is to provide support to the Climate Change Division.  The work to be performed under this statement of work corresponds with the task/functional areas listed below.	A.	Technical and Engineering Analyses SupportB.	Regulatory Program and Guidance Development SupportC.	Outreach, Communications, and Training Support D.

Background:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a rule for the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases (GHG) (also referred to as 40 CFR Part 98) from large GHG emissions sources in the United States. The implementation of the rule is referred to as the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).  40 CFR Part 98 applies to direct greenhouse gas emitters, fossil fuel suppliers, and industrial gas suppliers. In general, the threshold for reporting is 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent per year. Reporting is at the facility level, except for certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases.  An estimated 85-90 percent of the total U.S. GHG emissions from approximately 10,000 facilities are covered by this final rule.  This comprehensive, nationwide emissions data will provide a better understanding of where GHGs are coming from and will guide development of the policies and programs to reduce emissions. In addition, this publicly avai lable data will allow reporters to track their own emissions, compare them to similar facilities, and aid in identifying cost effective opportunities to reduce emissions in the future.  The subject procurement is primarily intended to support the work for the continued finalization of 40 CFR Part 98 and implementation of the GHGRP.

Three airports and three community colleges were partnered. Classes were held for Baltimore-Washington International airport (BWI), Reagan National&nbsp;Airport (DCA) and expanded to San Antonio International airport (SAT) in January, 2009. The completion rate during the first semester at BWI and DCA was 96%. The continuation rate (those continuing into the second semester) was 78%.<br />The total student population consists of approximately 60,995 TSOs. Of this number, less than 10% have an associate's degree or higher and only 21.4% have any higher education credit.<br />The purpose of this program is to achieve professional excellence through educational opportunities for the TSO workforce. The Associates Program consists of: 1) providing three cohort classes to participating TSOs (preferably at airport facilities); 2) credit for life experience; and, 3) fulfilling general education and degree program requirements.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 13.106(b)(1), FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii).

1. 	Agency:  South Texas Veterans Health Care System, Audie L. Murphy Division and the
VISN 17 Contracting Office (10N17/671C), 7400 Merton Minter, San Antonio, TX 78229.

2.  Description of Action:  Description of Action:  ACOS for Research is currently addressing â€œThe VA Career Development (CDA-2) Study of Dr. Karen Block entitled â€œRole of NAD (P) H Oxidases in Renal Cell Carcinomaâ€ (Protocol 0712-001).  An extension for service is required between the STVHCS/ALMD Research & Development and XENOGEN Bioscience ( Now known as TACONIC)  to generate a novel Transgenic Animal Model over-expressing p22PHOX in Renal proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells in an inducible manner during the period of 1 November 2010 through October 31, 2011 and one (1) option year 1 November 2011 through October 31, 2012.  


3. Description of Service:  Generation of genetically-modified mice. The CDA-2 Award held by the applicant is focused on the role of p22phox-based Nox oxidases in mediating renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  It has been determined that p22phox is up-regulated early in human RCC and may be an important step in the pathogenesis of this kidney cancer. To this end, our work has progressed from in to in vivo animal model.  Here, we have designed a transgenic (Tg) mouse strategy to over-express p22phox in the proximal tubular epithelial cells (the cell type in which RCC is derived) of mice (Tg p22phox) to examine the phenotypic changes that occur in this tissue. Additionally, our transgenic strategy incorporates an inducible gene driven by doxycycline. This strategy is a novel approach to understand the mechanisms by which p22phox-based Nox oxidases contribute to this cancer. XENOGEN Bioscience/TACONIC is a known agency with advanced technologies in generating animal models of this nature. The design, construction and generation of a transgenic mouse are a multistep processes that are delivered in phases and compensated for as progress of the project is made.  The estimated length of time to generate the mice is ~1.5 years and another 0.5-1 year to screen the lines for proper functional analysis. The estimated value for this service is $40,000.00. 

4.  Authority:  IAW FAR 13.106(b) (1), FAR 6.302-3(a) (2) (ii) and with statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B) and 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (3) (B).

5.  Proposed Contractors Unique Capabilities: XENOGEN Bioscience/Taconic offers custom generation of a wide range of mouse models, using a variety of advanced technologies - enabling the users to obtain the precise models needed. Through a powerful combination of industry-leading technology in mouse genetics and genomics and unrivaled expertise in breeding and distribution, Taconic provide easy access to the tools needed, in understanding the contributing mechanisms to diseases. Taconicâ€™s has an excellent reputation in delivering generated mice to many institutions in a timely manner. 



6.  Sources Sought Effort:  There were no vendors listed in FSS for this type of service. The Governmentâ€™s efforts to stimulate competition were shown in its issuance of a Fed Biz Ops notice on October 26, 2010.  As a result of the posting no interest was generated.  This requirement was advertised with intent to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 6.302, as required by FAR 5.203.  However, it was noted that if a firm believed it could meet these requirements they were to furnish information about their services, as well as references from other customers who have utilized their services.  Supporting evidence was to be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement.  The Government asserts its standing that this requirement can only be provided by XENOGEN Bioscience/TACONIC.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. 
       

7.  Determination of Price Reasonableness:  Search results in GSA Advantage E-buy, Fed Biz Ops, and the Internet provided no sources for a reasonable expectation of ability to provide this type of service. The need to contract for this particular animal model was determined by STVHCS research mission and current market rates. Also taken in consideration were STVHCSs research expertâ€™s opinions and the costs sustained by the contractor. The cost to the Government for this service is determined to be fair and reasonable.  

8.  Market Research:  ACOS for Research has indicated that there is no comparable service available commercially that provides Transgenic animal models of p22phox expressing in an inducible or constitutive manner in proximal tubular epithelial cells, nor is there an animal model for the cause, development, and effects of a disease for kidney cancer in the scientific community. 

9.  Other Facts: This is a follow-on research program that requires using the same contractor to maintain experimental consistency.  The change in contractor using different techniques is likely to skew the results of the experiment and invalidate the results of the project.  Doing so would be a waste of time, effort and funding.  Previous PO# 671-D50046, D95133)

10. Listing of Sources:  Not applicable.   

11. Statement of Action to Remove Barriers to Competition:  Only one responsible source is intended under authorities of FAR 6.302-3(a) (2)(ii), 13.106(b)(1). 

12. I hereby certify that the justification provided is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>NA
<ARCHDATE>01212011
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>OVERSEAS CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>1.I recommend that Embassy Mexico City use of "Programas Especializados Oc&eacute;anica, S.A. de CV," other than full and open competition for the acquisition of Training Services for the Project of In-Patient Primary Care, Out-Patient Care and Management Sensitization on Addictions for Federal and State Penitentiary Facilities in Mexico. The estimated cost is $250,000 representing proposed training for the first 3 quarters of the calendar year 2011. Additional training needs may require additional funding, however, since this is a brand new unique pilot program that is being implemented for the first time in Mexico and is of critical national importance, NAS Mexico will revise an overall long term program strategy once the pilot training has undergone significant stages where the impact is measurable.</p>
<p><br />2.Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>This program is being sponsored under the Anti Drug Merida Initiative. The Ministry of Public Security (SSP), The Institution in charge of federal efforts fighting drug trafficking, is a key interdiction partner in the implementation of the initiative. Another important component of Merida calls for the adoption and support of Demand Reduction initiatives that contribute to contain the expansion of the local drug trade. This program bridges both interdiction and demand reduction strategic objectives. By enabling improved care of inmates with addiction problems and associated co morbidities, the SSP adds a new element of prevention and care to its interdiction program. It has been shown repeatedly that prison inmates are among the population groups with the highest risk of substance abuse. Addiction and drug use recidivism are much more prevalent among former prison inmates that among many others at-risk groups. It is in the interest of NAS, and its Merida partners to undertake any actions that limit the consumption of drugs, especially where this support may be more effective. There are clear advantages and reduced social costs in treating addictions within prisons, as incentives for corruption and violence are reduced. These services will have a maximum cost of US$250,000.00</p>
<p>The program consists of the adaptation of Oce&aacute;nica&acute;s addictions care and prevention model o the needs of the penitentiary population. The Programs include diagnostic studies, evaluations, training, Train-the-Trainer sessions and technology/model transfers to State and Federal Penitentiary Facilities on:</p>
<p>&bull;Primary In-Patient Addictions Treatment and Prevention<br />&bull;Out-Patient Treatment for Substance Abuse and associated comorbidity <br />&bull;Sensitization for Management, Custodians, Security Personnel and other Technical Staff on Substance Abuse</p>
<p>The social need for this type of training is crucial and there is an impending urgency as this segment of the population has been underserved. If the addiction is not addressed within this segment, the likelihood of repeat offenses is extremely high. As yet, only one Federal Penitentiary of all Penitentiary system in Mexico has tackled the issue of drug restriction within the inmate population. Therefore, this remains of high social need and a critical item on the current administration's priority list. This supports and supplements the prison reform Merida funded program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs</p>
<p>This program directly falls under "Pillar IV" of the Merida Initiative strategic policy document. (Pillar I: Disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations in Mexico. Pillar II: Institutionalize reform; Pillar III: Build a 21st Century Border Infrastructure; Pillar IV: Build Strong and Resilient Communities). Under the Merida Initiative, Mexico is to receive $1.4 billion in assistance, managed by NAS Mexico City. As part of that, one priority is to reduce Mexican demand for drugs, which is an increasingly urgent problem that destroys families and communities, plays into the hands of drug traffickers and increases violence in both our countries. <br />Specifically, this service will provide prevention and addiction treatment to a very vulnerable population, currently underserved. The benefits will be multi-fold, in terms of reduced violence in prisons, and strengthening the families and communities of convicts.</p>
<p>This directly supports NAS Mexico's mandate under Pillar IV of the Merida Initiative.</p>
<p>4.An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <br />10 USC 2304 (c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements</p>
<p>5.A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited).</p>
<p>Management Approach and Technical Capabilities</p>
<p>a.The only existing prevention and treatment program in all of Mexico's prison system was developed and developed by Oceanica. It has proven success and impeccable track record in reducing the rates of addiction, recidivism among that prison's population (Oce&aacute;nica's overall Recovery Index rate is approximately 74%, a success rate achievable only through in-house, permanent programs like the one proposed by Oce&aacute;nica). This is an excellent example of what the Merida Initiative seeks out to achieve. In addition, this particular program supports Pillar IV by building stronger, resilient communities (Please refer to discussion in Paragraph 3 above).</p>
<p>b. While there may be other addiction treatment models that contractors could implement in Mexican prisons, Oceanica is unique, as it has a proven record of qualifications that include cultural sensitivities, and which caters specifically to the population that the Merida Initiative is targeting. No other program in Mexico is qualified to do a comprehensive module implementation. Additionally, this is the lowest-price alternative, as compared to US providers.</p>
<p>c. Within the Mexican market, Oceanica's model is the most competitive and technically acceptable. Oceanica's competitors remain owners of their technology and models. Oceanica works with a train-the-trainer model that fully transfers it to the penitentiaries. Based on data provided by our Mexican implementing partner, the National Ministry of Public Security (SSP), other organizations normally retain copyright and other intellectual property-related powers, which would significantly increase costs. Adoption of Oce&aacute;nica's technology that uses the Train-the-Trainer approach which would leave a team of implementers at each site. c.</p>
<p>Oc&eacute;anica also has the infrastructure to simultaneously implement training programs all over the country, including enough trainers on staff.</p>
<p><br />This addresses the issue of long-term sustainability, which is required by the Merida Initiative and is within NAS Mexico's Congressional mandate.</p>
<p>Past Performance Factors</p>
<p>Oc&eacute;anica has uniquely relevant experience in the specific area (federal prisons) where the services will be actually rendered:</p>
<p>a. Oc&eacute;anica has conducted assessments, training and other technical assistance for the development of competencies for the staff at the Federal Prison No. 5 "Oriente", the "Centro Federal de Rehabilitaci&oacute;n Psicosocial" and the Federal Prison Compound "Islas Mar&iacute;as" specifically on handling and treating inmates and others with problems of substance use. Programs included training on technical issues and skill development on treatment and prevention.</p>
<p>b. The approach used at the three facilities was developed with the specific intent to gather data throughout the process and create a full methodology and protocols that respond to the special issues arising from the implementation of addictions training and treatment programs in federal prisons.</p>
<p><br />6.A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. The description should include whether a FedBizOps notice was or will be publicized, as required by FAR 5.2, and if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies (e.g., blanket waiver provided in DOSAR 605.202-70).</p>
<p>In soliciting the expertise of established GOM anti-addiction and penitentiary authorities, NAS Mexico City has come to understand the supply of providers in the Mexican market. In doing so, we talked to our partners in the Mexican Secretary of Public Security (SSP), in charge of federal prisons, the National Council Against Addictions (CONADIC, a body of the Secretary of Health), and the National Institute of Psychiatry, in charge of drug treatment and prevention policy implementation.</p>
<p><br />7.A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The amounts provided by Oce&aacute;nica have been revised by our partner, the Federal Ministry of Public Security and The Program Managers with the NAS interdiction and demand reduction team. Given the extent of the services to be provided, the limited travel costs and the actual technology transfer of Oce&aacute;nica&acute;s model, we deem this proposal to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>In addition, Oceanica's personnel would live at the penitentiary, further decreasing costs and travel. This additionally addresses specific issues related to the prison environment and allows for further tweak the model. The end result is that Oc&eacute;anica would not have to devote as much time and resources in the development of the processes and protocols for implementation in prisons, and that the same approach could be used at other federal or state facilities later on.</p>
<p><br />8.A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.</p>
<p>No full market survey was conducted directly by NAS. The SSP has provided information on Oce&aacute;nica's competitors and provided the rationale for their selection. In addition, other options and the main features of their treatment models are known to the Drug Demand Reduction and Medical communities in Mexico.</p>
<p>9.Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.<br />N.A</p>
<p><br />10.A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>N.A</p>
<p>11.A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.<br />N.A.</p>
