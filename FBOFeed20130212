The Government intends to issue sole-source follow-on Interim Contracts for AFLCMC's Engineering and Technology Support Service (ETASS), Advisor and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS). ETASS follow-on interim contracts will be awarded to Jacobs Technology Inc. Jacobs Technology is currently providing support via Task Orders under ETASS (FA8721-07-D-0015).<br /><br />The Enterprise Acquisition Division (AFLCMC/PZM) proposed to execute, by means of other than full and open competition, request for proposals/contracts to the above listed contractor for a total period of 11 months (six (6) months base period and up to five (5) month extension period). The total contract ceiling will be $85.5M. The current ETASS Task Orders expire on 19 May 2013. Upon expiration of the current task orders, the Air Force will not have Advisory &amp; Assistance Services available to meet the service level required to rapidly address war fighter needs by providing Engineering and Technology Support Services to support approximately&nbsp;400 AFLCMC systems and programs. The required interim contracts are to provide necessary time for award&nbsp;of the new ETASS II contract vehicle(s), and to continue to provide AFLCMC critical Engineering and Technology Support Services without experiencing a lapse in service. <br /><br />The interim contracts will provide coverage within the originally competed scope of the current task orders without changing the SOW requirements. These interim contracts will provide disciplined systems/specialty engineering and technical support using established Government, contractor, and industry processes that encompass the practices and requirements of the AFLCMC Engineering Directorate (EN) framework.

<DESC>Title: National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation Continuing Training and Materials Maintenance Project
<p>&nbsp;Background and Need</p>
<p>CDC currently funds approximately 240 community based organizations (CBOs) and health departments (HDs) to provide HIV prevention programs. The Program Evaluation Branch (PEB) within the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) has promoted the use of the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) variables for standardized data collection and reporting for national and local HIV prevention monitoring and evaluation. PEB has also provided an optional web-base software, the HIV Prevention Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS), to assist grantees. The collection and analysis of standardized HIV prevention evaluation data allows CDC to report on HIV prevention efforts at the national level. Funded agencies are required to report the NHM&amp;E required data and either use PEMS or other CDC-provided software for data submission to CDC or submit data compliant with NHM&amp;E requirements and formats to satisfy the terms of their cooperative agreements. PEB also promotes the use of data for monitoring and evaluation at the local level. The PEMS software provides functionality for grantees to track their program efforts and review their own data for program monitoring and improvement.</p>
<p>Three large-scale software training sessions consisting of 18 meetings, each a week long, to train about 15 people each week, were conducted after each of the first major releases of the PEMS software. One representative from participating health departments and community-based organizations received the software training and related materials in order to train their staff members. Each of the training sessions focused specifically on technical skills required to implement PEMS. In addition to software training activities, CDC conducted training on HIV prevention program data collection strategies and required variables.</p>
<p>A lesson learned from these experiences was that grantees need continuing, integrated training. The training should:<br />&#61607; focus on collecting and using the NHM&amp;E data,<br />&#61607; emphasize how required data can be used for program evaluation and monitoring activities, <br />&#61607; focus on activities necessary for using PEMS or other data collection software, <br />&#61607; assist grantees to improve program planning, management, and delivery of services.</p>
<p>Due to high turn-over rates among these organizations and agencies, many participating HDs and CBOs may currently have no staff trained in NHM&amp;E or to use PEMS software, contributing to great variation in the level of implementation of evaluation and use of the PEMS. Staff may also not have an understanding of CDC's data requirements and how data can be used for improving HIV prevention programs. Hence, CDC is currently in the process of developing NHM&amp;E training materials and presentations to cover a wide variety of needs. The goal is to develop web-based training materials that can be used by grantee staff on an as-needed, on-demand basis as self-paced learning, materials that can be used in webinars and other electronic training media, materials that can be used electronically or printed by grantees for their own use in conducting training for their own employees or contractors or as reference, and to develop and deliver training in a variety of settings (e.g., in-person, electronically, etc.). The task order to develop the initial set of materials and deliver these trainings ended December 31, 2009. A follow-on task order will end February 25, 2011. A four-month task order to keep work going through June 30, 2011 is in process. The proposed contract includes the development and completion of remaining training modules.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the NHM&amp;E requirements are evolving as the epidemic and program monitoring needs change, and since the PEMS software will also be modified or replaced to accommodate grantee requests, changes in requirements, and improvements in system function, there is also a need to continue developing the NHM&amp;E training and to maintain and improve the components of the training. This is the basis for this NHM&amp;E Continuing Training Development and Maintenance Project contract request.</p>

<DESC><p>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br /><br />PR Number: IQC12318009006 Various Commercial Fasteners<br /><br />The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is transforming the way it orders, receives, accounts for, and distributes commercial fasteners in FSC 5305, 5306, 5307, 5310, 5320, 5330, 5331, 5340, 5355, and 5360, for its customers. The intended award shall be a Commercial Fastener Tailored Logistics Support (TLS) Program contract. In order to transform these functions, DLA will need an integrated supply solution strategy that relies on a level of contractor support that includes forecasting collaboration with customers, total supply chain management, distribution/warehousing, quality control, customer direct support, compliance with Time Definite Delivery (TDD) timeframes, data management, and achieving a minimum material availability of 90% at the start of the contract progressing to the minimum acceptable level of 95% in year 4.<br /><br />There are approximately 6000 items listed on the Price Evaluation List of items (formerly identified as the Core List of items) that will be evaluated and awarded under this solicitation. Offerors must submit offers on at least 90% of the Price Evaluation List items to be considered for award on any Price Evaluation List of items. Each item will be evaluated and awarded utilizing Best-value, Tradeoff Source Selection Procedures. Offers submitted on an "all or none" basis will not be considered for award. The Government will make one award to the responsible offeror, whose offer meets or exceeds the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation, and whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and past performance. Past performance is significantly more important than cost or price. In addition, the Government has identified approximately 199,636 additional items that may be added to the resultant contract on a post award basis via the Add/Delete Clause. The contract maximum dollar value is $84,064,538.09.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 19.102 (f)(5) this acquisition is being solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside with a Waiver of the Non-Manufacturer Rule. The Non-Manufacturer Rule requires that the actual manufacturer or processor be a small business concern. This applies to all items that are fully competitive or for which a domestic small business manufacturer or processor exists. Thus, the Waiver of the Non-Manufacturer Rule applies only to those items where no known domestic small business manufacturers or processors can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the requirements of the solicitation. <br /><br />This solicitation requests offers on a customer direct basis only. Pricing for all items must be FOB Destination, with the exception of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) items requiring FOB Origin and Inspection/Acceptance Origin. <br />Delivery is for customer direct support in compliance with TDD timeframes. TDD according to Issue Priority Group (IPG) is as follows:<br /><br />IPG I = Requisition Priority 1, 2 or 3<br />IPG II = Requisition Priority 4 - 8<br />IPG III = Requisition Priority 9 - 15<br /><br />Delivery = IPG I - 2 days<br />IPG II - 5 days<br />IPG III - 12 days</p>
<p>This solicitation will contain Surge and Sustainment (S&amp;S) requirements. <br /><br />Buy American Act Certification applies.<br /><br />There are items contained in the solicitation that have the Qualified Supplier List (QSL) requirement. Only manufacturers/suppliers on the QSLM/QSLD will be eligible for an award pursuant to this solicitation. Note: The dealer (if applicable) and the manufacturer will need to be QSL certified at time of award. Therefore, inspection and acceptance on QSL items will be at destination. However, the Government reserves the right to Source Inspect any item.<br /><br />Material Pricing: Fixed material prices are established and are subject to an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) pursuant to Clause 52.216-9030. Offerors are required to furnish pricing fixed material prices, on at least 90% of the line items in the price evaluation list, which will be subject to an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) pursuant to Caluse 52.216-9030. The government guarantees that the successful contractor will receive, at a minimum, compensation equal to 10% of the estimated three year base dollar value of the contract excluding incentives and disincentives.<br /><br />Services Fees: These fees are only incurred to receive or issue the inventory transferred from DLA. Fixed Pricing is established for the level of performance to support demands over a 5-year ordering period, to include a 3-year base ordering period, and one (1) 2-year option period. All service fees will be paid out against the referenced additive CLIN. Service fees are priced as follows: <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transition Fee:</span> The contractor will be reimbursed for receiving and storing material transitioned from DLA's inventory. A flat cost per receipt will be established to cover the costs to receipt and stow DLA inventory transitioned to the contractor's plant. The total amount will vary with the number of shipments of Government-owned material made from the Depot to the Contractor. The fee is applicable throughout the entire contract. Contractor will bill monthly for receipts processed. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Material Release Order (MRO) Throughput Fee:</span> The contractor will be reimbursed for issuing material from the inventory transitioned from DLA and shipping to the DLA customer. A flat cost per order shipped will be established to cover the costs to receive the Material Release Order from DLA, pull DLA material from contractor's shelves, and package and ship (including transportation) the DLA material to the customer. The total amount will depend on the amount of inventory transitioned from DLA to the contractor, and customer orders. The fee is applicable throughout the entire contract. Contractor will bill monthly for orders shipped. <br /><br />Contractor performance will be governed by Fill Rate Metrics. Performance will be evaluated at the end of each performance period to determine compliance with the metrics and to compute the amount of incentive/disincentive the contractor earned for that performance period. This will be detailed in the Statement of Work (SOW) in the solicitation. <br /><br />The contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with a base period of 3 years and 1 two-year option period. An Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) will apply to the option period in accordance with DLAD 52.216-9030 set forth in the solicitation. <br />The solicitation is scheduled to issue on February 28, 2013. The date is subject to change. A copy of the solicitation and all attachments including, but not limited to, the item description pages, pricing spreadsheet, surge and sustainment NSN requirements, historical 5-year demand data, wholesale inventory level at warehouses, and the universe of items will be available via DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) as well as the following website:<br />http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Hardware.</p>
<p>All responsible sources will be able to submit a proposal which will be considered by DLA Troop Support.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent Synopsis for a sole source noncompetitive award to Inova Health System, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA for the NIH-Inova Pulmonary Vascular Program: Dedicated to the Reversal of Pulmonary Hypertension and Advanced Lung Disease.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the NHLBI/DIR Cardiovascular-Pulmonary Branch intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source noncompetitive basis for the NIH-Inova Pulmonary Vascular Program: Dedicated to the Reversal of Pulmonary Hypertension and Advanced Lung Disease to Inova Health System, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) specifically the Vascular Medicine Branch of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) required the development of an Advanced Lung Disease Program (referred to as "Program") dedicated to the management and study of patients with the various forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)at the National Institute of Health (NIH) contracted with Inova Health System, Inova Fairfax Hospital to establish a collaborative Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) program. <br /><br />The program utilizes Inova's current facilities and the Heart Institute's clinical practice and research abilities. NIH has a long history of an established integrative clinical research approach. Its Pulmonary Vascular team in the Vascular Medicine Branch of the Heart Institute consists of physicians with expertise in pulmonary, hematology and cardiovascular diseases, all critical components in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. Inova-Fairfax Hospital has a well established Pulmonary Hypertension Program with clinicians and coordinators skilled in the management and care of patients with various forms of pulmonary vascular disease. The program combines the NIH and Inova Pulmonary Vascular Program has provided substantial benefits for both institutes and the affected patient population. All patients recruited through NIH for study purposes would have the option of being followed/managed clinically through the Program. Inova would provide the day-to-day clinical management and care with the collaborative assistance of NHLBI.</p>
<p>This is a follow-on contract of the previous Inova Health System contract (Contract No. HHSN268200700032C) which established the program for the management and study of patients with various forms of pulmonary disease. Inova is the only contractor that can perform this work since they have established the program and need to perform the research studies. In support of the Program, Inova is in the development of an ongoing NHLBI asthma treatment clinical trial, as well as on three additional NHLBI clinical protocols. The Inova Fairfax Advanced Lung Disease Program will actively recruit patients with pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, sarcoidosis, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis, to NHLBI clinical protocols. This will include inclusion of NHLBI clinical protocols in mailed announcements by the INOVA Fairfax Advanced Lung Disease Program. Inova Fairfax Advanced Lung Disease Program physicians will provide clinical coverage and management of pulmonary hypertension and other advanced lung disease patients in the Monday NHLBI Pulmonary Hypertension Clinic. Inova Fairfax Advanced Lung Disease Program physicians will provide clinical guidance regarding the management of NIH pulmonary hypertension patients, as well as other advanced lung diseases, in both in-patient and out-patient settings. NIH will have access to all patients evaluated at Inova for possible patient enrollment in NHLBI clinical trials and care of Inova patients in NIH clinical trials.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2018 ((1) one-year base period with four (4) one-year options).</p>
<p>The basis for the sole source determination is based upon the fact that: Inova Health System, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA is the sole source for the follow-on contract for the continuation of the NIH-Inova Pulmonary Vascular Program: Dedicated to the Reversal of Pulmonary Hypertension and Advanced Lung Disease. Inova has a well-established Advanced Lung Disease and Pulmonary Hypertension Program with clinicians and coordinators skilled in the management and care of patients with various forms of pulmonary disease. Inova is the only contractor that can perform this work since they have established the program and need to perform the research studies. Inova actively participates in the evaluation, management and enrollment of severe asthmatic patients into NHLBI clinical research protocols. Inova has an important role in the recruitment of severe asthmatic patients to NHLBI research studies. Inova serves as NIH's primary conduit for patient recruitment and referral from the Northern Virginia medical community and has facilitated the recruitment of severe asthmatic patients on several levels. Thus, the contract/program has been very important for the recruitment and referral of severe asthmatic patients to NIH research studies. Further Inova has referred patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and congenital heart disease to NHLBI. Lastly, the INOVA Fairfax Advanced Lung Disease Program has also supported other NIH clinical research protocols and has referred over 443 patients for participation.</p>
<p><br />This acquisition is conditioned under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1 (b), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 622310 - Speciality (except Psychiatric and Substance Abuse) Hospitals with a size standard of $35.5 million.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being request and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract on a sole source noncompetitive basis for the NIH-Inova Pulmonary Vascular Program: Dedicated to the Reversal of Pulmonary Hypertension and Advanced Lung Disease to Inova Health System, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation will be subsequently issued. <br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director, Office of Research Information Systems (ORIS) intends to solicit proposals from capable Offerors for a wide range of systems engineering services to support the grants management system for the ORIS Electronic Research Administration (eRA). <br />Background<br />eRA systems align with Grants.gov (the one-stop web portal for finding and applying for federal grants), allowing for full electronic processing of grant applications from application submission through closeout of the grant award. eRA systems provide a suite of 28 modules supporting end-to-end grants administration. The entire eRA Enterprise with all of its independent systems shares a common data model, residing within an Oracle database platform. The hardware architecture is a combination of Windows NT and UNIX servers. The application architecture is a web enabled multi-tier J2EE environment. The development activities in the eRA program follow the eRA Software Development Life Cycle methodology which is based on the Department of Health and Human Services Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC).<br />Objectives<br />The goal of the resulting procurement is two-fold: (1) to provide a practical solution for eRA system engineering support services for eRA in all program areas (software maintenance, new initiatives, and integration of HHS and other agencies) , and (2) to meet the needs of the end user community and their expectations for service. The preponderant amount of the work is increasingly maintenance and enhancements of existing systems, and new functionality that spans across multiple systems. The eRA strategy for accomplishing these goals has been to restructure from individual project teams to a customer focused service team approach.<br />Offerors shall be able to provide information technology (IT) services necessary to support the Electronic Research Administration (eRA) in the business and requirements development; IT architecture support regarding data, application software, network, and hardware eRA entities; IT security system and functional testing of software; configuration management; software development support; documentation and training support ; and implementation of systems that are designed to accommodate NIH and DHHS initiatives. Offerors shall be able to provide the above-mentioned services for all designated eRA program modules throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). <br />Characteristics of the eRA systems engineering requirements include:
<p>&bull; Project Planning Support<br />&bull; Business Analysis and Requirements Development<br />&bull; Application Architecture<br />&bull; System and Integration Testing<br />&bull; Configuration Management<br />&bull; IT Security<br />&bull; Design Support<br />&bull; Software Development Support<br />&bull; Production Support<br />&bull; Documentation Support<br />&bull; Training Support<br />&bull; eRA Infrastructure Support</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria<br />1. Offerors shall have experience in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing business and requirements development to support Federal grants management business processes<br />&bull; Providing IT architecture support regarding data, application software, network, and hardware <br />&bull; providing functional and performance testing during the software development lifecycle (SDLC)<br />&bull; Providing configuration management<br />&bull; Providing software design and development support<br />&bull; Providing documentation and training support</p>
<p>2. Experience as a prime contractor for a Federal grants management system similar in size, scope and complexity to the eRA program is an absolute requirement and a key success indicator.</p>
<p><br />Proposals submitted in response to the pending solicitation will be evaluated on the following factors:<br />Technical Solution - The Offeror will be evaluated on how well the proposal meets the eRA project objectives, considerations, and constraints, and complies with NIH IT standards and guidelines. <br />Technical - Management Solution - The Offeror will be evaluated on how well the Offeror provides a tailored approach to perform task management for this effort. <br />Technical - Personnel Solution - As part of this factor, the Government will evaluate the resumes submitted for each of the Key Personnel proposed.<br />Past Experience and Performance - The offeror must have demonstrated experience as the prime contractor in providing architectural, business analysis, testing, and configuration management for Federal grants management systems similar in size, scope and complexity to the eRA requirements, and will indicate the likelihood of the Offeror's success.<br />Small Business Involvement - As part of this factor, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's plan for including small, disadvantaged, women-owned, and veteran-owned businesses as part of their solution to meeting eRA Systems Engineering program requirements.<br />Transition Plan - As part of this factor, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's plan for a successful and orderly transition from the current contract. <br />A Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available electronically on www.fedbizopps.gov or about March 1, 2013. Responses to the RFP will be due 30 days after the release of the RFP.<br />ORIS anticipates the award of a single contract for one base year with five additional one year options. ORIS may award a cost reimbursement and/or fixed price contract. <br />This pre-solicitation notice is not a request for a proposal. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for any information provided in response. This notice will close on February 27, 2013.

The work includes but is not limited to:  lawn care, mowing and trimming, edging, vegetation control, debris removal, shrub and hedge maintenance, plant maintenance, application of herbicides, pest control and Snow Removal and Deicing Operations.

The work identified is to be provided by means of a combination Firm-Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity type of contract.
   Source Selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that provides the lowest price and is technically acceptable to the government. Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Method.  In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology.  Proposals will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest price to highest price).  The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the five (5) lowest priced proposals.  The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal from among the five (5) lowest priced proposals.  If no proposals are found to be technically acceptable within the first group of proposals, then the process described will be conducted again as many times as necessary, until such time as the Government identifies a technically acceptable proposal.
 .  Accordingly, under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.  Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss or revise their proposals.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both non-price and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.

The solicitation and resulting contract award will be a performance-based service acquisition made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposals (RFP), will be advantageous to the Government price and other evaluation factors considered.
  The offerors proposal shall contain a response to each of the evaluation factors and shall be in the form prescribed by the solicitation. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors:  Factor 1  Technical Approach/Management, Factor 2  Corporate Experience, Factor 3  Safety, Factor 4  Past Performance.  NOTE:  Offerors MUST be evaluated as technically ACCEPTABLE under factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 in order to be considered technically acceptable overall.





Offers shall be submitted for the performance of work for a period of one year.  However, the initial term of the contract may be for a period of less than one year.  The Government has the option to extend the term of the contract services for additional periods of one to twelve months.
  The total contract term including the exercise of any options, shall not exceed 60 months.  

The proposed procurement will be issued as a NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic Electronic Facilities Support Contract with online ordering capability using DOD EMALL for the Indefinite Quantity Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs).

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in cases when FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. Interested offerors should monitor both the FBO and the NECO site for the release of the solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed. Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.

Disclaimer: This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.
 The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse the cost of any submission in response to this announcement -- the entire cost of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information. If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FedBizOpps/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. 

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a single solicitation in March 2013 for the MK 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) Launcher Production Contract for (FY13-17) launchers, ancillary hardware, and associated support equipment in support of US Navy, AEGIS Ashore, and Allied Navy requirements.
  This solicitation will encompass separate mechanical and electronic MK 41 VLS requirements.  The Government may award separate contracts for the mechanical and electronic requirements from this one solicitation or the Government may award a single contract for both the mechanical and electronic requirements.

The MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) is installed onboard United States Navy (USN) surface combatants (CG 47 and DDG 51 Class ships) and multiple allied Navy platforms. MK 41 VLS stores, selects, prepares for launch, and launches STANDARD Missile, TOMAHAWK, Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC), and Evolved SEASPARROW missiles. 

USN DDG 51 Class launchers consist of 12 modules composed of eight cells each.
 Allied Navy MK 41 VLS launchers typically consist of fewer modules with eight cells each. The FY13-17 requirements consist of up to 120 modules (10 USN DDG 51 Class shipsets), 3 AEGIS Ashore modules, up to 48 Allied Navy modules, and VLS upgrade kits and spares for Aegis Modernization (AMOD) and DDG modernization programs. The FY13 - FY17 DDG 51 Class module production requirements are planned to be procured via multi-year contracting concurrently with the FY14 AEGIS Ashore and Allied Navy requirements under the mechanical and electronic Firm Fixed Price contracts. The AMOD Mod kit requirements, starting in FY14, will be via annual contracting with base plus option requirements procured under the mechanical and electronic contracts.
 

The requirements under this possible effort are build-to-print and include, but are not limited to, design, fabrication and/or procurement and assembly of all special tooling and test equipment required to manufacture, assemble, and test MK 41 VLS Launchers, ancillary hardware, and associated support equipment. If separate contracts are awarded, the mechanical contractor will be required to procure all mechanical requirements outlined in the solicitation and deliver them to the electronic contractor as GFE after Government acceptance. NAVSEA will provide proprietary electronics as GFE to the electronic contractor. The electronic contractor will be required to procure all electronic requirements outlined in the solicitation and integrate these electronics with all GFE.

Award of the mechanical and electronic requirements will be determined by Lowest Price Technically Acceptable criteria under full and open competition as outlined in the solicitation.
 Offerors may propose on either the mechanical or electronic requirements or both.  If an Offeror elects to propose for both efforts, two individual and separate proposals must be submitted for each of the mechanical and electronic requirements; the Government will not accept a combined mechanical/electronic requirement proposal. NAVSEA may award one Firm Fixed Price contract for mechanical requirements and a separate Firm Fixed Price contract for electronic requirements, or one Firm Fixed Price contract for both the mechanical and electronic requirements. Offerors who propose for both efforts may be awarded either the mechanical or the electronic requirements, or both in the event that each individual offer is selected under the source selection criteria.
  

For example:

Scenario 1:
Offerors	  Mechanical	Electronic
A	  $10	         $15
B	  $12	         -
C	  -	         $14
D	  $15	         $22
Award	  Offeror A	Offeror C
Under this scenario, assuming all offerors are technically acceptable, mechanical requirements would be awarded to Offeror A and electronic requirements would be awarded to Offeror C.

Scenario 2:
Offerors	  Mechanical	Electronic
A	  $10	         $15
B	  $12	         -
C	  -	         $14
D	  $9	         $11
Award	  Offeror D	Offeror D
Under this scenario, assuming all offerors are technically acceptable, mechanical and electronic requirements would be awarded to Offeror D under one contract. Note that in the event that one offeror is selected for both the mechanical and electronic requirements, the mechanical requirements will be Contractor Furnished Equipment vice Government Furnished Equipment.

NAVSEA intends to fully fund all base requirements in FY14 at the time of award.
 Base contract requirements may include 108 USN DDG 51 Class modules, 3 AEGIS Ashore modules and 2 DDG AMOD kits. The anticipated contract period of performance for this requirement will be from the date of contract award, approximately March 2014, through approximately August 2020 (or upon delivery of all hardware). 

IMPORTANT: To be considered for contract award, all offerors must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary. However, subject to the applicable laws, regulations, and the terms of the solicitation, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. prime contractors. The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

<DESC>The Fleet Logistics Center (FLC), Norfolk, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire  a ceiling amount of 2,500 encrypted DVD (NDVD) players for The Navy Motion Picture Service (NMPS) that are compatible with the existing encryption process used to duplicate and replicate NDVDs of the films for which the Navy has acquired licenses from the respective copyright holder.  FLCs intent is to process this procurement on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Enseo Inc.  Enseo Inc developed the NDVD players currently being used by NMPS in its mission of supplying entertainment to both afloat and shore locations.  Opening this requirement to competition would violate guidelines per the agreement with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), specifically World Airline Entertainment Association (WAEA) Specification 0598, in regards to Early Window Content Motion Pictures.
  The FLCs intent is to issue a firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR 15 (Contracting by Negotiation) procedures.  The ordering period for this contract will be 01 April 2013 through 31 March 2018.  The solicitation will be made available electronically upon its release to www.neco.navy.mil.  The applicable NAICS code is 334118.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<CONTACT>David Plagge

<a href="mailto:plagge.david@epa.gov">plagge.david@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The US EPA intends to procure on a sole source basis with Perkin Elmer Health Sciences, Inc.  an integrated Gamma and Liquid Scintillation Counter (LCS) system.  The requested equipment (a Perkin-Elmer Wizard2 gamma counter and Tri-Carb 2910 scintillation counter) is needed to support analytical research conducted by EPA scientists under both the Chemical Safety for Sustainability (CSS) and Sustainable Community Health (SCH) National Research Program. This suite of equipment will allow researchers to continue to use standardized radio detection systems for quantitation radionuclides and radioisotopes in experimental samples generated in studies in chemically defined systems, cultured cells, and whole animal studies.  Comparability of experimental results across different studies will be facilitated by use of the common analytical platforms and common data processing systems currently in place. The selected instrumentation provides the combination of analytical sensitivi ty and specificity needed to continue supporting research under two national research programs.
In particular, the requested equipment will allow EPA to perform radiometric assays including but not limited to tissue dosimetry,  protein binding competition assays, protein binding competition assays, assessment of metabolites, capacity/activity of cultured cells and 125-I radioimmunoassays, including automated analysis of activity and generation of standard curves for calibration.  The equipment will serve the additional function of fulfilling radiation safety requirements of contamination survey tests.  The attributes of the requested instrumentation are of utmost importance for the success of the research as it will accurately and efficiently evaluate current isotopes being used 109-Cd, 73-As, 3-H, 14-C, 125-I, and 32-P but is not limited to these isotopes.  Additionally, the instrumentation has a broad keV energy range, preset isotope library and ability to add isotopes as well as versatility of variable sample size.  The Liquid Scintillation instrumentation has a samp le load capacity of 408 standard 20ml vials or 720 small vials.  The Gamma counter instrument has 3" x 3" well type thallium activated sodium iodide crystal, radiation shielding for detector assembly of minimum of 2.0 inches and conveyor shielding at minimum of 2.95 inches of solid lead, sample load capacity of up to 1000 samples and is capable of measuring six (6) different nuclides with energy range of 15 ? 2000 keV simultaneously.   Market research by EPA indicates that no other equipment can meet the sample load capacity required, the Gamma counter requirement for the 3" x 3" well type thallium activated sodium iodide crystal, nor the capability of measuring six (6) different nuclides simultaneously.
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this EPA requirement must submit technical documentation to establish its assertion. This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice. Telephone requests will not be honored. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The anticipated award date is March 15, 2013.  EPA requires delivery within six (6) weeks of award.

<DESC>Additional Classification and NAICS Codes:   <br> Classification Code: C -- Architect & Engineering Services <br> NAICS Code: 541330 -- Engineering Services <br>  <br> The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is the Department of Defense (DoD) demonstration and validation program for environmental and energy technologies.  The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative energy technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the ESTCP website.   <br>  <br> The Program Announcement which includes specific topics and complete submittal instructions is found at; <br>  <br> www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/ESTCP-Solicitations/Energy-Solicitation  <br>  <br> No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.  <br>  <br> To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the  instructions on the website, no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 28, 2013.  No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.   <br>  <br> Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by ESTCP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether ESTCP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal.  Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals, ESTCP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. <br>  <br> Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made.  It is expected that multiple awards will be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that awards totaling approximately $10.0 million will result, depending on availability of funds.   <br>  <br> Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value.  If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees and $14M respectively.  Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) Small Business Office website at www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.   <br>  <br> Points of Contact: <br>    <br> Procedural Questions - ESTCP, Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 571-372-6565;  <br>  <br> Technical Questions - Dr. James Galvin, James.Galvin@osd.mil or 571-372-6397; <br>  <br> Contracting Questions - HECSA, Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or 703-428-6420;  <br>  <br> Small Business Participation Plan or Subcontracting Plan Questions - HECSA, Mr. Kyle Beagle, kyle.j.beagle@usace.army.mil or 703-428-7385.  <br>

<CONTACT>Mary G. Gardner, Contracting Specialist, Email mary.gardner@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Subject Matter Expert (SME) support of the Comprehensive Cost and Requirement (CCaR) system for the Air Force Armament Directorate (AFLCMC/EB) and AFLCMC OL staffs at Eglin AFB; Foreign Military Sales within the Armament Directorate (AFLCMC/EB-FMS); the 96th Test Wing of the Air Force Test Center (AFTC/96 TW); and the Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RW) at Eglin Air Force Base. Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis and the Performance Work Statement (PWS) which are included to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of Eglin Air Force Base and the respondent's potential ability to meet the Government's requirements.
<p>The requirements of this task are for the provision of CCaR application support for the unique funding, planning, reconciliation, execution and reporting requirements and interface capabilities with various Government systems and applications for activities associated with Eglin organizations, as well as in-depth experience and expertise to quickly and accurately respond to the wide variety of financial tasks and unique formats required for detailed financial and program related reporting. Contractor personnel must have knowledge of Air Force financial, contracting, and program management procedures, understand the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process, and understand the Requirements &amp; Planning Council (R&amp;PC) process. CCaR support must have familiarity with operating web-based database programs, as well as be proficient in all CCaR applications.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide functional support of the CCaR application. CCaR support provide assistance and support to CCaR Administrators, needed to carry out CCaR administrative functions and CCaR functional tasks which includes, but are not limited to, the following: set-up, configuration, daily operation and training of the CCaR application in direct support to Eglin organizations. CCaR support must have extensive knowledge of the following systems and how they interface with CCaR: Government Accounting and Finance System (GAFS), Automated Business Systems Solutions (ABSS), the Specialized Accounting and Finance Enterprise System (SAFES), Contract Writing Document Preparation (ConWrite), and System Metric and Requirements Tool (SMART); as well as other systems that do not directly interface with CCaR, i.e. Commander's Resource Integration System (CRIS) and Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS). CCaR support shall ensure that the CCaR application is properly tailored and configured to meet the unique requirements of the organization to include reimbursable Government accounting and various Business Management Review (BMR) chart configurations.</p>
<p>This effort will require a current Secret Facility Clearance.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates utilizing Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) CLINs. The Air Force anticipates the ordering period will be a base year and four (4) option years. A multi-year contract allows for reduced staff manpower to initiate and award. This also allows stability with the eventual winner, i.e. able to sign employees to longer term contracts thus generating further efficiencies and best ensuring continuity in the support provided to the Government. Upon award of the option years, the same contractor is ready and able to deliver required services on day one without the need for transition time, or downtime, which again, creates efficiencies for the Government.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541511, size standard $25,500,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall submit a 6-8 page capabilities document. The capabilities package shall be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Provide recent, relevant experience in all areas, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements shall be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements. Include the following in your statement of capabilities: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to AFTC/PZIE (Eglin), Ms. Mary Gardner,mary.gardner@eglin.af.mil no later than March 14, 2013 (date) at 1pm Central Time.</p>
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC>This requirement is based on a rapidly deployed pre-engineered modular substation using readily available pad-mount components including a fixed tap transformer and separate single phase regulators.  It is anticipated that such a design will result in lower costs and shorter lead times.   <br>  <br> OBJECTIVES <br>  <br> The overall objective of this RFI is to improve the government's understanding of industry capabilities and identify qualified sources capable of providing these critical services in support of the purchase and installation of the electrical substation.  Fort Riley reserves the right to utilize information from the responses to this RFI to determine if any business may be applicable to any resultant solicitation.  Responding to this RFI does not automatically qualify the responder to be included on any list, if such a list is developed.  Vendors wishing to submit a response to any subsequent solicitation must monitor FedBizOpps for the synopsis.   <br>  <br> This Request for Information is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government.  This is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  <br>  <br> CAPABILITIES COVERAGE- <br>  <br> Fort Riley seeks to identify vendors that can provide the following required work.  This project is to provide and install a complete and usable above ground outdoor substation, including connecting the substation to existing primary and secondary electrical distribution lines and commissioning of the completed system. The Contractor shall furnish all surveys, engineering, design, labor, equipment, materials, and transportation to perform all required work in accordance with this document: <br> SPECIFICATIONS:  <br>  <br> The new substation capacity shall be at least 5,000 KVA. <br>  <br> The primary side of the substation shall be fed from the existing 34.5kV distribution line, located immediately northeast of the site. <br> The secondary side of the substation shall feed two circuits to the existing 12.47kV distribution line, also located immediately northeast of the site (under built to the 34.5kV).  The 12.47kV line shall be cut and two risers shall be installed so that one circuit will feed to the north, and the second circuit will feed to the south. <br> This requirement is based on a rapidly deployed pre-engineered modular substation using readily available pad-mount components including a fixed tap transformer and separate single phase regulators.  It is anticipated that such a design will result in lower costs and shorter lead times.   <br> MODULAR SUBSTATION <br> Substation Type:  Distribution substation with numerous residential and commercial loads on two 12.47kV feeders serving up to 2,600kVA each  <br> Substation shall be completely assembled, installed and tested. <br> Substation may be completely assembled in the factory and pre-tested prior to shipping and made ready for connection to incoming 34.5kV underground transmission, and outgoing 12.47 kV underground feeder conductors. <br> The substation and all components may be pre-assembled on galvanized steel skids, designed for installation on site-prepared concrete pier foundations; or, it may be assembled and installed on site on poured in place concrete pads. <br> Substation shall include power transformer, regulators, and secondary switchgear with vacuum circuit breakers, reclosing relays, current and voltage transformers, and all associated instrumentation and wiring.  Also provide galvanized steel supports, weatherproof enclosures, control building, mounting skids, anchor bolts, and any other equipment necessary for a complete and usable substation. <br> PRIMARY CONNECTIONS: <br> Recommended point of connection is the existing 34.5kV primary overhead line at pole E1645, located immediately to the east of Building 2620.  The existing 34.5kV line is three 477MCM ACSR overhead cables in a delta arrangement. <br> Pole E1645 shall be replaced with a new pole that is structurally able to support the new tie-in equipment. <br> The new pole E1645 shall include an overhead radial tap to the existing 34.5kV primary line and a new Gang Operated Air Break (GOAB) switch, lightning arrestors, hook stick fuses, shield wire terminations, and riser to transition to underground feed to the new substation.  <br> Underground Distribution: <br> New underground cable shall be 35KV, MV-105, copper conductor, EPR insulated cable with tape shield. <br> Underground cables shall be installed in rigid steel conduit, or PVC conduit encased in concrete. <br> Above grade risers shall be installed in rigid steel conduit.  Transitions from rigid steel to PVC, if used, shall be made below grade. <br>  <br> Power Transformer: <br> Type:  Outdoor, Pad-Mounted, Deadfront  <br> Capacity:  At least 5,000KVA at 55 C rise, no fans <br> (OPTION 1:  7,500KVA at 55 C rise, see section Error! Reference source not found.) <br> Number of Phases:  3 <br> Primary Voltage:  34.5kV <br> Primary Connection:  Delta <br> Secondary Voltage:  12.47kV  <br> Secondary Connection:  Grounded Wye <br> Frequency: 60 Hz <br> Taps:  None <br>  <br> Voltage Regulators: <br> Type:  Self Contained, Outdoor, Pad-Mounted, Dead Front, Single-Phase, Fluid-Immersed, Step-Type <br> Capacity:  At least 167KVA per phase, 500KVA total (10% regulation) <br> Quantity:  3 <br> Voltage:  7.2kV nominal <br> Frequency:  60Hz <br> Regulation:  +/- 10% in 32 steps of 5/8% <br> Secondary Switchgear: <br> Type:  Outdoor, Fully Enclosed, Pad-Mounted, Three-Phase.   <br> Number of Circuits:  One Main and Two Feeders <br> Interrupting Medium:  Vacuum <br> Continuous Current Rating:  600A <br> Interrupt Rating:  12kA <br> Protection Relays:   <br> 1.	Type:  Microprocessor based <br> 2.	Protection shall include: <br> a.	Instantaneous/Time Phase Overcurrent (50/51) <br> b.	Instantaneous/Time Neutral Overcurrent (50/51N)  <br> c.	Recloser (79), required on feeders only <br> d.	Under/Over voltage (27/59)  <br> 3.	Relays shall be fully configurable from the local display and keypad, without the need for a computer interface. <br> Main and feeder circuits shall be metered for voltage (V), current (A), demand (KW) and accumulated energy (KWH).  <br>  <br> Remote Communications/Monitoring:  Meters and Relays shall include integral Modbus communications.  Communication cable shall be installed to connect all devices together to provide a single  quote mark point of connection quote mark .  This Modbus access point will not be connected to the post network at this time, but will facilitate a future connection to the network and the post Energy Management Control System. <br> SECONDARY CONNECTIONS: <br> Recommended point of connection is the existing 12.47kV overhead line at pole E1644, located approximately 200' to the southeast of Building 2620, and immediately northeast of the site.  The existing 12.47KV line is four #4 CU overhead cables in a grounded Wye arrangement. <br> Pole E1644 shall be replaced with a new pole that is structurally able to support the new tie-in equipment. <br> The existing 12.47 line shall be cut at pole E1644 and a new horizontal Gang Operated Air Break (GOAB) switch installed to allow the two sections to be tied together.  On each side of the tie switch, install overhead radial taps to two new hookstick operated switches, shield wire terminations, and riser to transition to underground feed from the new substation.  (Note:  Alternative proposals for the switching arrangement on this pole, including the use of vertical GOAB switches in lieu of the hookstick operated switches, or running the risers up two separate poles, will be considered.) <br> After completion, the standard configuration will be for the tie switch to be open and both riser switches to be closed.  In addition, at pole E1705A west of ESS05, the existing tie switch will be closed and the riser switches opened.  Thus, one of the new substation feeders will feed northwest from pole E1644, effectively taking on the load of existing ESS05 circuit 2 (i.e., circuit 52).  The other new substation feeder will feed southeast from pole E1644, effectively taking on the load of existing ESS05 circuit 1 (i.e., circuit 51). <br> SITE PREPARATION: <br> Project site will be brought up to desired elevation by the Government.  All site trenching, backfilling, compaction, gravel hauling and installation, and concrete work shall be provided by the Contractor.   <br> Foundations: The Contractor shall design and install all foundations and provide hardware necessary to attach equipment skids, structures, electrical equipment, control building, etc. to their respective foundations <br> Underground conduits & ducts: The contractor shall provide all trenching, earth work. Backfilling, compaction, and grading required according to the contractor provided site plan. <br> Contractor shall design and install all components necessary to properly ground the substation and devices. <br> CAPABILITY STATEMENT  <br> Interested parties are requested to submit a capability statement that addresses the following:  <br>  <br> 1.	Ability to perform the tasks set forth in the Capabilities Coverage section described to install a new electrical substation on Fort Riley, Kansas. <br> 2.

<DESC>This announcement is part of a series of Requests for Information (RFIs) for the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) NextGen Weather Processor (NWP) Program.

Background
The FAA has released four prior announcements in the form of a Market Survey and three RFIs.  All four announcements are listed below:
1.	NWP Market Survey #10766
Posted 05/25/2011: The purpose of the market survey was to notify potential vendors of an upcoming solicitation, gain an understanding of the current marketplace, and to enhance the FAA's insight into industry capabilities and best practices regarding NWP.  Interested vendors were encouraged to provide statements of interest and capability.  Attachments included: NWP Scope, goals, and plans; and small business declaration form.
2.	NWP RFI #11141
Posted 09/14/2011: The purpose of the RFI was to 1) Identify potential technical approaches that could meet the FAA's requirements for NWP, 2) Obtain vendors' comments and recommendations regarding the draft Initial Program Requirements (iPR), and 3) Obtain additional industry insight regarding NWP.  Interested vendors were encouraged to submit responses addressing the three items above.  Attachments included: NWP Graphic, Draft NWP iPR, and NWP Program on a Page.
3.	NWP RFI # 11692
Posted 4/9/2012: The purpose of the RFI was to seek industry comment regarding all aspects of the FAAs plans for the NWP system and the information described in the announcement and its corresponding attachments.  Also included were specific questions for industry from the Program.  Attachments included: NWP Government Furnished Information (GFI) Matrix, the NWP Draft System Specification Document (SSD), the FAA Response to Vendor Questions from RFI #11141, the NWP Software and Data Flow Information, and the NWP Draft Deployment Schedule.  
4.	NWP RFI # 12384
Posted 9/26/2012: The purpose of this RFI was to respond to requests by Industry for the NWP Program to release certain draft documentation about GFI software.  The specific documentation released to Industry included: Draft NWP Technology Description; Draft GFI Evaluation Report; Draft NWP Quarterly Code Counts; and ITWS Functionality Summary.

Purpose of this RFI
This RFI seeks industry comment regarding the information described below and its corresponding attachments.  Also included are questions for industry from the program.

This NWP RFI has four parts, as follows:
I.	Draft NWP Requirements Documentation
II.	Draft GFI Software Information
III.	Planned Program Milestones
IV.	Questions to Industry

The program has attempted to provide the most current documentation.  However, all documentation is subject to revision.

Part I:  Draft NWP Requirements Documentation
The following attachments are included for vendor review and comment:
	Attachment 1:	Draft NWP Section C 
	Attachment 2:	Draft NWP Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) & Data Item Descriptions (DIDs)
	Attachment 3:	Draft NWP SSD
	Attachment 4:	NWP Display Requirements Summary

Part II:  Draft GFI Software Information
Industry has requested release of certain information pertaining to documentation about NWP GFI software.  The NWP Program is making available the following documentation as part of this RFI for vendor review and comment:
	Attachment 5:	GFI Package Description
	Attachment 6:	Technical Description Document (TDD)
	Attachment 7:	Product Description Document (PDD)
	Attachment 8:	GFI Evaluation Report
	Attachment 9:	Sample Module Code
	Attachment 10:	Download Instructions

Part III:  Planned Program Milestones
All dates provided below are tentative and subject to change pending Program approval.
	RFI #5  February 12, 2013
	Vendor Meetings  March 2013*
	SIR Release  4th Quarter FY 2013
	Contract Award  3rd Quarter FY 2014
	Test Readiness Review  1st Quarter FY 2018
	Key Site Initial Operational Capability (IOC)  3rd Quarter FY 2019

*Depending on the number of vendor responses received from this RFI; all, some, or none of the vendors may be invited to meet with the FAA for information gathering.

Part IV:  Questions to Industry
1.	Cloud Computing:  With the adoption of cloud computing as an integral component of the Office of Management and Budgets 25 Point Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management (December 9, 2010), the FAA has been exploring cloud computing technology and identifying a potential implementation approach.  The FAAs plan is outlined in a recently developed strategy document FAA Cloud Computing Strategy, version 1.0, May 2012.  The NWP Program is interested in possibly utilizing cloud technology as an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).  Based on the NWP documentation provided above, what would be the benefits and risks to the program if the program were to utilize a cloud-based solution?
2.	Display:  Based on the information provided above (Attachment #4 NWP Display Requirements Summary), what are the risks to NWP if the program were to only use a web-based display?
3.	Duration to Initial IOC:  Based on the information provided above (Attachment #3 Draft NWP SSD), how long will it take (i.e., rough schedule estimate) to deliver all the NWP requirements from contract award to IOC? Please identify any items that would mitigate the risk to reaching IOC.

<DESC>Synopsis:
The Naval Sea Systems Command is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of SEA 05 (Naval Systems Engineering Directorate) and PMS 320 (the Electric Ships Office) seeking information from electrical equipment manufacturers and system integrators for information to support the development of electrical interface specifications for DC power distribution.  The Navy desires industry recommendations for establishing this new interface standard.

Description:
MIL-STD-1399-300B, Interface Standard, Electric Power, Alternating Current was issued on 24 April 2008.  This standard has proven effective in enabling the successful integration of shipboard power system with load equipment.
   An analogous interface standard for DC systems does not exist for voltages between 600 and 20000 VDC.  Equipment and systems with a variety of nominal voltages in this range have been developed over the past 15 years.  To promote commonality and reduce total ownership costs, the Navy is interested in establishing a new section of MIL-STD-1399 for electrical power, direct current.   Of particular interest are recommendations and their rationale for nominal voltages between 600 VDC and 1000 VDC and between 5000 VDC and 20000 VDC, for power quality requirements (analogous to those in MIL-STD-1399-300B and 680 for AC power), for user equipment interface requirements, and for user equipment interface tests.
   These standard interfaces would be invoked in future modifications to specifications such as MIL-PRF-32272 and MIL-PRF-32168.  

Responses:
Responses and comments are requested by 4:00 pm (EST), on April 15, 2013.  However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEAs strategic planning.  Information should be e-mailed to Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil or mailed to Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Joseph Tannenbaum, PMS 320, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376 and labeled with the solicitation number and Electrical interface Specifications for DC Power Distribution RFI.  Questions can be submitted electronically to norbert.doerry@navy.mil or by phone at (202) 781-2520.
 

Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed.  Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies and should not contain proprietary information.  However, if some of the background on the comments provided is considered proprietary to the respondent, that portion shall be segregated and labeled as such and will be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.
  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.
  Follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection or preference.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any is issued.  Classified material will not be accepted.

All dredged material shall be placed within an average placement site of 100 feet next to the dredged channel, see attached site plan.  The placement site starts at least 30 feet from the dredge channel.  An equipment reach capacity of up to 110 feet may be necessary.  A rock closure structure (approximately 4200 tons of riprap) will also be constructed to reduce water velocity near the entrance of the backwater area.  <br>  <br> The placement sites shall be cleared of trees, stumps, down timber, brush, and other debris above the ground surface that would interfere with placing the dredged material.  No clearing of trees with peeling bark greater than 4 inches in diameter shall be allowed between April 1 and September 30 inclusive (the Indiana bat roosting season).  The material to be removed is primarily soft to very stiff silts, sands, and clays. <br>  <br> The entire project site is within the Mississippi River and is therefore highly susceptible to water fluctuations that may impact work progress.  No physical work at the project site shall be required 1 December through 15 March.  Standby cost will not be paid.  Lastly, underwater excavation will not be allowed when water level is above Elevation 595.0.

This construction project has an estimated range of $5 to $10 million.  The construction of this project is anticipated to take multiple years depending on the options awarded.  The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) Code is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction with a corresponding size standard of $20 Million for Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities. <br>  <br> NAICS code 237990 - Dredging: To be considered small for purposes of Government procurement, a firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern. <br>  <br> All interested small business concerns are encouraged to respond to this Sources Sought Notice. Contractors are reminded that THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network 23 Contracting Office, Minneapolis Minnesota intends to award a brand name firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Parts 13 Test Program.   The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing and the size standard is 500 employees. 

This will be a brand name solicitation and the Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract for a quantity of one.  

Minneapolis Midwest Healthcare Network is requesting the purchase of this mass spec instrument as a compliment for the existing Vitek instrument in the Microbiology Laboratory. Mass spectrometry measures particles based on their mass-to-charge ratio. To do this, a sample is exposed to an ion source, and its particles (ie proteins) ionized, separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio, detected and then the generated mass spectrum is compared to a large library of mass spectra. The instrument performs identifications of bacterial, yeast and fungal pathogens within minutes of sample preparation, as opposed to a day, or in the case of fungal elements, many days.

All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by The Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO23, Minneapolis Minnesota.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. 

Any company that feels they have items that meet the needs of the Government must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim. The information must explain the company's ability to overcome propriety information and compatibility with existing instrumentation.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

All questions should be addressed to Tim Connors via email at timothy.connors@va.gov .

However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM) website. The SAM website can be accessed https://www.sam.gov.

<p>Description: <br />The Ottawa National Forest is soliciting to secure services to perform professional scientific inventory for a selected group of reptiles and amphibians on the Ottawa National Forest. This two field season contract will be the final field work of a multi-year concentrated effort to inventory and gather baseline data and document species present that may be indicators of climate change and other environmental factors within the Lake Superior basin. Data collected will be used in future management decisions on the Ottawa National Forest.<br />Synopsis: <br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for Quote (RFQ) and the documents incorporate provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65.</p>
<p>This is a total small-business set-aside. The NAICS code is 541990 and the Small Business Size Standard is $14M.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award one contract for the items listed below to the contractor who provides the best overall value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award all, part or none of the contract.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer) unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in Systems for Award Management prior to receiving a government contract (formerly Central Contractors Registration or CCR). See www.sam.gov for details - this may take up to 2 weeks and requires a DUNS number, so it is highly recommended that interested parties register immediately in order to avoid any delays in award.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

Reasonableness will be determined by considering other offered prices received and comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate. If multiple contract line items are included in the price schedule, prices will also be evaluated to determine whether any line items are unbalanced. Prices for options will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness of the proposed price using price analysis techniques and whether the options are unbalanced when compared with the base price. In addition, offerors are cautioned that the agency may reject a proposal if the price is unreasonably low, as such a price may be an indicator of a lack of understanding of the project requirements or of an increased risk of performance. b.  Notice: Refer to FAR Clause 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, as prescribed in FAR 17. Offerors are required to submit, as a minimum, an offer that conforms to the solicitation documents with pricing for Base line item and all option line items.

<DESC>Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard (PHNSY) & IMFs RD&D SL48 Shaft Lathe NID 311-047348 located in Bldg 67(X31) is an essential machine used for milling of submarine/ship propeller shafts.  This machine is over twenty years old.  This machine has two carriages however only Carriage One is presently fully operational.  A malfunction of the Z-Axis servo controller for Carriage Two caused this carriage to be inoperative.  PHNSY & IMF repaired the Z-Axis servo controller however the controller needs to be tuned to the machines specific parameters to operate properly.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RFP 226264 <br />One C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />February 12, 2013 (reposted from Nov 2012)</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (CSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered CSAPRs and the new CSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the transportable CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed at PNNL in Richland, WA.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to both the contracting officer and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>QUOTES SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify at least two (2) but no more than three (3) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>(a) Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact with telephone numbers)<br />(b) Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />(c) Type of service performed and whether Prime or subcontractor<br />(d) Required completion date for the contract<br />(e) Date the services were actually completed<br />(f) Ship Name, Hull Number <br />(g) Contract type (FFP, IDIQ, Requirement, Cost Type)<br />(h) Percentage of growth in contract price (Additional work divided by award price)</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a) (2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br /><br />Quality of Product or Service <br />Did the customer get what was specified? <br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality? <br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected? <br />Schedule <br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?) <br />Business Relations <br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction? <br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)? <br />Management of Key Personnel <br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. A quoter without a record of past performance will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.<br /><br />****Past Performance is more important than Price****</p>
<p>Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers.</p>
<p>(End of FAR 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(4) FAR 52.215-20 REQUIREMENTS FOR COST OR PRICING DATA OR INFORMATION OTHER THAN COST OR PRICING DATA (OCT 2010) ALT IV <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required <br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination.</p>
<p>The information may be as follows:</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below: <br />Trade (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.) <br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category <br />Man hours per trade, per labor grade <br />Cost/hour/trade <br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each) <br />Sub-total <br />Pension Plans <br />Overhead at a rate of ______% <br />Profit at a rate of ________% <br />Total for item _____________</p>
<p>(5) FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>

<p><br />(4)[_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to kristina.a.maratita@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 08:00 AM Pacific Time on 22 February 2013.</p>

GENERAL INFORMATION - PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
1.	General Intention:  The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain Integrated Pest Management Services for the Veterans Affairs, Black Hills Health Care System located at Hot Springs, Fort Meade, and Rapid City, South Dakota, hereinafter referred to as VA. 
2.	General Requirements:  Contractor shall adhere to local VA policy FAC-10. The VA is committed to an Integrated Pest Management Program (IPM). IPM is a process for achieving long term, environmentally sound pest suppression through the use of a wide variety of technological and management practices. The Contractor shall use control strategies that extend beyond the application of pesticides to include structural and procedural modifications that reduce the food, water, harborage, and access used by pests. This shall be achieved through detailed scheduled inspections that result in recommendations for a treatment plan that shall be written and presented for approval by the VA COTR. The Contractor shall provide all supplies, materials, equipment, labor, supervision, management and transportation to perform all tasks. 
3.	Contractor Compliance:  Contractor shall assume full responsibility for compliance with the Green Environment Management Systems (GEMS); Federal Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations; and VHA Handbook 1850.02 dated 4/14/2009, as they apply to IPM. Contractor shall also perform all work in accordance with the guidelines establish by Federal, State and local ordinances and as shown in the National Pest Control Association's Good Practice.
4.	Building Inspections:  Contractor shall provide a detailed written pest control plan to inspect all areas of the VA facilities for pest infestation and pest prevention measures. At a minimum all food service areas shall be inspected monthly, operating rooms (OR), and supply processing and distribution (SPD) areas shall be inspected quarterly, all patient treatment areas semi-annually, and all other areas annually. Any problems identified in between inspections shall be handled immediately.
During these inspections the Contractor shall;
a.	Determine which IPM measures are appropriate and required.
b.	Recommend environmental sanitation practices that restrict or eliminate food, water, or harborage for pests.
c.	Utilize basic methods (caulking, sealing cracks, etc.) for exclusion of pests. In addition, the Contractor shall make recommendations that may require action by the VA to achieve adequate pest management.
d.	Select and utilize non-chemical control methods that eliminate, exclude or repel pests, i.e., insect electrocution devices, traps, caulking, air screens, etc.
e.	Select and use the most environmentally sound pesticide(s) to effect control when chemical control methods are necessary.
f.	Determine and implement a course of action if the facilities have issues with cockroaches, ants, carpet beetles, spiders, carpenter ants, carpenter bees, bees, wasps, houseflies, stable flies, blowflies, lice, bedbugs, fleas, scabies, mites, ticks, mosquitoes, scorpions, chiggers, saw tooth grain beetles, red/confused flour beetles, grain moths, house mice, field mice, mice, roof rats, Norway rats, bats, squirrels, gophers moles, skunks, snakes, rabbits, raccoons, pigeons, starlings, sparrows, magpies, and any wood destroying organisms.
g.	Identify, remove and clean any droppings that are known to be a health concern in ceilings, barns, or any other public areas.
h.	Continue to monitor treated areas to insure control measures were adequate.
i.	A detailed account shall be provided each month where any treatment was provided, how much chemical was applied, any traps that were placed and exact locations, and the pest(s) targeted. This information may vary from time to time based on the requirements set by the Federal Guidelines.
5.	Scheduled Work:  Pest management task shall be coordinated with the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to be achieved on an agreed upon time schedule. Understanding that many times the most efficient times to inspect and develop a treatment plan are during slower periods, often after hours. However, whenever possible scheduled work should be performed during normal business hours which are Monday through Friday, 7:30 am until 4:30 pm., excluding holidays.
Contractor shall coordinate treatment applications where personnel will be present in advance so that individuals with special health needs can be reasonably accommodated. Whenever pesticides are used in a large scale application, the Safety Office shall be notified in advance also.
In the event weather conditions become unsuitable for planned work or may induce an environmental hazard, the entire work process shall be stopped and evaluated for continuation.

3.	A counseling session or initial assessment shall last a minimum of 45 minutes and will be deemed a single visit.  Longer visits will be deemed as single visits regardless of length.  A maximum of three assessment visits will be authorized initially by the Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Center referrer.  A maximum of up to fifteen visits can be authorized for additional treatment after the initial assessment has been completed.

4.	Group counseling, for reimbursement purposes, shall be 90 minutes in length.  Participation in a group counseling session constitutes one visit regardless of length beyond 90 minutes.

5.	Readjustment counseling, for the purpose of this contract, is counseling provided by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, or other counselors, individually or in groups specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral problems that bear a distinct relationship to the process of readjustment from military duty to civilian life.

An individual with other than honorable discharge may also be eligible for readjustment counseling as determined by the Vet Center.

8.	Service initiation under this contract will be through referral only.  Only Vet Center Staff (Team Leader), Regional Managers, and Chief of staff or designee at the DVA may make referrals to a contractor.  The number, type and frequency of counseling services to the veterans and significant others (i.e., members of the veteran's immediate family, legal guardian, or individual with whom the veteran lives or certifies an intention to live) can be provided only as authorized by the referring DVA and Vet center staff members.  Significant others could be seen conjointly with veteran in couple or family counseling by contract provider.

9.	Services to significant others under this contract will be initiated only on the basis of authorization from Vet Center staff or Medical Center mental health professional staff, (psychiatrists, psychologist, social worker, or a psychiatric nurse clinical specialist) at the DVA.  All referrals made by DVA Mental health professionals who are not Vet Center Staff, will be closely coordinated with the Vet Center Team Leader/Contracting Officers' Technical Representative (COR), as the latter will assume responsibility for monitoring the case once the referral is made.  Upon determination of eligibility and completion of assessment that determines the need for readjustment counseling services, a referral will be made by completion of VA Form 10-5565b, Veterans Outreach Program Contract Services Authorization.  The completion and disposition of VA Form 10-5565b is to be implemented according to the instructions on the form.

c.	Post-traumatic stress disorder
d.	Stresses unique to military duty during conflicts.
e.	Psychological concern over a possible service connected condition

k.	Psychosocial problems about type of military discharge other than dishonorable.
l.	Financial difficulties created by the loss of income as a result of active duty service.
m.	Difficulties created by the reversal of roles within the marriage as a result of the active duty service of one or both member of the marital couple.

11.	Contractor shall schedule the initial veteran's counseling session within five (5) working days from the time he/she receive the authorization (VA Form 10-5565b).

12.	Contractor will maintain counseling records that comply with the Privacy Act and will be accurate and complete.  Format for counseling record will be provided.  Contractor will ensure the physical security of records and prevention of disclosure of the records, reports, or other private information of clients except with the clients' informed written consent.  Counseling records shall mirror Vet Center charts and are considered the property of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.    One year following the termination of the contract, the contractor shall turn the client folder over to the authorizing Vet Center.

13.	Contractor shall provide in writing an initial comprehensive psychosocial assessment to the COR no later than the completion of three (3) initial visits.  An updated counseling plan will be submitted to the COR one (1) week prior to completion of each authorized block of visits thereafter which addresses continuing need for readjustment counseling.

14.	Determination of adequacy of counseling plans will be based on the professional judgment of the DVA referrer in each case.  At the completion of each counseling session or group, the contractor will document on the appropriate form the name of veteran or client, as well as length, date, and specific type of counseling session.  This verification form will be filled in by the contractor and presented to the veteran or client for his/her signature.  A separate verification form is to be completed for each veteran for each month, and attached to the monthly bill submitted to the Vet Center.

15.	Contractors will be required to have veteran sign required verification form for each session of readjustment counseling and will attach to invoices when submitted for payment.  At the time services are rendered, the contractor will secure a signed acknowledgment of services from each client and for each visit for which they are billing the Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Center (DVA).  Contractor shall list the names of the clients, and also indicate the type of counseling provided.

16.	While the provision for medications and physical examinations are not considered a component of readjustment counseling services, and will not be provided under this contract mechanism, offerors must have the capability to arrange for, through referral, physical assessments and medical treatment and therapy or to provide such services directly.

17.	Contractor shall advise all veterans where applicable that the DVA will not reimburse them through this program for physical examinations, drugs, or other medical treatments.  DVA will provide medical care where appropriate to eligible veterans within the limits of this Medical Center.

18.	As it is impossible to determine the exact number of counseling sessions that will be required during the contract term, each provider whose proposal is accepted wholly or in part will be required to deliver all articles or services that may be ordered during the contract term, except as he/she otherwise indicates in his/her proposal and except as otherwise provided herein.

19.	Proposals offering less than 85% of the estimated number of needed counseling sessions or which provide that the Government shall guarantee any specific number of counseling sessions, will not be considered.  The fact that the number of counseling sessions are estimated shall not relieve the contractor from providing all services placed under this contract.  There will be absolutely no formal or informal guarantee of quantities provided in or throughout the duration of the contract, by any individual.

20.	Contracts will only be entered into by the DVA that are based on a rate schedule (amount charged by provider for each client visit) which falls within the range of usual and customary fees for the specific geographical area in which services are provided.  In determining the appropriate fee range, it should be noted that different usual and customary fees prevail for different types of therapy; i.e., individual, group, family, and professional discipline.

21.	A site visit shall be made to the contractor's facility prior to award by a DVA team.  After award, Team Leader will be authorized on-site inspection of contract provider facilities on an annual basis or as needed to respond to any clinical concerns or problems that develop during the term of the contract.

22.	A post-award orientation shall be held with all involved parties at the DVA to respond to any questions and provide clarification as necessary.

23.	In accordance with DVA requirements, the Contracting Officer shall provide a Contracting Officers' Technical Representative (COR) and an alternate COR for technical supervision of the contract.  The contractor will be provided a copy of the Delegation of Authority.

24.	The DVA may make changes to forms, time frames, number of visits, etc., as directed by VA Regional or Central Offices.  Should this occur, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer and COR at the time the information is received.

25.	Contractors' facility shall be adequate to meet the criteria for providing services to the veterans; physical floor plan to include private/confidential group and individual counseling areas.  Contractors' counseling areas shall be easily accessible to the physically challenged.

26.	Contractor shall insure that all client appointment books, charts, and client related information are locked in a secure location.

27.	Contractor is required to report and submit for approval, any proposed changes in personnel providing services under this contract to the Contracting Officer through the COR.  All providers under the contract will be listed along with their reimbursement rates for each type of service.

28.	Contractor shall insure that the initial counseling session is scheduled within five (5) working days from the date the contractor receives the VA Form 10-5565b authorizing visits.

29.	Contractor will be required to submit initial assessments/counseling, updated counseling plans, and Veterans DD214, to the COR one (1) week prior to scheduling the next block of visits.  Contractor will insure that all client records are maintained in a structured format and contain assessment/counseling plans.

30.	Contractor will be required to insure all client progress notes are present, dated, signed and show client movement in relation to counseling goals.

31.	Contractor shall insure that any clients who cannot be counseled by the contractor are referred appropriately.  Contractor shall document in client file and consult with COR any client with complicated medical and/or psychiatric problems.

32.	Contractor will insure that all clients presenting homicidal and or suicidal potential are reviewed with the COR immediately and documented in the client's file.  A copy of the written report shall be given to the COR within 48 hours.

33.	Contractor shall insure that follow-up contacts are made within 60 days after the last contact with client and is documented in client folder.

35.	Contractor shall insure that client folders are placed in inactive status after 90 days of inactivity unless there are clinical reasons to keep the file active.

36.	A closing summary shall be placed in inactive client folders, which spells out the degree of success (or lack thereof), counseling plan/goals and prognosis. A copy of the closing summary report shall be given to the COR within 30 calendar days.

37.	The group counseling shall be effectively utilized, approximating a 30/70 group to individual ratio or better where feasible and appropriate.

38.	This contract will be effective from the date of award through September 30, 2013 with two (2), one-year option periods. The contractor shall provide counseling services in a manner consistent with the time frame of the contract.  The length of time in which counseling services are provided to individual veterans under this contract will be as authorized by the Modesto Vet Center.

Submit questions to 101ARW.MSC@ang.af.mil.  <br>  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The work requires multi-discipline professional A-E services for various projects throughout the State of Maine (Maine Air National Guard/Maine Army National Guard).  The selection of a firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather the process for A-E firm selection described in FAR 36 using the competitive ranking of firms based upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  The competitive ranking will be followed by a negotiation with the most highly ranked firm and continuing to lower ranked firms only if satisfactory terms are not reached with the preferred firm as described in FAR 36.606.  The A-E firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.  All firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of interest; and FAR 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer firms.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

____________________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, 4 weeks after 15 years, and 5 weeks after 25 years.
  Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present
contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in
the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin
Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and
Christmas Day.  A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another
day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)
(See 29 CFR 4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.



All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the Joint Program Executive Office - Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Program Manager - Guardian Product Manager - Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) has a need for Increment 3 of an Automated Installation Entry (AIE) System.   The objective of this acquisition is to provide Automated Installation Entry (AIE) hardware and software for up to 35 new installations.  AIE provides timely, effective and efficient threat detection necessary for Installation Commanders to assess and react in all threat environments.  AIE automates access control processes for authorized and registered personnel entering an installation.  AIE improves accuracy of access/denial and enables near real-time changes of authentication requirements in response to changes in force protection conditions.  The AIE acquisition will enhance installation security and improve both pedestrian and vehicle throughput at Access Control Points (ACP).  The third generation AIE System (AIE-3) will build on AIE-2 capabilities while meeting U.S. Army AIE Standards and Specifications dated 19 November 2007.  Additional capabilities will include biometric integration, extended sensor suites, enhanced automated processes and integration with the Joint Service architecture.  AIE-3 will be DIACAP accredited, net-ready and interoperable with legacy AIE systems and related base defense, force protection and physical security systems.  AIE-1 and AIE-2 installations may be retrofitted within the scope of this contract.  <br>    <br>  A Product Demonstration will be required for interested vendors. Information regarding Product Demonstration Procedures and Product Demonstration Evaluation Criteria will be released in the RFP. Vendors will be required to self nominate for participation in the Product Demonstration within two weeks of solicitation release in accordance with the RFP. The AIE-3 contract will be awarded using full and open competition with small business subcontracting requirements.  The Government will award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a ceiling of $99M.  The POP will be four years (a two-year base and two one-year options).  <br>    <br>  A single Delivery Order (DO) will be awarded for each installation that includes site survey, site design, hardware and software acquisition and integration, fielding and CLS.  The DO will ensure the AIE-3 systems fielded across all installations are based on one integrated, Government-approved system configuration.    <br>   <br> The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.

<DESC>This requirement is based on a rapidly deployed pre-engineered modular substation using readily available pad-mount components including a fixed tap transformer and separate single phase regulators.  It is anticipated that such a design will result in lower costs and shorter lead times.    <br>    <br>  OBJECTIVES  <br>    <br>  The overall objective of this RFI is to improve the government's understanding of industry capabilities and identify qualified sources capable of providing these critical services in support of the purchase and installation of the electrical substation.  Fort Riley reserves the right to utilize information from the responses to this RFI to determine if any business may be applicable to any resultant solicitation.  Responding to this RFI does not automatically qualify the responder to be included on any list, if such a list is developed.  Vendors wishing to submit a response to any subsequent solicitation must monitor FedBizOpps for the synopsis.    <br>    <br>  This Request for Information is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government.  This is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.   <br>    <br>  CAPABILITIES COVERAGE-  <br>    <br>  Fort Riley seeks to identify vendors that can provide the following required work.  This project is to provide and install a complete and usable above ground outdoor substation, including connecting the substation to existing primary and secondary electrical distribution lines and commissioning of the completed system. The Contractor shall furnish all surveys, engineering, design, labor, equipment, materials, and transportation to perform all required work in accordance with this document:  <br>  SPECIFICATIONS:   <br>    <br>  The new substation capacity shall be at least 5,000 KVA.  <br>    <br>  The primary side of the substation shall be fed from the existing 34.5kV distribution line, located immediately northeast of the site.  <br>  The secondary side of the substation shall feed two circuits to the existing 12.47kV distribution line, also located immediately northeast of the site (under built to the 34.5kV).  The 12.47kV line shall be cut and two risers shall be installed so that one circuit will feed to the north, and the second circuit will feed to the south.  <br>  This requirement is based on a rapidly deployed pre-engineered modular substation using readily available pad-mount components including a fixed tap transformer and separate single phase regulators.  It is anticipated that such a design will result in lower costs and shorter lead times.    <br>  MODULAR SUBSTATION  <br>  Substation Type:  Distribution substation with numerous residential and commercial loads on two 12.47kV feeders serving up to 2,600kVA each   <br>  Substation shall be completely assembled, installed and tested.  <br>  Substation may be completely assembled in the factory and pre-tested prior to shipping and made ready for connection to incoming 34.5kV underground transmission, and outgoing 12.47 kV underground feeder conductors.  <br>  The substation and all components may be pre-assembled on galvanized steel skids, designed for installation on site-prepared concrete pier foundations; or, it may be assembled and installed on site on poured in place concrete pads.  <br>  Substation shall include power transformer, regulators, and secondary switchgear with vacuum circuit breakers, reclosing relays, current and voltage transformers, and all associated instrumentation and wiring.  Also provide galvanized steel supports, weatherproof enclosures, control building, mounting skids, anchor bolts, and any other equipment necessary for a complete and usable substation.  <br>  PRIMARY CONNECTIONS:  <br>  Recommended point of connection is the existing 34.5kV primary overhead line at pole E1645, located immediately to the east of Building 2620.  The existing 34.5kV line is three 477MCM ACSR overhead cables in a delta arrangement.  <br>  Pole E1645 shall be replaced with a new pole that is structurally able to support the new tie-in equipment.  <br>  The new pole E1645 shall include an overhead radial tap to the existing 34.5kV primary line and a new Gang Operated Air Break (GOAB) switch, lightning arrestors, hook stick fuses, shield wire terminations, and riser to transition to underground feed to the new substation.   <br>  Underground Distribution:  <br>  New underground cable shall be 35KV, MV-105, copper conductor, EPR insulated cable with tape shield.  <br>  Underground cables shall be installed in rigid steel conduit, or PVC conduit encased in concrete.  <br>  Above grade risers shall be installed in rigid steel conduit.  Transitions from rigid steel to PVC, if used, shall be made below grade.  <br>    <br>  Power Transformer:  <br>  Type:  Outdoor, Pad-Mounted, Deadfront   <br>  Capacity:  At least 5,000KVA at 55 C rise, no fans  <br>  (OPTION 1:  7,500KVA at 55 C rise, see section Error! Reference source not found.)  <br>  Number of Phases:  3  <br>  Primary Voltage:  34.5kV  <br>  Primary Connection:  Delta  <br>  Secondary Voltage:  12.47kV   <br>  Secondary Connection:  Grounded Wye  <br>  Frequency: 60 Hz  <br>  Taps:  None  <br>    <br>  Voltage Regulators:  <br>  Type:  Self Contained, Outdoor, Pad-Mounted, Dead Front, Single-Phase, Fluid-Immersed, Step-Type  <br>  Capacity:  At least 167KVA per phase, 500KVA total (10% regulation)  <br>  Quantity:  3  <br>  Voltage:  7.2kV nominal  <br>  Frequency:  60Hz  <br>  Regulation:  +/- 10% in 32 steps of 5/8%  <br>  Secondary Switchgear:  <br>  Type:  Outdoor, Fully Enclosed, Pad-Mounted, Three-Phase.    <br>  Number of Circuits:  One Main and Two Feeders  <br>  Interrupting Medium:  Vacuum  <br>  Continuous Current Rating:  600A  <br>  Interrupt Rating:  12kA  <br>  Protection Relays:    <br>  1.	Type:  Microprocessor based  <br>  2.	Protection shall include:  <br>  a.	Instantaneous/Time Phase Overcurrent (50/51)  <br>  b.	Instantaneous/Time Neutral Overcurrent (50/51N)   <br>  c.	Recloser (79), required on feeders only  <br>  d.	Under/Over voltage (27/59)   <br>  3.	Relays shall be fully configurable from the local display and keypad, without the need for a computer interface.  <br>  Main and feeder circuits shall be metered for voltage (V), current (A), demand (KW) and accumulated energy (KWH).   <br>    <br>  Remote Communications/Monitoring:  Meters and Relays shall include integral Modbus communications.  Communication cable shall be installed to connect all devices together to provide a single  quote mark point of connection quote mark .  This Modbus access point will not be connected to the post network at this time, but will facilitate a future connection to the network and the post Energy Management Control System.  <br>  SECONDARY CONNECTIONS:  <br>  Recommended point of connection is the existing 12.47kV overhead line at pole E1644, located approximately 200' to the southeast of Building 2620, and immediately northeast of the site.  The existing 12.47KV line is four #4 CU overhead cables in a grounded Wye arrangement.  <br>  Pole E1644 shall be replaced with a new pole that is structurally able to support the new tie-in equipment.  <br>  The existing 12.47 line shall be cut at pole E1644 and a new horizontal Gang Operated Air Break (GOAB) switch installed to allow the two sections to be tied together.  On each side of the tie switch, install overhead radial taps to two new hookstick operated switches, shield wire terminations, and riser to transition to underground feed from the new substation.  (Note:  Alternative proposals for the switching arrangement on this pole, including the use of vertical GOAB switches in lieu of the hookstick operated switches, or running the risers up two separate poles, will be considered.)  <br>  After completion, the standard configuration will be for the tie switch to be open and both riser switches to be closed.  In addition, at pole E1705A west of ESS05, the existing tie switch will be closed and the riser switches opened.  Thus, one of the new substation feeders will feed northwest from pole E1644, effectively taking on the load of existing ESS05 circuit 2 (i.e., circuit 52).  The other new substation feeder will feed southeast from pole E1644, effectively taking on the load of existing ESS05 circuit 1 (i.e., circuit 51).  <br>  SITE PREPARATION:  <br>  Project site will be brought up to desired elevation by the Government.  All site trenching, backfilling, compaction, gravel hauling and installation, and concrete work shall be provided by the Contractor.    <br>  Foundations: The Contractor shall design and install all foundations and provide hardware necessary to attach equipment skids, structures, electrical equipment, control building, etc. to their respective foundations  <br>  Underground conduits & ducts: The contractor shall provide all trenching, earth work. Backfilling, compaction, and grading required according to the contractor provided site plan.  <br>  Contractor shall design and install all components necessary to properly ground the substation and devices.  <br>  CAPABILITY STATEMENT   <br>  Interested parties are requested to submit a capability statement that addresses the following:   <br>    <br>  1.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>*The purpose of this modification to the RFI is to extend the deadline for&nbsp;industry&nbsp;comments/questions&nbsp;from the close of business (COB) February 19, 2013, to the&nbsp;COB February 25, 2013.&nbsp; Additionally, the&nbsp;deadline is extended&nbsp;to post responses to </strong><a href="http://www.FBO.gov"><strong>www.FBO.gov</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for the submitted&nbsp;industry comments/questions&nbsp;from March 14, 2013, to March 21, 2013. All other instructions and information contained herein remains unchanged.*</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance FAR 15.201(e) and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice. No funds are available to pay for preparation or responses to this RFI and no entitlement or payment of direct and/or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of a vendor's submission of a response to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. This RFI is for planning purposes only and any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government wants to secure information regarding the capabilities of industry to meet Agency requirements as stated herein. <br /><br />The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is a United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) agency, with its headquarters at Fort Lee, VA. DeCA operates a worldwide chain of commissaries providing groceries to military personnel, retirees, and their families. DeCA currently operates 248 military commissaries worldwide with annual sales estimated at $6 billion. Of that total, 178 stores are located within the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii, and 70 stores are located in 12 countries outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>A military commissary is a Government facility providing grocery products, services, and other merchandise to authorized individuals, termed "patrons." It is a facility designed and operated similar to commercial supermarkets. DeCA's goals are to provide the military community with a great shopping experience; sustain a capable, diverse, and engaged civilian workforce; and be a model organization through agility and governance.</p>
<p>DeCA is in the process of updating the performance work statement (PWS) language for the delicatessen and bakery operations to ensure the requirement performance and goals align with the continued success of DeCA's mission, vision, and goals. DeCA's objective is to utilize industry expertise and best practices and seeks industry comments for the revised PWS language attached hereto.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DeCA requests industry comments on the following language and the feasibility of the pricing elements of the requirement criteria. <br /><br />DeCA is seeking a percentage of savings for each of the five product categories listed below. The amount expressed as a percentage of savings is what the offeror proposes to save the commissary patron on each item for the respective product category when evaluated against same or similar items from comparable commercial supermarket operations in a twenty (20) mile local commuting survey area of each commissary location. Offerors shall propose no less than a twenty (20) percent of savings, for each product category, for each CLIN, and corresponding sub-CLINs, as set forth in a potentially solicited SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES. Pricing offered on a sub-CLIN shall be applicable to all locations covered by the CLIN.</p>
<p>Additionally, pricing of the one or more clusters of sub-CLINs offered from the potentially solicited SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES shall include labor, materials, overhead, and profit costs for the work effort required to operate and manage the contracted operations at the locations set forth in the schedule.</p>
<p>**NOTE** The following categories are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>Product Categories:<br />a. Random Weight: Bulk meats, cheeses and other items which are sold by weight and which require additional preparation and or packaging prior to being purchased by the patron. Examples include sliced deli meat, cold salads, salad bar, olives, etc.</p>
<p>b. Bakery: Includes breads, cakes, muffins, pies and other items which are either pre-packaged for immediate sale, or require some preparation from contractor personnel. Specialty items such as wedding cakes, sheet cakes, designer cupcakes, etc. are included in this category.</p>
<p>c. Ready to heat/ready to eat: Items which are prepared by vendor for immediate consumption by the patron, or which have already been cooked and can be reheated for use by patrons. Examples include rotisserie chicken, side dishes, meal solutions, sandwiches, soups, etc.</p>
<p>d. Sushi: Items which are primarily made up of cold rice dressed with vinegar, formed into any of various shapes, and garnished especially with bits of raw seafood or vegetables. Typically these items will be prepared in store, by trained personnel.</p>
<p>e. Non Random Weight: Items which arrive at the store pre-packaged by manufacturer require no additional preparation, for immediate purchase by patrons. These items usually have a manufacturer provided UPC code. Examples include imported, local and ethnic grocery like items.</p>
<p>Responses are limited to twenty-five (25) single-sided pages, Times Roman, size twelve (12)&nbsp;font, and one inch margins.</p>
<p>Contact with the individual DeCA stores is prohibited. In the event that a vendor has any specific questions regarding this initiative, they are asked to refer those questions, in writing, by the cut-off date, to the email address shown below.</p>
<p>The deadline for the receipt of questions and/or comments is the close of business (COB),&nbsp;February 25, 2013*. Written queries will be answered by the appropriate subject matter expert. Responses to all questions submitted will be consolidated and posted to www.fbo.gov, no later March 21, 2013*. Refer all questions and/or comments via email to Mr. David Leffert, Commissary Management Specialist, Defense Commissary Agency, <a href="mailto:david.leffert@deca.mil">david.leffert@deca.mil</a>.</p>

<p><br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Kearney, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 6860 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 6465 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to a maximum of 6530 ANSI/BOMA OASF. The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 10/31/2013.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 40 on site hard surface parking spaces, including 7 official Government vehicles<br />&bull; Specific Information Technology requirements</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.<br />&bull; List of building services provided.</p>

<ARCHDATE>02122013
<CONTACT>Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum  202-781-2629 Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil

<DESC>Synopsis:
The Naval Sea Systems Command is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of SEA 05 (Naval Systems Engineering Directorate) and PMS 320 (the Electric Ships Office) seeking information from electrical equipment manufacturers and system integrators for information to support the development of electrical interface specifications for DC power distribution.  The Navy desires industry recommendations for establishing this new interface standard.

Description:
MIL-STD-1399-300B, Interface Standard, Electric Power, Alternating Current was issued on 24 April 2008.  This standard has proven effective in enabling the successful integration of shipboard power system with load equipment.
   An analogous interface standard for DC systems does not exist for voltages between 600 and 20000 VDC.  Equipment and systems with a variety of nominal voltages in this range have been developed over the past 15 years.  To promote commonality and reduce total ownership costs, the Navy is interested in establishing a new section of MIL-STD-1399 for electrical power, direct current.   Of particular interest are recommendations and their rationale for nominal voltages between 600 VDC and 1000 VDC and between 5000 VDC and 20000 VDC, for power quality requirements (analogous to those in MIL-STD-1399-300B and 680 for AC power), for user equipment interface requirements, and for user equipment interface tests.
   These standard interfaces would be invoked in future modifications to specifications such as MIL-PRF-32272 and MIL-PRF-32168.  

Responses:
Responses and comments are requested by 4:00 pm (EST), on April 15, 2013.  However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEAs strategic planning.  Information should be e-mailed to Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil or mailed to Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Joseph Tannenbaum, PMS 320, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376 and labeled with the solicitation number and Electrical interface Specifications for DC Power Distribution RFI.  Questions can be submitted electronically to norbert.doerry@navy.mil or by phone at (202) 781-2520.
 

Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed.  Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies and should not contain proprietary information.  However, if some of the background on the comments provided is considered proprietary to the respondent, that portion shall be segregated and labeled as such and will be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.
  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.
  Follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection or preference.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any is issued.  Classified material will not be accepted.

<DESC>DHS has a requirement on a sole source basis to extend a bridge contract vehicle for up to 4 months (4) for critical research and development (R&amp;D) support services, specifically trace explosives and explosives simulant laboratory operations and associated technical support. The proposed period of performance for this action is February 16, 2013 through April 15, 2013 with two (2) one month options.
<p>The current contract HSHQDC-12-C-000030 was awarded on May 13, 2012 for a period of 6 months as a sole source award under DHS J&amp;A No. 072-12 on an interim measure until such time as the award of a follow-on contract vehicle can be made through full and open competition. Since the expiration of this period of performance, the contract was extended IAW FAR Clause 52.217-8 (Option to Extend Services) beginning on November 6, 2012 through February 15, 2013 and was processed under DHS J&amp;A No. 001-13 and approved by the OPO Competition Advocate.</p>
<p>On November 23, 2012, OPO issued Request for Quotation HSHQDC-12-Q-00319 under GSA e-Buy. The Solicitation closed on January 14, 2013 and multiple proposals were received. RFQ HSHQDC-12-Q-00319 includes the services that are presently covered under the interim bridge contract. The estimated milestone timeline for the award of new contract vehicles under the RFQ exceeds the period of performance available on the current GST contract and it is critical that TSL continue to maintain contract coverage while the RFQ proposal evaluations are underway. The estimated award timeline is April, 2013. For this proposed action, J&amp;A No. 048-13 has been coordinated and approved by the OPO Competition Advocate.</p>
<p>The approved J&amp;A is attached.</p>

<DESC>DHS/TSL has a requirement on a limited source basis to extend the interim bridge contract vehicle HSHQDC-12-F-00065 for up to four (4) months of certification readiness testing and support services for the evaluation of systems. The proposed period of performance for this action is February 16, 2013 through April 15, 2013 with two (2) one month options. <br /><br />The current Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-00065 was awarded on July 16, 2012 for a period of 5 months as a sole source award under DHS LSJ No. 102-12 on an interim measure until such time as the award of a follow-on contract vehicle can be made through full and open competition. Since the expiration of this period of performance, the contract was extended IAW FAR Clause 52.217-8 (Option to Extend Services) beginning on December 16, 2012 through February 15, 2013 and was processed under DHS LSJ No. 019-13 and approved by the OPO Competition Advocate.
<p>The purpose of LSJs 102-12 and 019-13 was to provide TSL with continued contract coverage while a newly competitive contract vehicle could be solicited. On November 23, 2012, OPO issued Request for Quotation HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 under GSA e-Buy. The Solicitation closed on December 21, 2013 and a total of four (4) proposals were received. RFQ HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 includes the research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) services that are presently covered under the interim bridge task order. The estimated milestone timeline for the award of new contract vehicles under the RFQ exceeds the period of performance available on the current task order and it is critical that TSL continue to maintain contract coverage while the RFQ proposal evaluations are underway. The estimated award timeline is March, 2013. For this proposed action, LSJ No. 049-13 has been coordinated and approved by the OPO Competition Advocate.</p>
<p>For this proposed extension, Other Direct Material Costs (ODC) will be required in order to perform the services. In accordance with the requirements of FAR 8.402(f) and competition requirements of FAR Part 6, an open market J&amp;A document has been prepared to cover the ODC portion of this action.</p>
<p>The approved LSJ No. 049-13 and J&amp;A No. 050-13 are attached.</p>

The Coast Guard intends to conduct this procurement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.<br /><br /><strong>As a result of the change of location of work performance from possibly three locations to one location and the change in vendor interest, this requirement is now being conducted as a small business set aside.</strong> <strong>The location of work performance will be the Industrial Support Facility, Portsmouth, VA pier.<br /><br /></strong>The NAICS code will be 336611 and the small business size standard will be less than 1000 employees.
<p>The solicitation will be issued as a best value request for proposal (RFP) approximately <strong>12 February 2013</strong> with proposals due approximately&nbsp;<strong>12 March 2013.</strong> Proposals will be evaluated using price and past performance as evaluation factors with past performance being considered more important than price. The solicitation/RFP will be issued via the Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov/. A hard copy solicitation will not be issued. Contractors will need to monitor the FedBizOpps website for RFQ/solicitation release and any subsequent amendments.</p>
<p>The performance period is anticipated to be from approximately 21 May 2013 - 3 July 2013.</p>
<p>The current tentative list of items for this requirement is listed below:</p>
<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION<br />WORK ITEM 1: Hull Fittings (Weight Handling Rigging Hardware), Inspect and Test <br />WORK ITEM 2: Spud(s), Overhaul - Tender <br />WORK ITEM 3: Spud Well(s), Inspect - Tender <br />WORK ITEM 4: Compressed Air Receivers (All), Clean, Inspect, and Hydro - Barge <br />WORK ITEM 5: Spuds, Overhaul - Barge <br />WORK ITEM 6: Spud Well Surfaces, Inspect - Barge <br />WORK ITEM 7: Mechanical Chain Stoppers , Overhaul <br />WORK ITEM 8: Deck Covering (Interior Wet/Dry), Renew <br />WORK ITEM 9: Deck Surfaces Under Crew Berthing A/C Unit, Preserve <br />WORK ITEM 10: Engine Room Miscellaneous Fuel Oil Piping, Renew <br />WORK ITEM 11: Cargo Hatch, Repair <br />WORK ITEM 12: Watertight Doors and Scuttles (External), Renew <br />WORK ITEM 13: Watertight Doors and Scuttles (External), Renew <br />WORK ITEM 14: 01 Deck Plating, Renew <br />WORK ITEM 15: Bridge Window, Repair <br />WORK ITEM 16: Buoy Deck Locker Plating, Renew <br />WORK ITEM 17: Molded Case Circuit Breakers, Inspect &amp; Test <br />WORK ITEM 18: Compressed Air Receivers (All), Clean, Inspect, and Hydro - Tender <br />WORK ITEM 19: Crane Installation<br />WORK ITEM 20: Renew Oxy/Acetylene Rack on Buoy Deck<br />WORK ITEM 21: Fire Pump Foundation Renew (Barge)<br />WORK ITEM 22: Davit Modification<br />WORK ITEM 23: Replacement Air Compressor<br />WORK ITEM 24: AFFF Modification<br />WORK ITEM 25: Crane Pedestal Installation<br />WORK ITEM 26: Service Air Modifications</p>
<p>The crane which is to be installed (Work Item 25) is expected to arrive on 24 May 2013. The contractor who wins the award should precede on all work items at the start of the contract and be prepared for the crane delivery. Although the crane is scheduled to be delivered shortly after contract award, this should not delay the contractor as there are plenty of work items to complete such as removal of old crane air lines, buoy deck hull fitting inspections, cargo hatch repair, etc....</p>

<DESC>The proposed effort consists of three tasks: creating a design methodology; generating a visualization tool based on an existing set of data; and extending the visualization tool to allow for new data.
The creation of a design methodology will be the basis for entire program.  Under this task, the current design optimization process will be transposed into a succinct methodology that can be visualized and analyzed.  The methodology will take into account that the user may have existing data or may be looking to start anew with yet to be completed computational data.
The methodology will then be codified and tested on existing data sets.  Where needed, additional computational simulations will be performed to enhance the design space.  The tool will then be extended to allow for entirely new data sets.  In this case, the tool will indicate what areas of the domain require more simulations and when the computational method needs to be enhanced to allow for more accurate solutions.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>NMS-13-006
<AWDDATE>030113
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission intents to issue a sole source purchase order under the authority of 13.106-1(b) to:
<p>Safer Systems<br />23 Coachman Way <br />Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada T8H1C5</p>
<p>The objective of this order is to obtain contract support services from Safer Systems to: (1) maintain the off-the-shelf "Safer HAZMAT Responder" software package currently installed at the agency; (2) provide software program updates and enhancements to include major upgrades and new releases; (3) train NRC staff in the use of the software program; (4) provide technical support to NRC staff and; (5) allow for the option to purchase five additional software licenses of the software with upgrades and technical support as needed by NRC staff.</p>
<p>The Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, Division of Fuel Cycle Safety and Safeguards is responsible in the event of an accident at a fuel cycle facility to respond to ensure the protection of both public health and safety and the environment. Accidents at fuel cycle facilities that pose the greatest risk are chemical releases from the materials used in processing of source and special nuclear material. To access the real and potential consequences of accidents at fuel cycle facilities, the strengths of this type of proposed software program (i.e., Safer HAZMAT Responder) will provide in real time an analysis of the effects of the chemical release that update with time and changes in the weather. There is still an Agency need for the use of the software program; to include maintaining the software; updates/upgrades/ enhancements to the software; technical support; additional training; and the option to purchase additional licenses.</p>
<p>The required software is proprietary and exclusive to Safer Systems. Further, Safer Systems has no authorized resellers of their software, and does not authorize any other firm to maintain or make adjustments to its very specialized software product.</p>
<p>It would be impractical to have another firm develop the software specifically for the NRC as the Agency would incur a cost of approximately $1,500,000 if a new source had to develop the software. This figure does not include the retraining of staff which, depending on the number of users, could run into may thousands of dollars. This would be a duplication of effort since Safer Systems Services already has the required software. If the NRC is unable to obtain the required software, staff will be unable to adequately assess the effects of a chemical release from a fuel cycle facility in real-time. This would have a significant and detrimental effect on the ability of the agency to respond to requests for assistance by the Federal, State, and Local authorities for an independent assessment of the conditions on the ground. The estimated cost if the Government were to develop the software was based on extensive technical knowledge and experience of the Project Manager in the subject field. It should be noted that chemical dispersion software contains very detailed mathematical algorisms that are beyond the skill of average programmers and it is the software industry uses instead of building its own.</p>
<p>Although a determination has been determined the award of this project is not urgent, it should be noted the current Safer Systems software the Agency currently uses will continue to operate on NRC's system as long as there are no significant changes to the Agency operating system (e.g., move to Windows 7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please submit in writing to the Contracting Officer any objections or questions in regards to this intent to sole source within 15 days from this notice.</p>

<p>This requirement is for the purchase of Light Credentialing Solution Kits through HP Enterprise Services, LLC. Light Credentialing Solution Kits are used in support of the HSPD-12 mandate.</p>
<p>The General Service Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service launched the Homeland Security Presidential Directive -12 (HSPD-12) Managed Services Office (MSO) on September 13, 2006, providing turn-key services to produce compliant PIV II credentials and assist Federal agencies in satisfying Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidance M-05-24. The MSO established the USAccess program, a managed, shared service solution that simplifies the process of procuring and maintaining PIV compliant credentials. The MSO provides the project, acquisition and financial management necessary to help participating agencies receive the USAccess end-to-end service.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.405-6(b) (1), only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialize nature of the work. HP Enterprise Services, LLC is the incumbent who has been providing support for the Light Credentialing Solution Kit since October 2009. For continuity of service it is crucial and in the best interest of the Government to continue with HP Enterprise Services, LLC. As this mandate is critical to Treasury and its bureaus, a delay in support could adversely affect the outcome and shed negative publicity on the Department of Treasury (Treasury). Such negative impact could also result in the Treasury having to report unfavorable results to the OMB. In addition, this will also make us extremely vulnerable to an audit which could delay progress even more.</p>
