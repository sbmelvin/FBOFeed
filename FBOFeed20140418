Excellent = Exceeds Standards
Satisfactory = Meets Standards
Unsatisfactory = Fails To Meet Standards
 

8. DOCUMENTING PERFORMANCE

a.  ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE

The Government shall document positive performance.  Any report may become a part of the supporting documentation for any contractual action. 

b.  UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE

When unacceptable performance occurs, the COTR shall inform the contractor.  This will normally be in writing unless circumstances necessitate verbal communication.  In any case the COTR shall document the discussion and place it in the COTR file.  

When the COTR determines formal written communication is required, the COTR shall prepare a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR), and present it to the contractor's program manager.  

The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of the CDR in writing.  The CDR will specify if the contractor is required to prepare a corrective action plan to document how the contractor shall correct the unacceptable performance and avoid a recurrence.  The CDR will also state how long after receipt the contractor has to present this corrective action plan to the COTR.  The Government shall review the contractor's corrective action plan to determine acceptability. 

Any CDRs may become a part of the supporting documentation for any contractual action deemed necessary by the CO. 


9. FREQUENCY OF MEASUREMENT

a. Frequency of Measurement.

During contract performance, the COR will periodically analyze whether the negotiated frequency of surveillance is appropriate for the work being performed.  

b. Frequency of Performance Assessment Meetings.

<DESC>This is a market survey for the acquisition of Electric and magnetic field probes.  The FAA is seeking probes meeting the following criteria:

Model Number     Item Description
2400/101B	NBM-500
2402/08B 	EB5091 FCC Shaped E-Field Probe


The FAA does not have the specifications or drawings for these units. 

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are concerned about potential health hazards to workers exposed to radiofrequency (RF) energy emitted from RF dielectric heaters (more widely known as RF sealers and heaters). RF energy is nonionizing electromagnetic radiation and should not be confused with X-rays and other ionizing radiation. RF energy, when absorbed in sufficient amounts by workers, may produce adverse thermal effects resulting from heating of deep body tissue which may include potentially damaging alterations in cells. Absorption of RF energy may also result in "nonthermal" effects on cells or tissue, which may occur without a measureable increase in tissue or body temperature. "Nonthermal" effects have been reported to occur at exposure levels lower than those that cause thermal effects. 

Workers near RF sealers may be unaware of their exposure to RF emissions, because the RF energy from sealers and heaters can penetrate deeply into the body without activating the heat sensors located in the skin. A false sense of employee safety may exist; in many instances, worker exposures to RF energy may not have been properly assessed. This has been due, largely, to the complex problems of measurement and thus the misapplication of the instruments available for monitoring RF energy levels. Recently, monitoring instruments that facilitate accurate measurement of worker exposure have been developed. Federal survey teams, equipped with these new instruments, have detected excessive exposures of workers to RF energy.

All probes must have OSHA certification.

Currently, the only known source is Narda Corporation.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals at this time.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the items requested.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

<DESC>TFDM REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

1.	INTRODUCTION
On March 19, 2014, the TFDM program presented the Business Case analysis data and successfully obtained the Initial Investment Decision (IID).  Key to this decision is the down-select to a single Alternative approach, which the Program will focus on to prepare the final business case to be presented at the Final Investment Decision (FID) JRC meeting.  Although the Program achieved a favorable IID, the TFDM program must continue to seek opportunities to increase its affordability and benefit/cost ratio. The first step in achieving this goal is performing RFI #3.

2.	 AVIATION INDUSTRY FORUM 2014
FAA is considering any and all options for structuring the SIR at this time and seeks the input from industry regarding specific risks, and benefits of acquisition strategies.

In addition to this RFI, the TFDM program office may release updates and or draft version of the Statement of Work for industry comment prior to releasing any future SIR or RFP.  Any and all future releases will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities website (FAACO) https://faaco.faa.gov/) and the FAA-TFDM program web site. http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/pmo/proj/tfdm/

TFDM program information, general scope, high level service and system requirements, and initial plans will be presented to industry as part of the FAA Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Program Management Organization (PMO) Industry Forum on April 23 and 24, 2014. The TFDM information presented during this 2-day forum event will be available from the TFDM program office web site.

3.	 FAACO ANNOUNCEMENT
This Request for Information (RFI) #3 announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy at 3.2.1.2.1. 

This RFI will be used by the FAA for information gathering purposes only. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP). The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. Any cost associated with the preparation and submittal of such information, in written format only, is solely at each vendors expense. 

The FAA is anticipating releasing a Full & Open Competition, with a mixture of pricing CLINS, and a period of performance of approximately twelve (12) years. The period of performance is anticipated to be a (5) year base and (7) one year options.

4.	PURPOSE:
The TFDM Program Office is now soliciting input from industry through RFI #3 for assistance in identifying applicable best practices, review and comment of the acquisition statement of work and documentation and information concerning specific questions the FAA has on select aspects of the program. The information provided in this RFI #3 reflects the program scope and strategy presented at the IID decision, which the FAA is currently analyzing. The FAA intends to use its own analysis, along with industry RFI#3 responses to validate the initial acquisition strategy, improve the overall quality of the initial acquisition solicitation documentation, further refine statement of work requirements and specification requirements.  The resulting effort will likely take advantage of opportunities for cost savings and cost avoidance that will change TFDMs scope and program strategy and improve TFDMs Business Case for FID. The revised scope and program strategy will be reflected in subsequent updates to the solicitation documentation.

5.     QUESTION/ANSWERS: RFI and AVIATION INDUSTRY FORUM QUESTIONS:
Both Aviation Industry Forum and RFI questions may be submitted through April 30, 2014 @ 9:00 A.M.  only.  Q&As allow Industry an opportunity to better understand the RFI and to follow up on the Aviation Industry Forum to be able to address the Questions in a more expeditious manner.  All questions must be sent to the Contracting Officer, (CO) Leslie Fisher, leslie.fisher@faa.gov; phone calls or any unannounced visits will be turned away. Those question(s) received after 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on 4/30/2014 may be addressed after the RFI closing as time permits.

The FAA-TFDM PMO and Contracting Officer will make every effort to address questions from Industry. The audience must be advised that due to the program being in the early stages of developing the SIR, all questions must be submitted in writing through the FAACO website and allow the stated time allowed the program office to review and address each question so that all submitted question may be consolidated and posted for all the Public to view equally. 

Industry shall traced each of their question or comment back to the document, attachment or to Industry Day, the page and or  paragraph must be identified along with any other identification that will assist the FAA in referring back to the area of question for ease of follow through.  			

All responses prepared by the FAA in regards to the RFI and Industry Forum that are received will be consolidated into one publication and posted on FAACO and the TFDM Web page for the ease of Public reference.

<SUBJECT>R--Synopsis of Integration of Advanced Cooling Concepts into Airfoils
<SOLNBR>DE-SOL-0006916
<CONTACT>Donald E. Hafer
<DESC>The US Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), intends to issue a sole source contract to United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in accordance with the FAR 6.302-1.  This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement; and is issued for notification purposes only. Any interested party should contact the below Contract Specialist named for more information regarding this posting, all correspondence shall be received no later than 28 April 2014 at 1600 ET.
UTRC is the sole organization/team  that has access to the Pratt & Whitney airfoil configuration design specifications that are being used for construction and testing of half-span and full-span airfoils for secondary flow leakage improvement, as well as enhanced internal and film cooling during Phase 1 and Phase 2 testing in the Penn State University (PSU) rig during 2014-2018.  As technical partners with PSU in the design, construction, and planned operation of the secondary flow rotating rig, UTRC is cognizant of design readiness criteria essential for instrumentation of the PSU test facility, data acquisition, structural, and operational assessment of the rig for safe operation at moderate temperature (<500&#61616;C) and high speed rotation.  The action is a sole source to UTRC.
NETL has developed innovative advanced airfoil cooling configurations for use in future land-based power generation gas turbines.  NETL plans to conduct bench-scale and subpilot-scale test to reflect realistic test conditions similar to those of the actual operation.  The NETL design acquires the configuration design specifications that are being used at the PSU facility to accurately conduct testing.
Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice. Documentation must be submitted within 10 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your request in writing to George LeMasters via e-mail at George.lemasters@netl.doe.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract action to The Boeing Company (Boeing), 5301 Bolsa Ave, Huntington Beach, CA 92647, for 25 EADR Flash Drive Receiver Assemblies in support of the P-8A aircraft Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) that will interface with Boeing's Acoustic Processor Technical Refresh (APTR) Removable Drive Assembly. The EADR acoustic flash drive receiver assembly is incorporated into the Boeing APTR chassis. The receiver assembly mates with the APTR Removable Drive Assembly creating the unique input/output interface to format and load the media within the Removable Drive Assembly for operational use on the P-8A aircraft; this interface will be established independently of the interface between the Removable Drive Assembly and the APTR Chassis for pre- and post mission tasks. In addition, NAVAIR intends to procure 25 EADR Upgraded Interface Cards to be used to upgrade previously procured acoustics flash drive receivers. The planned delivery dates are 14 flash drives by September 2014 with the remainder along with the upgraded cards by December 2014. This sole source contract action is in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the Boeing P-8A airframe, as well as the sole integrator of the avionics systems, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements on a timely basis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. Any interested party must have the knowledge, expertise, facilities, and qualified personnel necessary to accomplish this effort within schedule requirements. Any respondent must also submit a Statement of Qualifications to demonstrate respondent's ability to perform to the Government's needs within the required response time.

<CONTACT>NICOLE TAYLOR

<a href="mailto:DONOTEMAIL@SSA.GOV">DONOTEMAIL@SSA.GOV</a>
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Basic Contracting Services, Inc. (BCSI), 6170 Research Rd Ste. 205, Frisco, TX, 75033, under the authority of 41 U.S.C ? 3304(a)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements? to continue providing armed guard services at the Second Support Center (SSC).
SSA competitively awarded contract number SS00-09-60012 for armed guard services at the SSC on February 4, 2009 to BCSI.  The agency is competitively acquiring armed guard services now.  In the meantime, we need an extension on the current contract to ensure proper security at the SSC facility, and to eliminate a lapse in security service.  The modification covered under this action will extend the contract period of performance for 60 days, from May 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014.  This contract extension will provide continuity of services for two additional months until we award the new contract.
No other vendor has the ability to provide the required level of support without the possibility of a lapse in service to the Agency.  There are no other contractual vehicles currently available within the Agency to provide the required support in a timely manner.  We have concluded that no source other than BCSI can satisfy SSA?s needs.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561612 and the size standard is $19.0 million.
This notice is for informational purposes only.  This is not a solicitation or request for proposals.  The Government will not award a contract from this announcement, or pay for information received.  A solicitation is NOT available.  Therefore, written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored.  Inquiries related to this notice must be submitted in writing via FEDCONNECT:  https://www.fedconnect.net/fedconnehttps://www.fedconnect.net/fedconnect?doc=SSA-NOI-14-1017&agency=SSA.  NO EMAILS, PHONE CALLS, OR FAXES WILL BE ACCEPTED OR RETURNED.

<DESC>Synopsis:
The USGS Wellsboro Laboratory located at 176 Straight Run Road, Wellsboro, PA is making several upgrades, in order to conserve and increase energy efficiency. 
The magnitude of this construction project is between 75,000 and 150,000 for the complete project.
The solicitation, G14PS00318, will be released on 4/28/2014 for Small Business set-aside, NACIS code 238210, size standard $14.0M.
A site visit is scheduled for 5/7/2014 at 10AM at 176 Straight Run Road, Wellsboro, PA. All contractors are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to attend the site visit.
The tentative close date is 6/5/2014 for quotes. If you have an interest in receiving this solicitation please email cvega@usgs.gov.
This PROJECT ENTAILS conservation of aquifer water by: 1.Limiting pumping of ground water to actual research need (`Well control); 2.Removing and replacing light fixtures in the wet lab areas (`Lighting upgrades); 3.Submetering research pumps and motors to isolate research costs from facility costs (`Installation of well and motor submeters); and 4.Miscellaneous upgrades not encompassed by the above 3 items (`Miscellaneous tasks).  These FOUR COMPONENTS will be discussed separately below, but the individual components are all part of a single project.   The order of priority for the work involved is: 1. Well control a.The highest priority and most involved component will be pump control with installed Variable Frequency Drives (hereafter VFD) utilizing a 4-20ma feedback signal from transducers installed in the facilitys head box (a 50,000 gallon reservoir). This must be integrated with the buildings Tyco alarm system and Siemens Building Control System to notify staff in the event of a failure.  If, during emergency conditions (e.g., storm events with high winds or lightening) the pump control fails, other pumps must be engaged. b.The transducers will need to have a redundant system installed and spare parts will be supplied to the facility for future failures of the sensors and pump controllers since this is a custom installation.
2.Lighting upgrades a.Since LED lights are initially high capital costs, we desire an upgrade to high efficiency T-8 fluorescent lighting to phase out our current T-12 bulbs. Approximately one half of the laboratory has already been upgraded (the dry lab), with the remainder of the facility needing similar upgrades.  
3.Installation of well and motor submeters a.Install flow submeters for the tempered water supporting Wellsboros aquatic organisms/experimental facilities and have remote read-out capabilities integrated with the Building Management System (Siemens System).
4.Miscellaneous tasks a.Install remote on and off switch b.Install water flow meter c.Light fixture upgrade for 2 clean rooms in separate area
Each of the four areas above will be explained in further detail in the PWS when the solicitation is released.

The C-12C (A200) and the C-12D (A200CT) are powered by twin Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-41 turboprop engines. The C-12F (B200C) is powered by twin Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-42 turboprop engines. The C-12J (1900D) is powered by twin Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-65 turboprop engines. The aircraft utilized by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the Pacific Air Command (PACAF), and the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). The aircraft are currently based at 3 Continental United States (CONUS) and 16 Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations (see below). The C-12 mission is to provide time-sensitive movement of personnel and cargo and provide test support.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are only five (5) military bases that host the C-12 aircraft. The remaining sites are either at foreign military bases or commercial facilities.</p>
<p>C-12 CLS support consists of the following services:<br />&bull; Contractor Operated &amp; Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) at each site<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Worldwide spares support capability<br />&bull; Line Maintenance <br />&bull; Depot Level Maintenance (Scheduled and Unscheduled)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Aircraft Condition Inspections<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Drop-in maintenance/repair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Engine Overhaul/Repair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Aircraft Painting<br />&bull; Contract Field Team (CFT) Support <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Aircraft on Ground (AOG) support<br />&bull; Modifications for the aircraft</p>
<p>The C-12 fleet is maintained to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved maintenance standards. All depot maintenance is performed at a Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 145 FAA-certified repair station. <br /><br />The C-12 fleet is supported primarily by Contractor Furnished Property. This includes engines, avionics, and landing gear. The Contractor will be responsible for the spares that support the all systems for the C-12 aircraft. The Government will provide a small amount of spares in support of the fleet. A small number of C-12 aircraft are equipped with a defensive system.</p>

<p>The Government is seeking industry input on questions provided below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RFI Questions</strong></p>

This Request for Information (RFI) is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Responses to the RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>OMB Memorandum M-13-08 directs all executive agencies to use, with limited exceptions, a shared service solution for future modernizations of core accounting or mixed systems. In implementing this policy, OMB is following a guiding principle of "Federal First" whereby executive agencies must consider one of the Federal Shared Services Providers (FSSP) designated by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) as eligible to provide financial management shared services to other executive agencies. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service's Office of the Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT) within Treasury is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) regarding the development and implementation of a shared data transfer capability (e.g., enterprise bus) to facilitate the interaction and communication between mutually interacting software applications. Software applications may include financial systems, procurement systems, e-invoicing systems, inventory systems, or other mixed systems. These software applications may or may not be owned and operated by the Federal government. See attached visual. The purposes of this shared solution include:<br /><br />1. Support the implementation of OMB M-13-08, Implementing Financial Systems Through Shared Services.<br /><br />2. Create an automated solution for facilitating the interaction between software applications that can be deployed within and used across multiple agencies and platforms. <br /><br />3. Facilitate the exchange of data between systems to minimize new interface development for every financial system implementation.<br /><br />4. Develop standard and reusable exchanges (e.g., exchange layouts) for different software solutions that support a common function such as exchange of personal property, inventory information, travel authorizations and vouchers.</p>
<p>A copy of the OMB M-13-08 is located at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-08.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-08.pdf</a><br /><br />See OMB Circular A-123, Appendix D for definitions of the some of the terms (e.g. financial system, mixed system) used above.<br /><br />The anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NACIS) code for this type of requirement is 541512 with a business size of $25.5M. <br />In response to this initial posting we are asking that respondents provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify the company as one or more of the followings: a) small business; b) 8(a) business; c) HUBZone small business; d) small disadvantaged business; e) woman-owned small business; f) veteran-owned small business; g) service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or h) large business. <br /><br />2. Whether your company has a current vehicle (e.g., GSA schedule, GWAC) that may be used to obtain the goods and/or services you describe in responses to items 3 and 4 shown below. <br /><br />3. Provide examples of projects where your company has developed and implemented a common data transfer or similar capability to facilitate the interaction and communication between mutually interacting software applications. In addition to the examples, please provide a customer technical contact and current contact information who could answer questions regarding the project.</p>
<p>As a result of information submitted in response to this Request for Information, the Government may elect to request:</p>
<p>1. Additional clarification of responses received<br />3. Presentation of proposed capabilities<br />2. Demonstrations of available systems</p>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON AVAILABLE GPS EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE</p>
<p>A. INTRODUCTION<br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) is investigating the use of commercially available GPS equipment and software to support FSA's compliance, reporting and other program needs nationwide. The objective of this RFI is to survey commercial GPS vendors on the range of available GPS equipment and software that would be optimal for satisfying FSA program requirements. FSA recognizes that one size does not fit all needs and requirements, but FSA does not have the capacity to support an unlimited number of feasible devices. Therefore, we are looking for the best units for meeting a broad range of program requirements.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to the RFI. No determination as to the viability of this requirement has been made at this point and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this RFI will be announced separately.</p>
<p><br />B. BACKGROUND<br />FSA State and County offices utilize current imagery to maintain agriculture field boundaries to support many different farm related programs. For many years, FSA used large 24"x24" black &amp; white hard copy photo maps with hand drawn boundary lines. This transitioned to the use of digital ortho imagery with the introduction of geographic information system (GIS) applications in the mid 1990's. Currently, FSA contracts for new imagery that is acquired on a three-year or better cycle under the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).</p>
<p>FSA, as part of its information technology (IT) modernization program, purchased GPS units, differential receivers, cables, batteries and other peripherals starting in 2003. These units have been used regularly by the 2200+ FSA State and County offices to support and manage farm program delivery. This equipment is now significantly out of date and difficult to support. It is also now clear that for current and future applications a single device type is unlikely to meet all of FSA requirements in a cost effective manner.</p>
<p><br />C. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (Requirements)<br />For purposes of the RFI, FSA requests information on commercially available GPS equipment and software to support FSA's compliance, reporting and other program needs nationwide. This could include different levels of horizontal and vertical accuracy. Certain programs requirements could require accuracy of 1 meter or better, whereas others could be in the 1-3 meter range. Please do not submit information for GPS equipment with less than 3 meter horizontal accuracy (3 meter or better). Information about equipment designed for recreational uses (hiking, jogging, car navigation, etc.) with insufficient accuracy and capabilities should not be included. Achieving these different levels of accuracy could include both real time and post processing options.</p>
<p><br />Please respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>GPS Equipment Questions:</p>
<p>1. Ease of use, especially for staff that may have limited technical experience.<br />2. Ability to generate custom menus, pull down options, and templates.<br />3. Equipment and software options and information for achieving real time and post processing accuracies at 1 meter or better or 1-3 meter. <br />4. For both real time and post process are signals or data other than GPS and GLONASS used? If so, list options and recommendations.<br />5. Accuracy levels for both moving and stationary collection, including time on site requirements.<br />6. Is post-processing required for highest accuracy or not. If so, what software is recommended? <br />7. Data input and output options. Formats with native support and conversion options. <br />8. Current or planned support for precision agriculture formats and data.<br />9. Number of channels and current or planned support for signal sources (GPS, GLONASS, others).<br />10. Options or capabilities for achieving desired accuracy levels in areas with vegetation canopy, mountainous or uneven terrain, or other limits to GNSS or support signal access. <br />11. Battery specifications (battery life, proprietary/commercial, rechargeable/not, replacement cost, etc.).<br />12. Map reference data included (refresh cost/frequency, proprietary, level of detail).<br />13. Distance and area calculations and other internal or post processing functions.<br />14. Unit size, weight, screen size, I/O connectivity (wireless, Bluetooth, USB, etc.), included and optional cables and accessories.<br />15. Are devices handheld only, used with an external antennae and tripod, both, other? <br />16. Ruggedized or not (waterproof, drop distance, etc)<br />17. Internal camera, microphone, speaker, OS, internal/external memory.<br />18. Operating manuals (hardcopy, digital, or online)<br />19. Support within and between different devices. For example can data, processes, and software work with higher end (&le; 1 meter) and mid-range (&ge; 1 meter) equipment? <br />20. Backward and forward compatible. Support of older/newer equipment with older/newer devices, data, processes, software.</p>
<p>GPS Software Questions:</p>
<p>1. Compatibility with GIS systems such as Esri products and formats<br />2. Process for uploading waypoints and tracks<br />3. API for integration with custom applications<br />4. Post-processing options and requirements<br />5. Data input and output options and format types<br />6. Other software required to input, output, or process data such as Windows Mobile Device Center <br />7. Operating manuals (hardcopy, digital, or online)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Contractual/Pricing Questions:</p>
<p>1. GSA pricing, quantity discounts, bulk purchasing agreements <br />2. Multi-year, multi-generation, multi-device pricing, support <br />3. Warranty, service plans<br />4. Software licensing (cost, desktop, server, dongle, etc)</p>
<p><br />D. INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS<br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:30 P.M. (Mountain Time) on May 2, 2014. Please submit responses electronically to michelle.clifford@slc.usda.gov</p>
<p>The following instructions establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and content of the responses:<br />- Please address all questions and requirements and include feedback on all related topics, including application implementation costs, licensing costs, schedules, and risks.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing a compact scanning Dopplar Lidar. NOAA is not seeking vendors to design, develop, and then produce this requirement; we are seeking vendors already capable of providing a working solution.
<p>NOAA ESRL requires a compact scanning Doppler lidar to characterize dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer. The lidar will need to have high spatial and temporal resolution and sufficient sensitivity to provide profiles through the lower 3-5km of the atmosphere (depending on aerosol concentrations). The system will be capable of long-term, autonomous operation, and remote control via the internet.</p>

<p>&bull; The system must have a scan queue with the following properties:<br />o Controllable via the internet.<br />o Must have the ability to program and control a sequence of continuous scans (as opposed to only a sequence of step and stare scans),<br />o Must have the ability to automatically switch between preselected scan queues depending on the time of day - for at least 8 pre-selected times during the day. (For example daytime mode vs nighttime mode.)<br />&bull; The instrument must be eye safe at the beam aperture.<br />&bull; The instrument must have a sealed environmental enclosure and has to operate under ambient temperatures ranging from -15 to + 40 C.<br />&bull; The system has to operate autonomously and needs to be remotely controllable via an internet connection.<br />&bull; The system must have a real-time processor that calculates and displays range resolved estimates of line-of-sight velocity and intensity.<br />&bull; Types of data displays required:<br />o AScope : single beam line plot <br />o RTI : Range-time indicator displays<br />o Polar : Displays for scanning data<br />&bull; The instrument will have at least a one-year warrantee.<br />&bull; Manufacturer delivery time to NOAA must be 12 weeks or less from execution of purchase order.<br />&bull; Processed Data format: <br />o The lidar system must create and store files of processed data to the disk.<br />o These files will contain range resolved estimates of radial velocity and signal to noise ratio. <br />o Each profile of estimates will be time tagged<br />o Each file will contain information on site location and processing parameters <br />o If the processed data files are binary, the format of the files will be provided so that NOAA/CSD can develop computer programs to read these files.<br />&bull; Raw data format:<br />o The lidar system must create and store files of raw data to the disk.<br />o The raw data can either be autocovariance or spectral data for each gate or digitizer point.<br />o The time resolution of the raw data can be at the same rate as the processed data (in this case the raw data should represent averages of all shots taken during the interval).<br />o If the raw data files are binary, the format of the files will be provided so that NOAA/CSD can develop computer programs to read these files.<br />&bull; Noise data format:<br />o If the system takes automatic noise files, these files will be saved so that they can be used in re-processing. <br />o If the noise data files are binary, the format of the files will be provided so that NOAA/CSD can develop computer programs to read these files.<br />&bull; Demonstrated capability: The vendor must have produced and sold a sufficient number of units so that their performance in the field can be evaluated.</p>
<p>Additional Requirement<br />&bull; Sensitivity: The system must be able to consistently provide radial wind and intensity estimates through the depth of the atmospheric boundary layer with at a rate of 2Hz and processing gate width of 30m. The maximum range to which useful velocity measurement can be obtained for varying atmospheric conditions will be used as an evaluation criteria. (higher sensitivity/further range is preferred)<br />&bull; Precision of velocity and intensity measurements (higher precision is preferred)<br />&bull; Range resolution of measurement (higher resolution is preferred)<br />&bull; Time resolution of measurement (higher resolution is preferred)<br />&bull; Minimum range of measurement (smaller minimum range is preferred)<br />&bull; Hemispheric scanner capabilities: <br />o Range of azimuth and elevation angles (larger range preferred)<br />o Pointing precision (higher precision preferred)<br />o Scanning speeds (larger range of scanning speed preferred)<br />&bull; Range of measurable line of sight wind speeds (larger range is preferred)<br />&bull; Size, weight, and power requirements (smallest weight, size and power requirements are preferred)<br />&bull; Optical focus control (automatic/remote control is preferred)<br />&bull; Ability of system to synchronize to UTC time is preferred<br />&bull; Ability to make depolarization measurement is preferred<br />&bull; Real-time wind profile calculations and display are preferred<br />&bull; Scan Queue: The lidar shall have the ability to synchronize scans relative to the absolute time of day. Ideally the scan queue could be reset at specific intervals of time after every hour. For example - starting a sequence of scans every 20 minutes after the hour: 1:00, 1:20,1:40,2:00,2:20 ... etc. The goal of this requirement is the ability to synchronize the scans so that the lidar performs the same scans at the same time every hour (or fraction of hour as specified by the time increment). The ideal time increments would be 0, 15, 20,30 minutes after the hour.<br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 541512 and the small-business size standard is $25.5M.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought<br />RESPONSES REQEUSTED FROM ALL INTERESTED FIRMS (LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES)
<p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (market survey). This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.</p>
<p>This U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District, is performing market research for the following potential construction requirement:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District (POH) has a requirement for the repair of the Laupahoehoe Breakwater which is located off the north east side of the island of Hawaii, near the Hamakua Coast. The project consists of a 200-foot long breakwater, 60-foot long wave absorber, 9.5 feet deep entrance channel, and a 7.5 feet deep turning basin. The project involves repair of the breakwater of Laupahoehoe Harbor.</p>
<p>This is a design-bid-build project.<br />The North American Industry Classification code (NAICS) is 237990 -- Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. This requirement will be awarded as a firm fixed price construction contract. The project magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This market survey is to determine the constructability and logistical requirements for the proposed breakwater repair. The Government may use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make an appropriate acquisition decision for this project. The type of solicitation issued and the manner of advertisement may depend on the responses to this sources sought synopsis.<br />Respondents should also consider the geographical location of this project. Construction contracts awarded by the Army Corps of Engineers require compliance with EM 385-1-1 Safety Manual.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />A. Name of firm with address, phone number, point of contact, CAGE code or DUNS number. Indicate whether or not your firm is a U.S. firm or a foreign firm.<br />B. Size of firm including category of small business, such as 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, or SDVOSB, large business. <br />C. Firm's Bonding Capability and Capacity, in terms of U.S. dollars (performance and payment bonds will be required).<br />D. Background information: This project will rehabilitate and repair an existing breakwater located in Laupahoehoe Small Boat Harbor, on the island of Hawaii. The work will require the grouting of centerline of the breakwater from the ocean floor to the crest, placement of four (4) additional 30-ton concrete armor units in the assigned placement area at the head of the breakwater, and repair of dislodged stones on the armor layer revetment. A detailed scope of work is provided in the attachments. The grouting work is entails drilling from the crest of the breakwater down to the existing seafloor and grouting the breakwater from the bottom up. The required drilling pattern for each breakwater cell is shown in the attached section. The outer rows of the grouting will require a grout mix with an initial set time of 20 seconds or less and have a 28 -day compressive strength of 1,200 psi and the inner row of the grouting will require a 3-5 inch slump with a 28-day compressive strength of 5,000 psi. For placement of the 4 additional concrete armor units, it is assumed that the crane shall be operated on the location shown on the attached plan. Structural details have been provided to show dimensions of the existing breakwater structure. It is the contractor's responsibility to repair any damages to the breakwater and to replace armor units that are damaged during the placement process.</p>
<p>E. The State/County roadway systems generally consists of two (2) lanes (one lane each direction, with 11 to 12 feet wide lanes). The access road to the small boat harbor is approximately 15 feet wide with a typical grade of approximately 2% with some areas having a grade up to 5%. There exists a 10-ton capacity bridge (15 feet wide x 50 feet long) over a stream crossing along the access road to the project site.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the crane needed for this project will be mobilized from off island and will be transported by vessel to Hilo Harbor. The crane and required supplies/material shall then be transported on existing State and Local roadways from Hilo Harbor to Laupahoehoe Small Boat Harbor.</p>
<p>F. Answer specifically the following market survey questions:</p>
<p>1. The anticipated depth of drilling required varies from 9' to 30'. Does the contractor have the capability of drilling through this range of depths through basalt armor stones ranging from 1 to 7 tons in size? If yes, what is the maximum diameter hole that can be drilled without requiring a custom bit size? Would air track or hydraulic drilling be used? Would the drilling compromise the integrity of the stone being drilled?</p>
<p>2. Does the contractor have experience with marine grouting operations? Provide a brief synopsis of previous experience. Ensure the following is covered, description and location of project; total grout volume placed; wave environment in the project area; description of grout mixtures used (including but not limited to strength and initial set times of the mixtures); approximate contract cost; contractor's role (i.e. was the work accomplished by the contractor or was the contractor's previous experience as a prime with grouting work done by a sub-contractor?).</p>
<p>3. What method of grouting would be proposed to achieve a bottom up placement?</p>
<p>4. Does the contractor have previous experience with placement/handling of concrete armor units in a marine environment? Provide a brief synopsis of the previous experience. Ensure the following is covered, description and location of project; type and weight of armor unit; approximate contract cost; contractor's role, (i.e. was the work accomplished by the contractor or was the contractor's previous experience as a prime and concrete armor unit placement/handling done by a sub-contractor?).</p>
<p>5. Does the contractor have access to equipment to accomplish the work given the constraints noted in the project description? If yes, what are the dimensions and weight of such equipment? What model of equipment would be used for the work? Would temporary measures be required to work safely on (and avoid structural damage to) the breakwater? If yes, describe the measures that would be used to work safely on (and avoid structural damage to) the breakwater.</p>
<p>6. Can the equipment and necessary supplies/materials be transported to the project site intact? <br />a. Does the weight of the equipment and supplies/material exceed the allowable bridge capacity? If yes, what measures would be taken to reinforce the bridge or construct a temporary bridge? <br />b. OR, If the equipment has to be broken down for transport, what is the approximate area of the footprint required to reassemble the equipment at the project site? <br />c. Excluding the bridge discussed above, are the roads in the area suitable for transporting the necessary equipment to the project site? If not, how would the roads need to be modified to enable transport of the necessary equipment to the project site?</p>
<p>7. Does the work and storage area in the attachments provide a sufficient area for construction operations? If not, how much additional area would be required?</p>
<p>Where to send responses: <br />Submit responses to Dayna Matsumura via email at Dayna.N.Matsumura@usace.army.mil</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number F1M3T44058A001. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, SC 29404 intends to award a sole source contract for a hydraulic lift cylinder for a lavatory truck at Joint Base Charleston.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Phoenix Metal Products, 3000 Industrial AVE #3 FT. Pierce, Florida 34946. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (15) (16) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b) (ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628th Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC 29404.</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) Description of Supplies/Services: replace a failing hydraulic lift cylinder on lavatory truck.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The cylinder needs to have a special base plate welded to the bottom of the cylinder for proper fitment and safety.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previous purchases of similar items.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A search using GSA.gov and SBA.gov did not yield any sources capable of providing this requirement.</p>
<p>(9) Interested Sources: A random sampling of companies listing NAICS 333995, hydraulic cylinders, could only supply the cylinder without the attached base plate.</p>
<p>(10) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />None at this time.</p>
<p>(11) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Address questions to A1C Denise Hinojosa, Contract Specialist, at (843) 963-3310, fax (843) 963-5183, email denise.hinojosa@us.af.mil or SSgt Daniel C. Tureac, Contracting Officer, Phone (843) 963-3304, email nicole.smith.3@us.af.mil.</p>

<br />The  United States Agency for International Development, Regional Development Mission for Asia (USAID/RDMA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for the anticipated "Catch Certification and Traceability Systems for Sustainable Fisheries in Asia" activity. The RFI offers the opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to provide recommendations on approaches for establishing a regional Catch Certification and Traceability (CCT) system to achieve sustainable fisheries in Asia. The implementation of CCT systems has been identified as a priority by Asian regional fisheries bodies (see Attachment) for combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing and promoting the Ecosystems Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). In responding to this RFI, significant emphasis should be placed on discrete and actionable interventions USAID/RDMA could potentially take to support implementation of regional CCT systems to achieve sustainable fisheries in Southeast Asia through private sector engagement and public private partnerships.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District intends to extend  firm-fixed-price with Economic Price Adjustment(EPA) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), sole sourcing to the current BPA holders under W912DR-09-A-0004 (Cartus Corporation), W912DR-09-A-0005 (Franconia Real Estate Services, Inc. dba Re/Max Allegiance Relocation Services), W912DR-09-A-0006 (WHR Group, Inc.) and W912DR-09-A-0007 (TRC Global Solutions, Inc.).  Extension awards will be made on or before 17 May 2014, under the authority FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source (or a limited number of responsible sources) and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br>  <br> The four current incumbent DNRP BPA holders are highly specialized service suppliers and are the only capable sources available for the imminent extension start date and short performance period contemplated with the BPA and program knowledge, trained staff, system access and service capability to provide the required services timely, properly and consistently.  <br>  <br> These BPAs were obtained through competition and their rates were deemed to be competitive with the rest of the marketplace at the time of award. Those rates remain in effect today and are still considered competitive. Also DoD requires accurate, concise, and timely reports to monitor contractor activity, manage and evaluate the DNRP and the contract, and provide DoD and component management with program information. Contractors are required to complete electronic status reports on acquired properties and properties under management as requested/scheduled utilizing NRPO's internet enabled electronic program management system. The training required becoming familiar and proficient with this reporting system would result in unacceptable lost time before new contractors were fully functional and additional start up costs and operating costs for new contractors. <br>  <br> There are no practical alternatives to utilization of other than the current BPA holders. The short available lead time prior to the requested BPA extension start date is not sufficient to publish advance notice and to complete solicitation of other sources and then make new awards. A six month maximum term BPA opportunity would attract few, if any, potential contractors, and any service suppliers other than incumbent contractors would require start up time for staffing, training, system access, and BPA workflow knowledge that would result in unacceptable delays in authorizing/initiating contract services for DoD components and their transferring employees. <br>  <br> Awarding these services under a new contract would cause significant impacts to the Government. These include, but are not limited to impacts caused by not having a trained and experience contractor workforce in place to provide support to the DNRP program, as well as financial and other related issues. The Government could incur financial injury as a result of duplication of costs associated with providing services, training, augmentation of supplies and materials should another vendor be awarded this effort. Schedule delays will be incurred as well, which will have a direct and adverse impact upon DoD's mission in support of DNRP. It would take a minimum of ninety (90) days to recruit and train the new personnel required to perform DNRP services using new vendors. <br>  <br> Market research was conducted as part of the new effort to assess other possible courses of action, and it has be determined that a Full and Open competition is the most viable approach for the long term DNRP support requirements. Market Research was not separately conducted for the proposed six month extension, because, as discussed above, there are only limited sources, the current providers, who can provide the required services within the required timeframe.  <br>  <br> The NAICS code is 531210 with a small business size of $7,000,000.00. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based upon the excessive cost to the Government in replacing current Government requirement and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. The Government shall not reimburse interested sources for any information provided. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice and any information provided will not be used as part of any subsequent solicitation requirement. All responses shall be sent via electronic e-mail to the POC, Karen Truxal at Karen.Truxal@usace.army.mil.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored. <br>

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based upon the excessive cost to the Government in replacing current Government requirement and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Extension awards will be made on or before 17 May 2014, under the authority FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source (or a limited number of responsible sources) and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br>  <br> The four current incumbent DNRP BPA holders are highly specialized service suppliers and are the only capable sources available for the imminent extension start date and short performance period contemplated with the BPA and program knowledge, trained staff, system access and service capability to provide the required services timely, properly and consistently.  <br>  <br> These BPAs were obtained through competition and their rates were deemed to be competitive with the rest of the marketplace at the time of award. Those rates remain in effect today and are still considered competitive. Also DoD requires accurate, concise, and timely reports to monitor contractor activity, manage and evaluate the DNRP and the contract, and provide DoD and component management with program information. Contractors are required to complete electronic status reports on acquired properties and properties under management as requested/scheduled utilizing NRPO's internet enabled electronic program management system. The training required becoming familiar and proficient with this reporting system would result in unacceptable lost time before new contractors were fully functional and additional start up costs and operating costs for new contractors. <br>  <br> There are no practical alternatives to utilization of other than the current BPA holders. The short available lead time prior to the requested BPA extension start date is not sufficient to publish advance notice and to complete solicitation of other sources and then make new awards. A six month maximum term BPA opportunity would attract few, if any, potential contractors, and any service suppliers other than incumbent contractors would require start up time for staffing, training, system access, and BPA workflow knowledge that would result in unacceptable delays in authorizing/initiating contract services for DoD components and their transferring employees. <br>  <br> Awarding these services under a new contract would cause significant impacts to the Government.

<CONTACT>Kathryn Rice, Phone 8433298016, Email Kathryn.A.Rice@usace.army.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br /><br />This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source contract pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, which applies when the supplies/services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate a contract with Applanix Corporation (APPLANIX), Ontario, Canada, for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Charleston District (USACE Charleston), who has the following requirement: <br /><br />1. One (1) new position and orientation systems with real time kinematic (RTK) capability meeting or exceeding the specifications as follows: Applanix Model: POS MV WaveMaster RTK V5
<p>2. One (1) PCS upgrade to its Applanix RTK POS M/V 320 position and orientation systems with real time kinematic (RTK) capability meeting or exceeding the specifications as follows:<br />Equipment Requirements:<br />RTK POS MV VX to RTK POS MV V5 upgrade <br />POS MV Computer System, Rack Mount PCS (RM) with RTK option <br />IMU adapter cable (Lemo to KPT) <br />USB flash drives, 4 GB (quantity 2) <br />POSView and manuals (on CD) <br />Shipping case <br />GNSS antennas (quantity 2) <br /><br />3. One (1) Semi Ruggedized Control System meeting or exceeding the specifications as follows:<br />Panasonic Toughbook CF-53 or comparable<br />Windows 7 Pro OS<br />Intel Core i5-2520M 2.50GHz<br />4GB RAM<br />320GB(7200rpm) Hard Drive<br />14.0" LED LCD, 1366 x 768<br />Outdoor readable, up to 800 nit<br />DVD Super Multi Drive<br />3 Year Toughbook Preferred Warranty</p>
<p>USACE Charleston is seeking to purchase additional hardware, upgrade existing software support, and training for our new and previously installed POSPAC equipment. (SEE Attached SOW). In order to maintain compatibility with the current Applanix POS M/V 320 system on the District survey vessel and POSPAC MMS, Applanix Corporation is the only source able to provide the hardware and maintenance. Applanix POS M/V Wavemaster RTK V5 and Applanix POS M/V 320 V5 PCS System are the only products that will provide positioning and orientation to meet USACE requirements of automated hydrographic surveying operations and real time kinematic (RTK) capability at required critical accuracy and performance specifications. Since 2008 USACE has tailored its vessels, employee training, workflows, and products based on the Applanix Marine Positioning Systems. This has streamlined costs and increased efficiency versus operating additional systems made and supported by other manufacturers. Therefore, APPLANIX is the only known responsible source that can provide the inertial sensor system upgrades and new system procurement, and the software licensing and maintenance required for this procurement. In order for the Government to remove or overcome any barriers to competition, it would require the purchase of all new equipment and supporting software deemed compatible with all USACE's vessels. In doing so, the Government would incur substantial duplication of costs not likely to be recovered through competition. This request is required in order to continue the daily operational mission of the District.<br /><br />Responses to this notice must be provided by Monday, 28 March 2014 0900AM EST. Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirement. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. EST time, March 28, 2014. The responses may be submitted via e-mail to Kathryn A. Rice, Contract Specialist, at Kathryn.A.Rice@usace.army.mil,</p>

<DESC>The Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Hood, Texas intends to award a Firm Fixed-Priced, sole source, medical supply contract to Richard Wolf for the purchase of two Rigid Endoscopes, 30 and 70 degree and two Flexible Endoscopes with Camera to support clinical cystoscopy procedures.  Award will be made on or before 5 May 2014, under the authority of 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source.  Richard Wolf is the only known manufacturer of the endoscopes which are compatible with the current cystoscopy towers.  Selecting a company other than Richard Wolf would require the purchase of new accessory products resulting in additional costs in excess of $30,000.  Market research shows other companies offer endoscopes, however, they are not compatible with the current Government owned cystoscopy towers.  This equipment is for use at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC), Fort Hood, Texas.  CRDAMC is a vital component of the installation's Total Customer Satisfaction Objective and acquisition of this equipment supports that objective.   <br> The purpose of this supply contract is to provide the necessary medical equipment which allows the clinic to provide cystoscopies at full productivity at CRDAMC.   Endoscopes are an integral part of performing cystoscopies in the clinic.  Without this equipment, the ability to provide cystoscopy procedures is reduced which would have an immediate negative impact on current health care operations and current health care services for our soldiers, civilians, and beneficiaries.   <br>  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 334510 with a small business size standard of 500.   This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based upon the excessive cost to the Government in replacing current Government owned equipment and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  The Government shall not reimburse interested sources for any information provided.  No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice and any information provided will not be used as part of any subsequent solicitation requirement.  All responses shall be sent via electronic e-mail to the POC, Clarence 'Craig' Cude at clarence.c.cude.civ@mail.mil.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  <br>

These running suits will be shipped from their current location at the KYLOC warehouse in Frankfort, KY to organic Marine Corps warehouse facilities in Barstow, California. Such action supports a recent Marine Corps directive to consolidate all gear and equipment in organic, Marine Corps owned-and-operated warehouse facilities for storage. Estimated quantity of running suits to-be-shipped is 150,000. The estimated contract value for this procurement is $90,000. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

As the USMC running suits are presently being stored in KYLOC warehouse facilities, to have an entity other than KYLOC ship the running suits from the KYLOC warehouse in Frankfort, KY to Marine Corps warehouses in Barstow, CA would intuitively increase costs to the Government. Further, such action would require special coordination between private industry, State Government, and the Federal Government to support shipping of the respective gear. As such, practically speaking, there is only one entity that can provide the required service, the KYLOC warehouse in Frankfort, KY. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><br />This requirement is being solicited on a brand name or equal basis. The following outlines a configuration known to satisfy the Government's requirement and reflects the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that reflect the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs.

<p>Navy CNIC N926, Child and Youth Programs (CYP), requires technical support for the management, requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, hosting, accreditation, and transition of the Department of Defense (DoD) Request for Care system, MilitaryChildCare.com (MCC).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MCC is a singular secure DoD web-based application that enables all DoD-eligible customers worldwide to request child care services for individual child and family needs. It is based on the MCC software baseline previously developed for CNIC and piloted in Hawaii at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam and Marine Corps Base Hawaii, in Nevada at Nellis Air Force Base (AFB), and in Florida at Naval Air Station (NAS) Key West.</p>
<p>MCC provides a single online gateway to military-operated or military-subsidized child and youth care options across all services for U.S. military families worldwide. It allows families to choose from a wide range of child care options, standardizes the placement process, and makes it easier for families to identify and request child care. As a result, families make more informed decisions about the care available, and placement occurs more quickly and efficiently regardless of the delivery system.</p>

<DESC>This advertisement is for ARCHITECT &amp; ENGINEERING SERVICES for two types of projects using USPS Building Design Standards, (1) New Construction, and (2) Repair and Alteration (R&amp;A) projects. A firm must be willing to perform services required under both types of projects. The work includes site adaptation of USPS CADD-based standard plans for new facilities and expansions (very limited number of these occurring nationwide), design services for Repair and Alteration projects, preparation of contract documents, contract administration, commissioning support, and inspection services. The contract will cover postal facilities in Western Pennsylvania, but may also be used for projects in the entire state. See attached list of counties. The contract will have a base term of two years and will have three (3) one-year renewal options. The total contract amount over the five-year period cannot exceed $9,500,000. Individual work orders will be negotiated for each project. Work orders for any one project cannot exceed $500,000. Typical work orders range from $2,500 to $50,000. Firms that have the qualifications to perform the services described are invited to submit two copies of completed SF-330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications. SF-330 can be found at www.gsa.gov under the Forms Library.
<p>Firms must also submit a statement that addresses the following questions: <br />(1) How long has the technical team been working together? Provide areas of expertise for each team member, and provide details on how the technical team will be structured and managed. <br />Note: The technical team is defined as all architects, engineers, project managers, and construction administrators that will be directly assigned to support this contract. <br />(2) What experience does the team have in Repair and Alteration projects? Provide information on specific projects. <br />(3) What experience does the team have in historical preservation projects? Provide information on specific projects. <br />(4) What experience does the team have in responding to emergencies (i.e. flooding, fire, storm damage, accidents resulting in structural damage, etc.)? Provide information on specific projects. <br />(5) Provide typical office information on work hours, days of operation, emergency contact information, and evidence of current errors and omissions insurance of $200,000 per claim.</p>
<p>All firms must be licensed to perform Architect and Engineering services in Western Pennsylvania.

Consultants do not have to reside in the state of Pennsylvania. Firms must fill out and return the attached "License Matrix".</p>
<p>Prime firms must be located in Western Pennsylvania, however, they must be willing to work on projects anywhere in the state of Pennsylvania, should the need arise. The location requirement can be met in one of two ways: <br />1. The prime firm's sole office is in Western Pennsylvania, or <br />2. The prime firm has one or more branch offices in Western Pennsylvania that have been in operation for a minimum of one year and all the architectural design, coordination, and management of the projects will be performed in those offices.</p>
<p>There is no restriction on the geographical location of consultants. Prime firms that plan to use resources from more than one of their offices in Western Pennsylvania must indicate on their SF-330 the staffing compositions of each of those offices.</p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated on the content of their SF-330 and the responses to the questions and items above. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, contracts may be awarded to more than one A/E firm, and contracts may be used in neighboring states. The successful firms' compliance with licensure requirements in neighboring states will be checked prior to receiving any work in those states. Participation of minority-owned and woman-owned businesses in U.S. Postal Service architect-engineer selections is encouraged but is not an evaluation factor. It is prohibited to pay any fee, commission, percentage, or brokerage fee to any person or firm contingent upon or resulting from award of a contract for this project. Submissions will not be retained or returned. This is not a request for proposal. Submit the required documentation to USPS Eastern Facilities Construction CMT, Attn: Western Pennsylvania A/E Selection, PO Box 27497, Greensboro, NC 27498-1103 or 7029 Albert Pick Rd, Ste 300, Greensboro, NC 27409-9521.</p>

Synopsis:

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective April 18, 2014 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 73 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for the Core Business Line (CBL) for Schedule 073, Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services.

This solicitation is issued electronically only. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. Effective November 22, 2010, all products added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Numbers (SINs) 302-49, Refrigeration Equipment - including Blast Freezers, Chillers; Commercial Refrigerators; Commercial Freezers; Dairy Cases; Deli Cases; Walk-In Refrigerators; Walk-In Freezers; Ice Dispensers; Ice Making Equipment; Ice Storage Bins and Carts, and SIN 375-361 - Biodegradable Cleaner/Degreaser (Water Based) Non-Phenolic and Non-Petroleum - Products approved by USDA for Food Handling Areas, must meet the following Government standards. Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies. In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated these two SINs on Schedule 73, which will require qualifications.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Software License Addendum (APR 2010) (a) This Addendum incorporates certain terms and conditions relating to Federal procurement actions.

(e) Assignment: Payments may only be assigned in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 3727, and FAR Subpart 32.8, ?Assignment of Claims.? (f) Invoices: Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. Section 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A?125, Prompt Payment. (g) Patent and Copyright Infringement: Patent or copyright infringement suits brought against the United States as a party may only be defended by the U.S. Department of Justice (28 U.S.C. Section 516). (h) Renewal of Support after Expiration of this Award: Service will not automatically renew after expiration of the initial term of this agreement.

Contractors shall first meet the above minimum technical factors and then will be evaluated on the technical factors. TECHNICAL FACTORS: 1) Past performance and related experience to include phone numbers and points of contact and related experience which demonstrates quoter has performed EMMA Inspections on a Twin Otter DHC-6-300 aircraft in accordance with CAP Inspection program. Describe the quoter's overall experience, years in business, and contractor's ability to accomplish the work. Number of inspections, relevancy of work, and recency of work will be evaluated. Contractor shall provide the amount of similar work accomplished in the last 12 months ; 2) Provide demonstrated experience in performing the maintenance items listed in A.2 of the SOW; 3) Location of contractors FBO facility or facilities.

<p>(vi) Description of Requirements</p>
<p>A. Overview</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide scientific support to the Secretariat Office of the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC), including writing position papers consistent with the organizations charter and mission, corresponding with ISC Heads of Delegations and species working group chairs, and coordinating duties of ISC staff.</p>
<p>B. Statement of Work</p>
<p>The ISC was established in 1995 through an intergovernmental agreement between Japan and the United States (USA). Since its establishment and first meeting in 1996, the ISC has undergone a number of changes to its charter and name (from the Interim Scientific Committee to the International Scientific Committee) and has adopted a number of guidelines for its operations. The two main goals of the ISC are (1) to enhance scientific research and cooperation for conservation and rational utilization of the species of tuna and tuna-like fishes which inhabit the North Pacific Ocean during a part or all of their life cycle; and (2) to establish the scientific groundwork for the conservation and rational utilization of these species in this region. The Committee is made up of voting Members from coastal states and fishing entities of the region as well as coastal states and fishing entities with vessels fishing for highly migratory species in the region, and non-voting members from relevant intergovernmental fishery and marine science organizations, recognized by all voting Members.</p>
<p>The ISC Secretariat, together with the species and statistics Working Groups, provide scientific advice on the stocks and fisheries of tuna and tuna-like species in the North Pacific Ocean to the Member governments and regional fisheries management organizations. Fishery data tabulated by ISC members, and peer-reviewed by the Working Groups, form the basis for research conducted by the ISC. To facilitate the goals of the ISC, while ensuring the timely completion and dissemination of scientific advice, scientific support for the Secretariat Office is required</p>
<p>This is a 4 month (April 24, 2014 - August 24, 2014) collaborative project with Project Sponsors Gerard DiNardo of NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) and Sarah Shoffler of NOAA Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Science Center. The Contractor will write position papers consistent with the organizations charter and mission for dissemination at the 14th meeting of the ISC Plenary (ISC14) and correspond with ISC Heads of Delegations and species working group chairs regarding ISC science. In addition, the Contractor will coordinate the duties of the ISC Web Master and Database Coordinator at ISC14, as well as workshop/meeting rapporteurs, to ensure completion of workshop and meeting reports.</p>
<p>To facilitate the tasks the contractor will be provided access to all ISC documents and will be required to attend ISC14. The Contractor will assist with the dissemination of documents leading up to ISC14, as well as the completion and dissemination of the final report of ISC14. The Contractor will not distribute their notes or report to the public.</p>
<p>C. Deliverables</p>
<p>An initial meeting with collaborators to discuss goals and objectives will be required and is scheduled for mid-summer 2014. Weekly progress will be discussed with project sponsors and ISC Chairman via conference calls. The final report from ISC14 is due to the ISC Chair and Vice Chair in by August 1, 2014.</p>
<p>(vii) Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and Acceptance/FOB Point.<br />The purchase order shall begin on or about April 24, 2014 and end on August 24, 2014.</p>
<p>Place of Delivery:<br />NOAA/NMFS/PIFSC<br />1845 Wasp Boulevard, Building 176<br />Honolulu, HI 96818<br />All deliveries shall be FOB Destination.</p>
<p>All Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses listed below are available for download at https://acquisition.gov/far/</p>
<p>(vii) A statement that the provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>(viii) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following evaluation factors apply:</p>
<p>The Government will issue an order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. The following factors will be used to evaluate quotations:</p>
<p>Factor A -- APPROACH AND CAPABILITIES - Offerors will be evaluated based on their corporate and individual qualifications to perform the work; adequacy of equipment, materials and facilities proposed; and experience with the types of operations identified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor B -- PAST PERFORMANCE -- Performance by the offeror and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to all solicitation requirements will be evaluated. The evaluation will include the quality of services previously performed, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction and indication of ability to improve performance through proactive management. Evaluation of this factor will be based on the information contained in the proposal and information provided by references. The government may evaluate past performance by contacting references and/or other sources and may also consider other information available.</p>
<p>Factor C -- PRICE</p>
<p>Although price is the least important evaluation factor, it will not be ignored. The degree of importance of the proposed price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offer or if the contracting officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the government.</p>
<p>Note that any and all costs associated with proposal preparation, are the responsibility of the contractor.</p>

<p>(xii) The following additional clauses are also applicable to this acquisition: Department of Commerce Clauses:</p>
<p>1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY<br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.</p>
<p>1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver. <br />The following additional terms and conditions apply:</p>
<p>52.232-39 UNENFORCEABILITY OF UNAUTHORIZED OBLIGATIONS (JUN 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br />(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. <br />(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>ASSURANCE BY CORPORATIONS REGARDING AN UNPAID DELINQUENT TAX LIABILITY OR A FELONY CONVICTION UNDER ANY FEDERAL LAW (CLASS DEVIATION) (MARCH 2012)</p>

In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair or overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair or overhaul as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair/overhaul of an aircraft component(s).

If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future award consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide repair manuals or OEM repair data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the repair or overhaul as applicable.

The component OEM is Ball Aerospace and Technologies, Cage Code 13993, and their repair facility Cage Code is 0ESR2. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical repair cost.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that-

      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)

(End of Clause)

852.211-70 SERVICE DATA MANUALS
(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.

(b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.

(c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions.

(e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.

(f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.

(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.

(h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.

(i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Transition programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States government's top priorities.  OTI's current engagement in Afghanistan began in 2009. OTI aims to build strong, resilient communities in districts vital to Afghanistan's overall stability and development by strengthening communities' ability to withstand political and social upheaval, insurgent infiltration, and other shocks and pressures as international donor funds and military support draw down. With OTI support, Afghans will be able to rebuild, strengthen and connect their communities to the wider social and political structures. To achieve these objectives, OTI incorporates a number of programming principles that emphasize a process-oriented, Afghan-led approach to implementation.</p>
<p>OTI implements clusters of community-focused small grants through a process-oriented approach with Afghan ownership of decisions and results. In OTI's programming, the project processes are as important as project outputs in contributing to the program's strategic goal of stabilization. The program utilizes both "soft" (e.g., community cohesion jirgas, outreach visits by district government; cultural and recreational activities) and "hard" (e.g., small-scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between vulnerable communities and positive community resiliencies and customary leadership, increasing community cohesion in the process.</p>
<p>The OTI Deputy Country Representative - Afghanistan is a member of the DCHA/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and can be based anywhere in the world, but must be immediately available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to the Afghanistan region. The incumbent may be required to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel in a neighboring country for indefinite periods of time, and would receive applicable allowances at the rate in effect at the destination post at the time of travel. The incumbent must be prepared for uncertainty in regards to the length of time that will be required to remain in the Afghanistan region.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, strong analytical and organizational skills, the exercise of good judgment, discretion and personal responsibility, and ability to communicate with a variety of interlocutors.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Deputy Country Representative has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.  The Deputy Country Representative is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The Deputy Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting his/her supervisor in responding to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Deputy Country Representative is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, military personnel, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies, the military, and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and grant concepts and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising OTI field staff posted in or outside of the main field office, the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, and administrative assistants;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, the military, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs or host government control;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to monitor and assess political conditions, implementing partner operational platforms, meet with potential grantees, host government and other program counterparts, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Collaborate on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including national and subnational government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to help ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative in the designated country.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>

<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Address: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 ? Fax: (256) 450-8840 ?

<DESC>Questions and Answers
April 18, 2014

1.	  Do you have the total areas for each of the buildings to be surveyed.  The drawings for Bldg 626 had an area listed, but none of the other drawings had the areas listed.
 The total square footage of each building is not relevant for this requirement.  The VANCHCS is only concerned with areas that have fire protection features (fire wall, smoke wall, fire door, etc.).  These areas are depicted on each map attached.  For example, in building A, only the lobby has fire protection features.  Therefore, only the lobby needs to be inspected.  

2.	 Also, Building 19 appears to have stairs to another floor.  Are there other areas/floors within Building 19 that require surveys?
Please see #1 above.  For building 19, only the areas on the floor plan need to be inspected.

3.	  Please let us know what is the DVBE goal for this above reference project.

You must be a registered veteran-owned small business to bid on this requirement.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).<br />(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.<br />(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>9. 49.502 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

This amendment is to notify all technically acceptable offerors to submit their Final Proposal Revision and technical refresh (including quotes with expanded descriptions for each delivery destination) or updated Final Proposal Revision for VISN 2, NLT the common cut-off date of 5/1/14 at 4:30PM/CST.

<DESC>&nbsp; In our continued effort to receive your suggestions and improve our final solicitation by clearly stating our requirements; we would like to reach out to you once again for some feedback.
<p>&nbsp;Could you please answer questions 1-7 below by providing feedback that reflects:</p>
<p>A.) Your business' experience with customer's (any/all) methodology of specifying their requirements to you?</p>
<p>B.) What has been common practice from these requiring authorities?</p>
<p>C.) What best clarifies to your business the requiring authority's requirements?</p>
<p>&nbsp;1.) As the firefighter's last line of defense when all other safety measures fail, where does specifying composite materials rate in relation to other specification criteria on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being highest priority?</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.) Could a garment and/or a fabric/barrier manufacturer specifically identify to a brand name/model fabric (e.g. PBI Matrix, Gemini, etc.) if provided only performance characteristics (i.e. Trap Tear, THL, TPP, thermal shrinkage, etc.) without receiving the brand name fabric and/or its composition/blend (e.g. 70/30 blend) from the customer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;3.) Would providing just the physical characteristics and/or performance characteristics be difficult for the manufacturer to determine a specific material or composite or would it be left open for interpretation by the garment manufacturer?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, if the government provided just performance characteristics, would garment and fabric/barrier manufacturers understand the need and propose one specific brand name or could it be open for interpretation by the garment manufacturer where multiple fabrics/barriers could be interpreted for multiple comparable composites?</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.) Which fabric and barrier material tests (approved test methods) have variances for test data for each of the physical and/or performance characteristics?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is the test variance (5%, 8%) for each?&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.) Based on corporate experience, do you know of any cases where a municipal and/or government Fire Department provided physical and performance characteristics without providing any brand name identifiers (e.g. Kevlar, Nomex, Ara-shield, etc.) to specify their needs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;6.) What is common industry practice when specifying the need of a Fire Department (i.e. specify using brand name fabrics, specify using brand name garments, specify strictly using performance characteristics, etc.)?</p>
<p>(Please elaborate)</p>
<p>&nbsp;7.) How many "flame resistant thread" choices are available to be used to sew or seam materials within a garment?</p>

Contents of Full Proposal; Per the RFP, Offerors are instructed to provide: <br>  1. Cover sheet <br>  2. Technical proposal <br>  3. Cost or Price Proposal <br>  4. Performance Work Statement (PWS) <br> Does this cover everything? <br>  <br> A2. The PWS is not required. Contents of the full proposal only include a cover sheet, technical proposal and a cost or price proposal. <br>  <br> Q3. Does 'Cover Sheet' include 'Transmittal Letter' and 'Summary' as described in the BAA (IV, FORMAT)? <br>  <br> A3. Yes. <br>  <br> Q4. Regarding 'Technical Proposal', are we correct in presuming RFP '8.1. General'  through '8.4. Program Management and Planning' provides all the topics necessary to describe Exelis' technical capabilities and display experience developing similar RF switch technologies -  In other words the 'Technical Proposal'? <br>  <br> A4. In addition to Section 8, the Offeror need to propose all the  quote mark shall quote mark  requirement statements in the RFP. <br>  <br> Q5. Regarding 'Performance Work Statement (PWS)', please provide clarification as to what exactly this pertains to? <br>  <br> A5. The PWS is not required.  <br>  <br> Q6. Will you help me get the 3 listed documents which are referenced for the performance of the effort: Vehicular Integration for C4ISR/EW inTerOpeRabilitY (VICTORY) Architecture, Version A2, 22 February 2013   Vehicular Integration for C4ISR/EW inTerOpeRabilitY (VICTORY) Standard Specifications, Version 1.6, 14 November 2013   VICTORY Standard Specifications Document Appendix: GPS Receiver Device Interfaces, Version 1.6, 14 November 2013. <br>  <br> A6. For any interested vendors that have not received the VICTORY documents please email Michael.w.levy7.civ@mail.mil and provide your CAGE Code. <br>  <br> Q7. What is the preferred type of contract? <br>  <br> A7. Cost Plus Fixed Fee. <br>  <br> Q8. Can a Firm Fixed Price type contract still be submitted? <br>  <br> A8. Yes <br>  <br> Q9. Is there a pre-defined message set to be used by the external equipment <br> (radio or laptops) and the RF Smart Switch, or is it part of this effort to <br> define that specific message set? <br>  <br> A9.  It is part of this effort to define the specific message set. <br>  <br> Q10.  Per the RFP there's a fifty (50) page limit on responses back to the Government for the RF Smart Switch proposal.  It isn't clear whether this limit includes both the Cost and Technical submittal, or just the Technical Proposal.  <br> Given the amount of data required to support a FAR compliant cost proposal, Sierra Nevada Corporation requests that the 50 page limit only be applied to the Technical response, or barring that, that Appendices not be counted against the page limit.  <br>  <br> A10. The page limit will be 75 pages in total as required with the BAA guidelines.  <br>  <br> Q11. In Section 8.4 of the Radio Frequency (RF) Smart Switch RFP dated April 3rd, 2014, it states that the proposal shall not exceed 50 pages; however, Section IV  quote mark Proposal Preparation Instructions quote mark  of the BAA states that all information provided should not exceed 75 pages.  <br> Can you clarify whether the 50-page limit is for the Technical Proposal only and the remaining 25 pages are for the Cover Letter, Cost Proposal, PWS, etc.?  <br>  <br> A11.  The page limit will be 75 pages in total as required with the BAA guidelines. This includes everything and it will be up to the offerror to choose the limitations for each section.  <br>  <br> Q12. Why has the controller been specified to use Windows 7, and similarly, why has Java been specified as the programming language? We are concerned with meeting real-time performance given these requirements. <br>  <br> A12. The use of Windows 7 and Java are both part of the RF Smart Switch requirements based on the Army current needs.  <br>  <br> Q13. There are very specific requirements for how the Java API is to be constructed. How do you envision using the Java API? For instance, will the Java API be used from anywhere other than the Control Processing GPM?  <br>  <br> A13. For the RF Smart Switch effort, the Java API will only be used in the GPM for controlling the switch operation via the elemental functions. <br>  <br> Q14. Is the USB-3 interface intended to be a master or a slave interface? <br>  <br> A14. The role of the USB-3 on the GPM normally acts as the host to initiate the handshaking to the connected device. This requires that the USB-3 interface to be the master. <br>  <br> Q15. How  quote mark Real Time quote mark  do the USB-3/Serial interfaces need to be?  <br>  <br> A15. The intent of using the USB-3 is its high speed capability. However, unlike RS-232 or RS-422, the USB interface is a share port where one host can be connected to multiple devices simultaneously. This ability allows the device to communicate with the host in a time sharing manners. Therefore the USB-3 needs to be configured for exclusive control of the switch without time sharing its resources. <br> Please see the excerpt below from the RFP requirements:  <br> 5.3.2. Real Time Control Interfaces <br> To meet operational requirements, it is essential that the switch respond to the control commands in real time. The commands shall be transferred via any of the Real Time Control Interfaces. These interfaces shall be programmed to transfer the control commands in real time from end to end. If any delay is imminent, it shall be specified.  <br>  <br> Q16. What is the phase matching requirement? <br>  <br> A16. The RF signal at the active output ports must be the same phase relative to each other. <br>  <br> Q17. How long must the unit absorb the RF energy when all output ports are disconnected? <br>  <br>    A17a. There is no hot switching requirement for this effort. <br>    A17b. The load should be sufficient to dissipate the full input power, at state 0, for an indefinite amount of time. <br>  <br> Q18. What is the tolerance on the Input and Output Impedance specs? <br>  <br> A18. Please refer to the VSWR specification. <br>  <br> Q19. What is the maximum current consumption of the unit? <br>  <br> A19. Assuming that the maximum current is referred to the AC Power of the system chassis rather that the RF Power. Since the RF Smart Switch System is a Laboratory prototype, the unit current consumption shall not exceed the standard AC outlet of 15 Amps. <br>  <br> Q20. Please confirm that the insertion loss spec is independent of the theoretical losses due to splitting the RF signal. <br>  <br> A20. The insertion loss is the maximum total loss of the switch as seen from the output port. I.e. The input RF signal seen at the output port with 3 loads active would be: Pin/3 -Insertion Loss. <br>        <br>  <br> Submission are due no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 02 May 2014.   <br>    <br> For all interested parties that have not received the referenced VICTORY documents please email your request to Michael.w.levy7.civ@mail.mil along with your CAGE Code.      <br>

<DESC>TFDM REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

1.	INTRODUCTION
On March 19, 2014, the TFDM program presented the Business Case analysis data and successfully obtained the Initial Investment Decision (IID). Although the Program achieved a favorable IID, the TFDM program must continue to seek opportunities to increase its affordability and benefit/cost ratio. The first step in achieving this goal is performing RFI #3.

2.	 AVIATION INDUSTRY FORUM 2014
FAA is considering any and all options for structuring the SIR at this time and seeks the input from industry regarding specific risks, and benefits of acquisition strategies.

In addition to this RFI, the TFDM program office may release updates and or draft version of the Statement of Work for industry comment prior to releasing any future SIR or RFP.  Any and all future releases will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities website (FAACO) https://faaco.faa.gov/) and the FAA-TFDM program web site. http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/pmo/proj/tfdm/

TFDM program information, general scope, high level service and system requirements, and initial plans will be presented to industry as part of the FAA Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Program Management Organization (PMO) Industry Forum on April 23 and 24, 2014. The TFDM information presented during this 2-day forum event will be available from the TFDM program office web site.

3.	 FAACO ANNOUNCEMENT
This Request for Information (RFI) #3 announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy at 3.2.1.2.1. 

This RFI will be used by the FAA for information gathering purposes only. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP). The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. Any cost associated with the preparation and submittal of such information, in written format only, is solely at each vendors expense. 

The FAA is anticipating releasing a Full & Open Competition, with a mixture of pricing CLINS, and a period of performance of approximately twelve (12) years. The period of performance is anticipated to be a (5) year base and (7) one year options.

4.	PURPOSE:
The TFDM Program Office is now soliciting input from industry through RFI #3 for assistance in identifying applicable best practices, review and comment of the acquisition statement of work and documentation and information concerning specific questions the FAA has on select aspects of the program. The information provided in this RFI #3 reflects the program scope and strategy presented at the IID decision, which the FAA is currently analyzing. The FAA intends to use its own analysis, along with industry RFI#3 responses to validate the initial acquisition strategy, improve the overall quality of the initial acquisition solicitation documentation, further refine statement of work requirements and specification requirements.  The resulting effort will likely take advantage of opportunities for cost savings and cost avoidance that will change TFDMs scope and program strategy and improve TFDMs Business Case for FID. The revised scope and program strategy will be reflected in subsequent updates to the solicitation documentation.

5.     QUESTION/ANSWERS: RFI and AVIATION INDUSTRY FORUM QUESTIONS:
Both Aviation Industry Forum and RFI questions may be submitted through April 30, 2014 @ 9:00 A.M.  only.

<p>Approximate USF: 19,200<br />Space Type: Office</p>
<p>Lease Term: 10 years</p>
<p><br />Additional Requirements:</p>
<p>In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, furniture relocation and non-productive agency downtime. The Government will relocate only if consideration of economic and other factors are supported and are advantageous to the Government. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.</p>
<p>Space must be ready for occupancy no later than November 2014</p>
<p><br />Expressions of Interest must include the following information:</p>
<p>- Building ownership information such as: name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact<br />- Building name and address and location of the available space within the building<br />- Available square feet and expected rental rate, fully serviced<br />- Date of space availability<br />- Amount of parking available on-site and its cost.

The GOES mission includes making continuous measurements of the earth's surface and disseminating both data and analyzed environmental information to operational users.  The GOES and the POES spacecraft also carry Search and Rescue (SAR) transponders.</p>
<p>The POES program which includes the National Polar Partnership (NPP) the Joint POLAR Satellite System (JPSS) program provides operational coverage of the entire earth fourteen times each day.  This program is a principal source of environmental data for the portion of the globe that is not covered by conventional environmental data sources.  The POES mission makes measurements of temperature and humidity in the earth's atmosphere, surface temperature, cloud cover, water-ice boundaries and proton/electron flux near the earth. The JASON 2/3 satellite system altimetry mission provides sea surface heights for determining ocean circulation, climate change and sea-level rise.</p>
<p>The DMSP program provides operational coverage of the entire earth up to fourteen times a day providing nearly complete global coverage of clouds every six hours.  Each DMSP satellite monitors the atmospheric, oceanographic and solar-geophysical environment of the Earth. The space environmental sensors record along track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts.</p>
<p>This work requires skill in the technical aspects of electronic equipment maintenance.  The maintenance personnel must be capable of working on a wide variety of complex computer equipment and other digital equipment, while responding successfully to the competing priorities of Government technical and management personnel in less than optimal conditions.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541513 with a business size standard of $25.5 million. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.

<DESC>NAICS: 237990 <br />SIC: 1629 <br />Size Standard: $20M <br /><br />This synopsis is for the Jones Oyster Bed Island Dredge Material Containment Area (DMCA) Raising and Improvements, Savannah Harbor project. This acquisition is being offered as a competitive 8(a) Set Aside and will result in a Fixed Price Contract Award. The construction magnitude for this project ranges from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. <br /><br />Description of Work: This project includes raising the front perimeter dike of the Jones Oysterbed Island Dredge Material Containment Area (DMCA) approximately two feet; with the option to construct a bird island. The front dike, which parallels the Savannah River from north-west to south-east, is estimated to be 24,930 feet in length. Approximately 300,000 cubic yards of borrow material from the interior of the DMCA will be required for the raising. The borrow material consists of dredge spoils from the Savannah River. The dike construction will be performed to the inside of the existing dike crest and slope, except in areas where the existing dike has washed away due to erosion. Approximately 500 to 1000 linear feet of shoreline will be protected from river erosion by using a stone revetment. The project will include an option to construct one eight-acre bird island with a perimeter moat and containment dike to allow water to permanently surround the island. An equipment access and landing site shall be necessary since the island may only be accessed by water. A dike access ramp from the landing site will be included in the project. Additional project requirements include clearing, grassing, and erosion control provisions. <br /><br />Evaluation Criteria: The Government will utilize a Best Value Trade-Off Methodology in rendering the best value decision for award of this contract. Only that Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value will be awarded the contract. The evaluation factors and their relative importance for this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />Non-cost Factors: <br />Factor 1: Past Performance - This factor is more important than FACTOR 2 <br />Factor 2: Corporate Relevant Specialized Experience - This factor is less important than FACTOR 1 <br /><br />Price: All non-cost factors, when combined, are more important than Price. <br /><br />Award will be made to the Offeror whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of criteria requested which offers the best overall value to the Government. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror. <br /><br />NOTE: This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only and is anticipated to be available approximately 02 April 2014.

<DESC>The Fresenius Dialysis System installed in the VA Pacific Islands Healthcare System is a proprietary Fresenius USA Inc. ("Fresenius") system. The local Fresenius group is responsible for the maintenance, testing, service and software upgrades for our system.

FAR 8.405-6 (a)(B)authorizes the contracting officer to order from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem: "Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized"

When the decision was made to acquire Fresenius software for use in our dialysis system which only works with proprietary Fresenius software, this became a Fresenius only requirement. While there are a number of vendors without Fresenius software updates the existing equipment and software is not compatible. It is the very definition of one capable source for the services needed.
