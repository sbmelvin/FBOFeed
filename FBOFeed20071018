<SUBJECT>65 -- Advanced Development of Recombinant Influenza Virus Vaccines
<SOLNBR>DHHS-BARDA-07-06

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. Continuous outbreaks of human disease caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses from infected birds have occurred since late 2003 in Asia, Europe and/or Africa. Ongoing influenza surveillance reveals that H5N1 viruses are endemic in bird populations and suggests that continued human exposure is likely. As a result, the threat of a pandemic caused by highly pathogenic influenza viruses continues.
	
The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. DHHS has undertaken a portfolio matrix approach to modernize and diversify influenza vaccines and to expand domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing surge capacity. Specific measures were implemented that support advanced development of cell-based influenza vaccines and antigen-optimization approaches for pandemic influenza vaccines, stockpiling of pre-pandemic influenza vaccines and building of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing infrastructure.  
	  
	DHHS now seeks to leverage recombinant-based technologies to decrease the timeline of vaccine production in response to a newly emerged pandemic influenza strain. The timeline for the availability of egg- and cell-based inactivated pandemic influenza vaccines in the U.S. is estimated at 20-23 weeks post-pandemic onset, which may be towards the end of a first pandemic wave. Recombinant-based influenza vaccines, which may not be dependent on pandemic influenza virus reference strain availability and the production and calibration of potency assay reagents needed for inactivated influenza vaccines, may be available 8 to 12 weeks post-pandemic onset. The effect of vaccination combined with influenza antiviral drugs and community mitigation measures may delay the peak incidence of pandemic influenza disease and reduce mortality and morbidity during a severe pandemic.        
           
The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, contemplates single or multiple contract awards to develop recombinant influenza vaccines based on hemagglutinin genes or proteins (plasmid DNA, virus-vectors, peptides, subunit proteins and virus-like particles) and leading towards FDA-licensure and human usage. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds include clinical investigation lot manufacturing, scale-up process development, clinical evaluation, validation of manufacturing process systems and manufacturing facility concept design but not facility construction. 

Contracts will be awarded to vaccine manufacturers that have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. or have partnerships with companies owning vaccine manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Other requirements for offerors include the following: (1) a completed final report of Phase I clinical trials for safety, immunogenicity and cross-reactivity or cross-neutralization of antigenically drifted influenza strains using a recombinant influenza  vaccine (2) written evidence of firm commitment to establish and maintain the necessary facilities in the U.S. to manufacture bulk and final container recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine with a manufacturing surge capacity of 50 million doses within six months, (3) a manufacturing production cycle that  permits recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine lot release within 12 weeks of a pandemic declaration. (4) a comprehensive development plan and timeline for U.S licensure of a recombinant pandemic-like influenza vaccine.
               
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate the final stage development leading towards FDA-licensure of new influenza vaccines in U.S. based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be  three to five years or 36 - 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-BARDA-07-06 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about September 14, 2007. Proposals will be due a minimum of 45 days after RFP issuance.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP-DHHS-BARDA-07-06, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of March 2008.

<DESC>NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation Headquarters (HQ SACT) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of contracting support for the development of a study on information system infrastructures between NATO and Non-NATO Actors in an unclassified environment.

HQ SACT is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. HQ SACT intends to use the sealed bid procedure involving possible pre-award discussions. Partial bidding is not allowed.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for this project is IFIB-ACT-SACT-07-14 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

HQ SACT is seeking contractor support for the development of a study on possible information system (IS) infrastructures by which NATO can interact with non-NATO actors both in times of peace, periods of emerging tension, and during conflict operations. This study will examine the current and planned NATO unclassified IS environment and recommend suitable applications and infrastructures with which NATO can interact with non-NATO actors, making a recommendation as to the benefits and shortfalls of each as well as a best overall recommendation. The non-NATO actors include but are not limited to the United Nations, European Union, Partnership for Peace, Red Cross, OXFAM, as well as local and national governments.

Firms that have performed similar contracts within the last three years similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation are eligible to apply.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for engineering and technical services for their Scientific Research and Development Squadron One (VXS-1) and their Military Support Division (MSD). Due to the complexity associated with the development of advanced technology weapon systems and the continual turn over of military personnel, NRL?s MSD and VXS-1 must augment their military/civil service staff with these specialized services.  This not only ensures project continuity but also provides highly qualified expertise with unique knowledge not normally found in fleet personnel.  The program and engineering services afford a single Point of Contact (POC) for the NRL MSD and VXS-1 managers to assure critical communications and information are maintained between program sponsors during the requirements identification phase and throughout the development, testing, and evaluation processes.  The technical services provide the expertise required for the performance of specialized design, fabrication, installation, operation, removal, and maintenance of one-of-a-kind research systems associated with VXS-1 airborne research laboratories.  Contractor services also used for NRL?s military contingent and to provide VXS-1 maintenance management assistance. The anticipated period of performance is a basic award of twelve months with four 12-month options, if exercised.  The anticipated level of effort is 17,680 each for the basic contract year and Option 1, year 2, if exercised, and 17,160 for each of the additional option years, if exercised.  The incumbent contractor is Eagle Systems Incorporated, at 22560 Epic Drive, California, MD  20619, Contract number N00173-03-C-2009. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided.  This is not a solicitation.  The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.
All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Linda Townsel, Contract Specialist, at the address and phone number listed below.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No telephone requests or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted.  DEPARTMENT  OF JUSTICE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION, Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subparts 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competition procedures is justified for this procurement action.  The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content).  The BOP, Office of Information Systems has a requirement for the annual maintenance renewal of 1,196 software licenses for the Stedman?s Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker Premium ASCII Edition Software, and the acquisition of 2,240 additional licenses.  The Medical Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker Software is utilized and incorporated with the BOP?s existing Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System.  The BOP requires the Stedman Pharmaceutical Software for use with the EMR system currently in use by the agency.  The software maintenance services licenses and additional new users include: all new software releases; system update; program temporary fixes (PTFs); documentation updates; and toll-free hot-line support twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance.  The estimated value of this acquisition is estimated at $55,734.64.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, it is determined that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  The BOP requires the renewal for software maintenance and acquisition of additional licenses for the Stedman Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software for the EMR system.  The software will be part of the current system.  In addition, the EMR system is a rights protected system, and the EMR software vendor utilizes the Stedman software as the spell-check feature on the pharmacy module.  The Stedman vendor, Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc., owns the proprietary rights for the Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and has not authorized this product to be offered for resale by other vendors.  Due to Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc.?s, owning the proprietary rights to the Stedman?s Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and that the product has not been authorized for resale by other vendors, no further efforts to obtain competition were made.  A review of the proposed price was completed by the Contracting Officer.  Based on the submittal from the vendor and a comparison of current and historical acquisition data for similar maintenance renewals and acquisitions of software licenses, it was determined that the quote was based on established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government.  The Contracting Officer has made the determination that proposed price is fair and reasonable.  In accordance with FAR 10.001, Market Research was conducted by both the requiring activity and the Contracting Officer.  It has been determined that to not maintain the spell-check software and maintenance service for this system would be detrimental to the BOP, as the pharmacy systems controls and directs the types and amounts of medication being dispensed to the inmates.  The BOP also requires additional licenses for deployment to the BOP medical offices, and to obtain software different from the current software would be detrimental to the overall operation of the BOP EMR system.  The BOP will continue to conduct market surveys and make efforts to obtain competition for future acquisitions.  Contracting Officer Certification-  I hereby certify that this request for Limited Source Justification is made in good faith, and that the supporting justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.   //s// Linda Townsel, Contract Specialist; National Acquisitions Section.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The 1st and 2nd battalions will each receive one of the  TEMF facilities. A TEMF building is accompanied by a Deployment Equipment Storage warehouse (DES) and a Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) shed. Each TEMF building will be 12,110 SF minimum and will be used to maintain most, if not all, wheeled battali on vehicles. This may range from staff car vehicles up to large over the road tractor trailers that carry other tracked vehicles and everything in between. There will be four maintenance bays that will accommodate any size vehicle for long term repairs whi le there is a dedicated bay to perform regularly scheduled maintenance such as lubes and oil changes etc.  Also within the TEMF facility, there will be storage of parts and tools as well as an administration area and NIPRNET and SIPRNET communications clos ets. In addition, there will be a CCI secure communications storage area and an AR190-11 spec weapons storage vault.  Each TEMF building is associated with a DES warehouse which is a standard warehouse type of building.

The POL building is essentially a large shed which will house all of the lubricants and solvents used by the mechanics in the maintenance of the vehicles in the TEMF buil ding.  (2) This project also includes the design and construction of the Supply Support Activity (SSA)/Medical Warehouse.  It is a standard warehouse type of building with slightly more secure areas for the storage of medical supplies and other items which  will require tighter climate and humidity controls than a standard warehouse would provide. There are associated Mechanical and Electrical spaces allotted for the climate and humidity controls. There is also office space for several staff personnel who wi ll maintain stricter monitoring of the warehouse contents.  (3) The 3rd part of this project is the design and construction of the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) maintenance hangar to service the unmanned aerial vehicles. This facility will also h ouse the Platoon HQ and will also have an FSR office and latrines with showers. There will be maintenance bays to handle up to four vehicles and a secure camera storage room in addition to large and small parts storage rooms. There is an additional break/t raining/mission briefing space which will be a multi purpose room for the repair personnel and the vehicle operators.  This project includes 23,580 SF of demolition.  This project shall be designed to meet the requirements to obtain a LEED Silver rating wi th all of the appropriate support documentation.  However; the project will not include submission to the USGBC for certification at this time.  The estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 2 November 2007.  Award will be on or about 14 March 2008.   Contract duration is estimated at 480 days. NAICS is 236220 with a size standard of $31,000,000.

This organization administers the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA), which guarantees the right to vote of Uniformed Services personnel and their dependents when absent from their voting residence, and all U.S. citizens when residing outside the United States. The Act is the most recent in a series of Congressional initiatives beginning in 1955 to expand the  scope of enfranchisement for U.S. citizen participation in elections for Federal offices. The FVAP also carries out the Department of Defense responsibilities under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the purpose of which is to promote voter regis tration and participation in the electoral process. The FVAP and its predecessor organizations have historically provided a wide range of services and information to promote and facilitate participation in the national voting process. The Get-Out-the-Vote Campaign is a program activity that has been performed since the early 1970s. The purpose of this campaign is to promote citizen participation in the political process by encouraging them to register and to vote. The initial focus of this effort was on the Uniformed Services and it was carried out in close coordination with the Mili tary Departments. The scope of the campaign has expanded over the past 25 years to reflect the broadening of absentee voter legislation. While the close working relationship with the Military Services has been maintained, the Program has also reached out t o engage State and local government election officials and organizations in keeping with the Congressional mandate of Federal, State and local cooperation. The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), The National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) and the International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials and Treasures (IACREOT), in particular, have been involved in the development and localization of campaign materials.  1.3 Objectives: This Performance Work Statement is for the acquisition of the services and products required by FVAP to field a successful and effective continuous campaign:  "	development of a campaign strategy and focus "	creation of multimedia advertising products to carry out the strategy "	dissemination of multimedia products to national media outlets "	monitoring and reporting the results of media placement efforts  1.4 Scope:  The contractor shall develop a public service campaign strategy to include a theme message, target audience definition and recommended media placement; create and produce appropriate multimedia products supporting the strategy; disseminate thes e products to national media outlets and use best efforts to encourage their use as Public Service Announcements (PSAs); and monitor and periodically report on the results of the dissemination effort.  1.5	Period of Performance:  The period of performance shall be for one (1) Base Year of 12 months and four (4) 12-month option years.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) seeks to identify potential small business sources that could function as the prime contractor for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) contract.  Interested parties are hereby requested to provide a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).
NAVAIR deployed its enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, Sigma, in October 2002 and has been in the operations and support (O&S) phase of the program since that time.  PMA 203 provides functional O&S support for the Sigma ERP deployed solution at NAVAIR under the guidance of a Government/integrator team.  O&S tasks are typically accomplished through integrated product or project teams, comprised of Government and contractor personnel, supporting business areas such as financial, procurement, human resources, and other elements of the NAVAIR Sigma solution. Sigma is scheduled to transition to Navy ERP in October 2007 with full retirement in December 2007.  As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, NAVAIR will establish a Business Office that will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise and provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters. 

This contract will provide support for continued O&S performance of the Sigma system, NAVAIR Navy ERP implementation efforts, and the establishment of the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The Government views these primary tasks as a three-phased approach of distinct yet interrelated efforts resulting in an overlap of one task area within the next.  Support areas required for each effort is outlined below:
	
	1) Sigma Operations and Support
The goal of this phase is to provide continued sustainment levels of operational support through close-out of the Sigma ERP system.  In performance of this phase, the contractor shall support NAVAIR business processes as deployed in Sigma, maintain data integrity of the system, identify and resolve any issues, and complete requirements for external mandates.  O&S will continue to be fully operational up until one month after Navy ERP Go-Live with a final Annual Close for FY07 conducted within the operational period.  In this phase, the contractor shall perform services in areas such as testing, configuration management, requirements management, functional support, analysis, and role management under the guidance of the government/integrator team.  Mandated system changes and deficiencies will require analysis, requirements and solution development, testing and implementation.  The contractor shall also support the Customer Support Center (CSC) which provides services to NAVAIR by providing communications and liaison between Sigma ERP and internal and external customers and organizations and by disseminating information regarding Sigma ERP via multiple venues.   The CSC also supports resolution of customer issues through its Help Desk and Role Management activities, updating of ERP website information, and compiling metrics to gauge.

2) NAVAIR Navy ERP Implementation
The goal of this phase is to serve as the focal point for successful Navy ERP Implementation at NAVAIR.  To achieve this goal, support shall be required for the transition from the Sigma ERP System to the Navy ERP system in the areas of change management, data management, test support, and training support across all SAP modules including  FI, FM, CO, MM, PS, SD, HR, WF, IM, AM and BW.  Implementation support is currently on-going and will continue through complete Sigma phase out which is projected to be three months after Navy ERP Go-Live. 

3) NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office
	As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, the primary NAVAIR interaction with Navy ERP regarding their deployed NAVAIR solution will be through the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The goal of the Business Office will be to serve as the NAVAIR center of excellence for Navy ERP business operations and functional process sustainment.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) seeks to identify potential small business sources that could function as the prime contractor for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) contract.  Interested parties are hereby requested to provide a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).
NAVAIR deployed its enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, Sigma, in October 2002 and has been in the operations and support (O&S) phase of the program since that time.  PMA 203 provides functional O&S support for the Sigma ERP deployed solution at NAVAIR under the guidance of a Government/integrator team.  O&S tasks are typically accomplished through integrated product or project teams, comprised of Government and contractor personnel, supporting business areas such as financial, procurement, human resources, and other elements of the NAVAIR Sigma solution. Sigma is scheduled to transition to Navy ERP in October 2007 with full retirement in December 2007.  As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, NAVAIR will establish a Business Office that will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise and provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters. 

This contract will provide support for continued O&S performance of the Sigma system, NAVAIR Navy ERP implementation efforts, and the establishment of the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The Government views these primary tasks as a three-phased approach of distinct yet interrelated efforts resulting in an overlap of one task area within the next.  Support areas required for each effort is outlined below:
	
	1) Sigma Operations and Support
The goal of this phase is to provide continued sustainment levels of operational support through close-out of the Sigma ERP system.  In performance of this phase, the contractor shall support NAVAIR business processes as deployed in Sigma, maintain data integrity of the system, identify and resolve any issues, and complete requirements for external mandates.  O&S will continue to be fully operational up until one month after Navy ERP Go-Live with a final Annual Close for FY07 conducted within the operational period.  In this phase, the contractor shall perform services in areas such as testing, configuration management, requirements management, functional support, analysis, and role management under the guidance of the government/integrator team.  Mandated system changes and deficiencies will require analysis, requirements and solution development, testing and implementation.  The contractor shall also support the Customer Support Center (CSC) which provides services to NAVAIR by providing communications and liaison between Sigma ERP and internal and external customers and organizations and by disseminating information regarding Sigma ERP via multiple venues.   The CSC also supports resolution of customer issues through its Help Desk and Role Management activities, updating of ERP website information, and compiling metrics to gauge.

2) NAVAIR Navy ERP Implementation
The goal of this phase is to serve as the focal point for successful Navy ERP Implementation at NAVAIR.  To achieve this goal, support shall be required for the transition from the Sigma ERP System to the Navy ERP system in the areas of change management, data management, test support, and training support across all SAP modules including  FI, FM, CO, MM, PS, SD, HR, WF, IM, AM and BW.  Implementation support is currently on-going and will continue through complete Sigma phase out which is projected to be three months after Navy ERP Go-Live. 

3) NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office
	As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, the primary NAVAIR interaction with Navy ERP regarding their deployed NAVAIR solution will be through the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The goal of the Business Office will be to serve as the NAVAIR center of excellence for Navy ERP business operations and functional process sustainment.  Additionally, the Business Office will minimize impact of Navy ERP deployment and implementation on current and new users.  The Business Office will provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters, ensure that business process and technical areas are in sync, and will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise.  All NAVAIR requirements for Navy ERP, to include deficiencies, will be processed and prioritized through this organization to represent the NAVAIR Process Owner needs.  The Business Office will be responsible for key stakeholder coordination, business and functional process management, deficiency identification, data management and reporting, user and role management, sustainment training management, customer advocacy, and liaison with the Navy ERP Program Management Office (PMO).  In addition, the Business Office will provide strategic recommendations to the NAVAIR leadership on the health, business operations, and recommendations for improvement based on the data obtained from the Navy ERP system.  The NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office will officially stand up at Navy ERP Go-Live which is projected for 1 October 2007 and remain in effect indefinitely.  The contractor shall support the following efforts: testing, quality assurance, training, data management, reporting, system deficiency recognition and resolution, requirements management, business Process Owner support and project management support.  The contractor shall also provide customer support for NAVAIR.

It is anticipated that there will be a total of three basic contracts awarded for each of the three FLETC locations outlined herein, for a total of nine awards.  The Government will utilize the procedures outlined in FAR Part 36, as supplemented, to competitively secure services of the most highly qualified firms.  Each contract will be a multi-discipline, indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity type contract where delivery orders will be placed on an intermittent, ?as required,? basis.    The delivery order proposal/award process is currently under development and will be detailed in a future announcement.  

As of this date, each contract will include a base contract period of one (1) year or $1,000,000.00 in fees, with the possibility of four (4) one-year option periods, or $1,000,000.00 in fees per option period, whichever occurs first.

<DESC>The purpose of amending this notice is to correct the due date and email address for submissions.

*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Influenza Plan (Nov. 1, 2005) designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness. Following the issuance of this plan, the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) was charged with gathering information, developing policies and issuing recommendations on specific medical countermeasures may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with an influenza pandemic in the U.S. The office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is responsible for the tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these countermeasures, including the establishment of a stockpile of supplies to prevent or control the spread of pandemic influenza disease. This is a Request for Information (RFI) about parties with the interest and capabilities to perform certain pre-clinical testing of vaccine components in the BARDA pandemic preparedness stockpile.  It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.


*** OBJECTIVE *** As part of its preparations, HHS/ASPR/BARDA has established a stockpile of avian influenza vaccine antigens to be administered in a pandemic or pre-pandemic situation for the prevention of avian influenza disease. In order to extend the number of effective doses that can be provided from the stockpile, BARDA is also working with manufacturers to develop antigen-sparing technologies such as components that can be added to the vaccine to enhance its immune response, known as adjuvants.  In the event of a pandemic emergency, HHS would like to be able to extend the available stockpile of antigens by administering them with adjuvants depending on availability.  In order to have this ability, BARDA, in conjunction with NIH, CDC, and the antigen and adjuvant manufacturers, is planning to conduct clinical testing of possible antigen:adjuvant combinations, the results of which would be submitted to U.S. regulatory agencies as support for an Emergency Use Authorization.  A prerequisite for performing these clinical studies is the completion of GLP general toxicology testing of the investigational vaccine formulations to enable the filing of an IND to FDA. To conduct this testing, BARDA seeks qualified contract research organizations having the necessary capabilities and willingness to perform the studies. This is a request for such organizations to make themselves known to BARDA and provide information concerning their capabilities to perform the studies.  Please provide information concerning the following required capabilities. 


1.	Designing and conducting standard GLP general toxicology safety testing in rabbits according to protocols and standards sufficient to support the filing of an IND for clinical testing in humans

a.	Protocol design and execution
b.	Housing of animals in accredited facilities, administration of vaccine, 
c.	Observation and recording of animal welfare 
d.	Collection of sera 
e.	Clinical chemistry and immunological testing of sera
f.	Euthanasia by approved methods 
g.	Post-mortem histopathological analysis of test subject tissues 

2.	Mixing ad hoc of two vaccine components just prior to immunization according to procedure to be provided 

3.	Compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations for housing and experimental testing with lab animals

4.	Capacity for up to 90 rabbits for the duration of the study

5.	Availability to start in Dec07-Jan08 timeframe


Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. 
All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law and will be eligible for additional special protections under the conditions of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. 
Information must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on Oct. 26, 2007. Include the name, email address and telephone number of a primary contact point at your organization for this RFI in the event that HHS has additional questions or requires clarification on the submitted information. Responses are limited to 2 pages.     
Your response to this RFI must be submitted electronically in .pdf format and emailed to schuyler.eldridge@hhs.gov.  The type of business submitting the response (i.e., small business, large business, hub-zone, small and disadvantaged business, etc.) must be identified in your response.     If the service can be acquired on a GSA schedule, VA schedule, or other Government-wide acquisition vehicle, please supply the contract title and number, contract point of contact information and the name of the awarding agency.

<DESC>This amendment serves to answer industry questions regarding this RFI, update the NAICS code for R&D, and extend the closing date from 29 Oct 07 to 30 Nov 07.  There is not a lot of technical detail but that is intentional. We do not want to lead any  of the responses down a preconceived path, as we are looking for innovative industry ideas and responses on potential technological solutions. Industry Questions and Technical Representatives' Answers: Question 1.	Helicopter APS Potential Threat Types and Their Vulnerabilities  Answer 1.  The primary threats we will consider are MANPADS (current generation and emerging) and RPGs, but we desire performance against other threats such as ATGMs and unguided rockets.  We are currently investigating the vulnerabilities of specific thre ats, but the lethal mechanism should cause the threat and all residual parts to miss the aircraft.  Question 2.	Detailed Engagement Scenario Answer 2.  Scenarios of interest include all situations in which helicopters or large slow fixed wing aircraft would be operating at a speed and altitude that would make them vulnerable to the threats above. Question 3.	Defeat Ranges and Keep Out Zones Answer 3.  This depends on the lethal mechanism and its effectiveness. Question 4.	Aircraft Constraints (Size, Weight, Power, Placement of APS) Answer 4.  The constraints are undefined at this point, but size and mass should be minimized. Question 5.	Sensor Clutter Environments Answer 5.  Sensor clutter environments should include all terrain and weather conditions encountered in operating environments. Question 6.	Is same solution required for both Fixed and Rotary? Answer 6.  All solutions and technologies will be assessed.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) seeks to identify potential small business sources that could function as the prime contractor for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) contract.  Interested parties are hereby requested to provide a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).
NAVAIR deployed its enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, Sigma, in October 2002 and has been in the operations and support (O&S) phase of the program since that time.  PMA 203 provides functional O&S support for the Sigma ERP deployed solution at NAVAIR under the guidance of a Government/integrator team.  O&S tasks are typically accomplished through integrated product or project teams, comprised of Government and contractor personnel, supporting business areas such as financial, procurement, human resources, and other elements of the NAVAIR Sigma solution. Sigma is scheduled to transition to Navy ERP in October 2007 with full retirement in December 2007.  As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, NAVAIR will establish a Business Office that will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise and provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters. 

This contract will provide support for continued O&S performance of the Sigma system, NAVAIR Navy ERP implementation efforts, and the establishment of the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The Government views these primary tasks as a three-phased approach of distinct yet interrelated efforts resulting in an overlap of one task area within the next.  Support areas required for each effort is outlined below:
	
	1) Sigma Operations and Support
The goal of this phase is to provide continued sustainment levels of operational support through close-out of the Sigma ERP system.  In performance of this phase, the contractor shall support NAVAIR business processes as deployed in Sigma, maintain data integrity of the system, identify and resolve any issues, and complete requirements for external mandates.  O&S will continue to be fully operational up until one month after Navy ERP Go-Live with a final Annual Close for FY07 conducted within the operational period.  In this phase, the contractor shall perform services in areas such as testing, configuration management, requirements management, functional support, analysis, and role management under the guidance of the government/integrator team.  Mandated system changes and deficiencies will require analysis, requirements and solution development, testing and implementation.  The contractor shall also support the Customer Support Center (CSC) which provides services to NAVAIR by providing communications and liaison between Sigma ERP and internal and external customers and organizations and by disseminating information regarding Sigma ERP via multiple venues.   The CSC also supports resolution of customer issues through its Help Desk and Role Management activities, updating of ERP website information, and compiling metrics to gauge.

2) NAVAIR Navy ERP Implementation
The goal of this phase is to serve as the focal point for successful Navy ERP Implementation at NAVAIR.  To achieve this goal, support shall be required for the transition from the Sigma ERP System to the Navy ERP system in the areas of change management, data management, test support, and training support across all SAP modules including  FI, FM, CO, MM, PS, SD, HR, WF, IM, AM and BW.  Implementation support is currently on-going and will continue through complete Sigma phase out which is projected to be three months after Navy ERP Go-Live. 

3) NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office
	As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, the primary NAVAIR interaction with Navy ERP regarding their deployed NAVAIR solution will be through the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The goal of the Business Office will be to serve as the NAVAIR center of excellence for Navy ERP business operations and functional process sustainment.  Additionally, the Business Office will minimize impact of Navy ERP deployment and implementation on current and new users.  The Business Office will provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters, ensure that business process and technical areas are in sync, and will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise.  All NAVAIR requirements for Navy ERP, to include deficiencies, will be processed and prioritized through this organization to represent the NAVAIR Process Owner needs.  The Business Office will be responsible for key stakeholder coordination, business and functional process management, deficiency identification, data management and reporting, user and role management, sustainment training management, customer advocacy, and liaison with the Navy ERP Program Management Office (PMO).  In addition, the Business Office will provide strategic recommendations to the NAVAIR leadership on the health, business operations, and recommendations for improvement based on the data obtained from the Navy ERP system.  The NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office will officially stand up at Navy ERP Go-Live which is projected for 1 October 2007 and remain in effect indefinitely.  The contractor shall support the following efforts: testing, quality assurance, training, data management, reporting, system deficiency recognition and resolution, requirements management, business Process Owner support and project management support.  The contractor shall also provide customer support for NAVAIR.
Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government.  The Government will not be responsible for SOC preparation costs.  Submissions should be electronically in a MS Office compatible format to yarinee.tafur@navy.mil.  Note that submissions will not be returned.  Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 27 Oct 2006.

<DESC>The EPA is looking for companies interested in providing design services and technical assistance in coordinating with a federally recognized Tribe, for the implementation of a statistically valid and culturally relevant consumption survey that will provide input into the evaluation of potential tribal health risk(s) associated with exposure to contamination at the Upper Columbia River site. Tribal resources have been contaminated by pollution in the Upper Columbia River (extending from the U.S./Canadian Border to the Grand Coulee Dam in Northeastern Washington State).  Specific dietary, as well as other resource uses/practices (behaviors) and the precise nature and extent of contamination have not been defined.  A survey instrument to measure current levels of dietary consumption and other uses/practices that may result in exposure to pollutants is necessary to assess potential risks to tribal members from such exposures.  The survey?s purpose is to define future data needs, including prioritizing the types and locations of resources for collection and contaminant analysis.  All tasks will be performed in coordination with the EPA and the tribe.  Specifically, expertise and assistance are required in:  accessing and using the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) software or its equivalent; survey design support, training interviewers, and analyzing data. It is anticipated that the contractor will participate in an Advisory Council, design a survey using the NDSR interview software, train interviewers, and conduct a pilot study during 2008.  The survey is anticipated to be implemented in 2009 and the data analysis will be completed by September 2010. Interested companies shall send 2 copies of their qualifications and experience in performing such activities to EPA Region 7, 901 N 5th Street, Kansas City, KS  66101, Attn:  Marie Noel.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

?	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
?	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree (B.Eng) from an accredited institution in Civil Engineering is desired at a minimum, Master?s Degree (MSCE) preferred.
?	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
?	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
?	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
?	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
?	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.

III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent?s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

CWI is seeking qualified small businesses (NAICS Code 562910-Environmental Remediation Services, 500 Employee Size Standard) with the knowledge, expertise, and resources to provide management and execution of design and build turnkey services for a remotely operated Liner Disassembly and Sorting Station.  The station will be used to disassemble waste packages, sort and separate the waste package contents consisting of remote handled (RH) low-level waste (LLW) and transuranic (TRU) waste contaminated with residual or bulk amounts of elemental sodium (Na) or sodium/potassium (NaK). The waste package disassembly and sorting process will be performed remotely in a shielded "hot" cell.   In addition to removing and sorting the waste, the liners shall be sized to fit into a 3-ft x 3-ft x 4-ft tall waste box liner for final disposition.  The conceptual design for opening and sizing the liners is to use a plasma torch and mechanical cutting tools.  The tools are located on the sizing table and will cut the liner(s) in both a linear and circumferential pattern.  Figures 1 through 4 provide conceptual drawings and renderings of the Liner Disassembly and Sorting Station.  
Considerable quantities of RH waste are stored at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site. In accordance with federal and state legal and regulatory requirements, this waste must be processed and repackaged in preparation for final disposition. Because capabilities to process RH waste do not currently exist at the INL Site, the Remote-handled Waste Disposition Project (RWDP) has been proposed to provide this capability. The mission of the RWDP is to open, segregate, characterize, treat, repackage, and ship for final disposition more than 900 waste liners containing RH waste.  A typical waste package weighs approximately 5,000 pounds and consists of up to three cylinders as shown in Figure 5.  The innermost cylinder is an 11.5-in. diameter by 72-in. long sheet metal assembly containing the RH waste.  The 11.5-in. assembly is located inside a 16-in. diameter by 12-ft 4-in. long carbon steel pipe, with either gravel or a concrete plug for shielding.  The 16-in. diameter pipe is positioned inside the outermost cylinder, a 24-in. diameter by 13-ft 8-in. carbon steel pipe.  Both carbon steel pipes have 1/4-in. thick walls.  In addition to the typical waste packages, small quantities of special case large-volume waste packages containing Na and NaK are also in the waste inventory.  Waste components that are sodium-contaminated may not be directly disposed of without removal of the sodium metal and/or NaK. Much of the sodium-contaminated waste is suspected to have limited (i.e., residual) quantities of sodium or NaK, while a few of the waste liners contain larger quantities of sodium or NaK. --- This is a sources sought announcement designed to identify and qualify potential sources interested in this project. This announcement is not a solicitation. Small businesses who submit a qualified response will be maintained on a list as sources for a possible future solicitation. It is anticipated that a request for proposal will be issued approximately Summer 2008.
Respondents' pre-qualification submittal packages shall include the following: 
1)	PROJECT EXPERIENCE:  a) List at least two similar projects that respondent has performed during the last five years.  The listed projects must be similar in scope and involve work of similar complexity as the work covered by this notice;  b) For each project listed provide i) client name, and the name, title, email and telephone number of the client point of contact, ii) dollar value, iii) description of respondent's scope, iv) contract type, dates of performance and for whom the work was performed.  The client point of contact must be able to address respondent?s performance.
2)	FINANCIAL CAPABILITY:  Provide respondent's Annual Report or current audited financial statement and current quarterly financial statement.  (Only one copy of the financial documents is required.)
3)	QUALITY PROGRAM:  Provide a copy of the table of contents of the respondent's Quality Assurance Program (QAP). The respondent must have an established NQA-1-2000 or newer quality assurance program.
4)	SUBTIERS:  If respondent will have subtier subcontractors, the scope that each subtier is proposed to perform must be identified and the applicable backup documentation identified in Items 1 through 3 above must be provided for each subtier.--- Submittal packages must be limited to 50 pages, however, financial documents are not required to be included in the page count.  For the sake of consistency, structure your submittal to match the order of the 4 submittal requirements as listed above and use standard 3 ring binders.***TELEHPONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED***  Questions may be sent by email to james.alberico@icp.doe.gov.  As solely determined by CWI, the omission or failure to correctly and satisfactorily respond to any pre-qualification criterion as required above may result in the respondent's elimination from further consideration.  
Interested Subcontractors shall submit four (4) hard copy submittal packages to:  
Jim Alberico, CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC, Idaho Cleanup Project, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID  83415-2503; if via overnight delivery, send to street address:  CFA 601, Scoville, ID  83415.  Submittals must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time on November 17, 2007

For Attachment 1, entitled, ?DRAFT ? Statement of Work (SOW)?.  
 
This is a FY 2008 action. The primary objective of the Government?s requirement will encompass focusing on expanding the use of electronic payment methods to collect federal tax payments and encouraging taxpayers to use electronic media to interact with the IRS.  The IRS is seeking to expand the electronic payments initiative through additional partnerships with private industry. To this end, the Government is interested in awarding contract/s that will increase the number of electronically filed balance due returns and other taxpayer forms and related payments.  We are looking for ways to build upon and expand this initiative to improve service for balance due filers who e-file and to attract others to the program.  Expansion shall include payment methods that do not require IRS to receive, process and store paper checks and money orders.  This may include, but is not limited to, the acceptance of electronic fund transfers, intermediary conversion of paper checks and money orders to electronic transactions, or credit card transactions.   The IRS has a requirement for a contractor to provide an electronic payment product that allows taxpayers to make federal tax payments through convenient, safe and secure means and to collect the appropriate service fees from the taxpayer to cover all costs incurred to deliver the services requested by the U.S. Government.  IRS further anticipates the award of a contract/s for a one year base period and four one-year option periods.  

The required services have been determined to meet the definition of commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief of 1997 (IRC 6311(d) (2), the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts to obtain services related to receiving payment by other means where cost beneficial to the Government.    The Secretary may not provide any fee or provide any other consideration under such contracts.  No U.S. Government appropriated or non-appropriated funds will be made available or utilized in performance of the resultant contracts.  The taxpayer will be responsible for paying the Contractor directly for services rendered.  
Potential offeror/s possessing the capability of providing these services are invited to submit, on a voluntary basis, in writing, sufficient information that demonstrates the ability to fulfill this requirement. Documentation submitted should include specific experience with and working knowledge of Electronic Payment Services.   Please Note:  page limitation is hereby limited to 3 pages exclusive of the completion of Attachment 2, Section 508 Standards and provisions.

All responses to this Request for Information (RFI) shall include Company Name and address, business size and type (1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUB Zone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or (8) large business), business and technical points of contact including e-mail addresses and telephone numbers.  Acknowledgement of your company?s registration in the Central Contracting Registration database www.ccr.gov is required.  

Any questions regarding this posting must be submitted in writing via email to the both points of contact as denoted herein on or before October 24, 2007 in order to allow answers to questions to be publicly posted before the required response date of 29 October 2007.  Please do not call the Contracting Office for information.  We hope to eliminate duplicate questions by posting any and all questions on the www.fbo.gov website.  Note: Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will ensure that any/all information received in response to this Request for Information (RFI) will be protected and treated the same as if it were Source Selection Sensitive Information.  However, if any questions contain proprietary information such information must be identified

Additional information or updates will be posted at the www.fbo.gov website.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this website regularly for any changes or updates.  Responses must be provided no later than October 29, 2007.  No extensions will be granted.           

This notice is to assist the Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and Office of Procurement in determining potential sources on a proposed Request for Proposals. This sources sought announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- REGIONAL HAZARDOUS MATERIAL/HAZARDOUS WAST MANAGEMENT - REQUEST FOR COMMENT
<DESC>The following is a Request for Comment (RFC).  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  The intent of this RFC is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on the draft Statement of Objectives (SOO).  The government will be receptive to any alterative recommendations, ideas and comments which would result in limiting unnecessarily constrained requirements (currently practiced in the government), realizing cost savings, while highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas easily resolved by adopting industry?s best practices.  All comments, issues or concerns received identifying potential problems areas, proposing alternative solutions or recommendations which would enhance this initiative may be considered for feasibility and implementation accordingly.  Receipt of comments should not be construed as vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed buy as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  The Government is seeking a single award.  Comments are solicited regarding the following:

1. Innovative approaches to meet the requirements of the SOO delivering performance that meet or exceed the performance of the separate, individual, as-is systems presently in place.  Approach should be documented and outlined in a manner that is similar to a Performance Work Statement of which portions may be included in an eventual solicitation.

2. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost/pricing information for the suggested/documented approach.

3. Suggestions on the use of unique commercial industry provisions/clauses as well as contract type.

4. Suggestions on performance metrics and quality assurance/quality surveillance systems.    

Innovative approaches to implement alternative system(s) which meets the criteria in the SOO, as well as complies with all U.S. Government regulations will be evaluated and considered for inclusion into the eventual solicitation package.  The use of comments received from industry to complete final SOO and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of the contracting activity.

Subsequent solicitations will be synopsized prior to release.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  The Government will not critique a potential offeror?s comments and the RFC should not be used by offerors to market their products/services.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of this RFC.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.  Response to this synopsis must be submitted in writing to Aster Lyon, Code 245I at the above listed address no later than 16 November 2007.

<SUBJECT>A -- RNAi - Request for Information
<DESC>This announcement is to request information and comments from industry concerning the National Institutes of Health (NIH) plan to facilitate the use of RNAi technologies in the Intramural laboratories on the NIH Campus.  RNAi technologies are an exciting and rapidly evolving technique to determine the functions of genes and transcripts.

NIH will establish a Trans-NIH effort to facilitate both moderate (RNAi reagents targeting 10s to 100s of genes) and high throughput screens that ultimately target entire genomes.

The NIH intramural program seeks to facilitate NIH-wide utilization of RNAi technologies.  This effort should support moderate- and high-throughput use.  Information for either, or both, is requested.

NIH is seeking firms/suppliers who will enter into pricing arrangements with the NIH to support this research.  

Moderate throughput:

Moderate throughput work (single tube to 96-well format) will take place as a traditional bench-top activity in individual labs.  Uniform pricing and a mechanism for technical support of individual groups within the NIH is planned.  Purchase units for both transfection and stable integration of human and mouse cells should be sufficient for triplicate experiments for each target gene,  siRNAs, shRNAs, and other potential novel reagents are of interest.  Pricing for individual target genes and plates is planned. Transfection reagent pricing is also planned.

High-throughput:

The NIH intramural program will be exploring full genome screens of both mouse and human RNAi reagents.  The difficulty of scale-up, including equipment and trained personnel, are recognized.  NIH intramural labs with demonstrated experience in HTS will move towards implementation of full genome screening through pilot work, where the merits of different types of reagents will be explored, prior to commitment to any particular reagent(s).  Information on pricing of reagents is planned.  Pilot work may require close contact between NIH researchers and the firm/supplier research and development staff. 

Scope:

NIH seeks to: 1) develop a list of firms/suppliers to provide reagents and high throughput screens; 2) negotiate the most favorable pricing to support the NIH researchers; 3) develop ordering procedures with firms/suppliers; and, 4) provide technical support to the NIH researchers as needed.


Pre-Solicitation Meeting:

A pre-solicitation will be held in the Natcher Building on the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland on December 17, 2007.  

Please see the Web Site for the information and registration for the RNAi Meeting at http://www3.niddk.nih.gov/fund/other/rnai2007/

In advance of this meeting interested parties are requested to submit written questions that will be addressed by the NIH researchers at this meeting.  A transcript of the meeting will be prepared and will be made available to the public. 

Please note:  All meeting proceedings, questions and answers (excluding proprietary information) will be posted at the RNAi Meeting Web site.

Please address all inquiries about meeting logistics to:

<SUBJECT>R -- Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Sets Collection and Management
<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action Synopsis:  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to incorporate an additional two (2) years and seven (7) months of Optional performance periods to its contract with the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This action is subject to the availability of funds.  CMS intents to extend the unique services of NCQA to assist CMS in the collection and management of the annual Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) data submission for Medicare Advantage managed care organizations.  CMS also requires the Contractor's specialized capabilities in the development and testing of new quality of care performance measures for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.  Since January 1997, Medicare managed care organizations (MCOs) have been required to annually report performance measures from the HEDIS. HEDIS is a widely used set of health plan performance measures employed by both private and public health care purchasers to promote accountability and to assess the quality of care provided by managed care organizations. Originally designed for private employers' needs as purchasers of healthcare, HEDIS has been adapted for use by public purchasers, government compliance monitors, and managed care consumers. HEDIS is developed and maintained by NCQA with input from other health care stakeholders, providers/practitioners, managed care organizations, consumers and federal government health agencies.     
  
CMS collects a subset of the HEDIS measure set annually.     It is critical to CMS's mission that we continue to collect and disseminate information that will help beneficiaries choose among health plans (consumer information); information that contributes to better health care through the identification of quality improvement opportunities (quality assurance); and provides for proper oversight and management of the Medicare Program (program oversight).  CMS's working relationship with NCQA contributes significantly to the attainment of these goals.  CMS requires an experienced contractor to provide and maintain an information system and IT infrastructure to collect and support submission of HEDIS measures data for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and generate a database on Medicare plans. In addition to providing MA plans with data submission tools and instructions with detailed technical specifications for submitting HEDIS measures, the contractor must facilitate and provide technical support and assistance to individual Medicare Advantage plans as they submit data according to Medicare requirements.     

The addition of these option periods will make the contract's period of performance a total of five (5) years.  The estimated total value of the additional option periods is $728,420.00.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to incorporate additional option periods into the current contract with NCQA and should not be considered a request for proposals nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement that will be considered by the agency.  The statement must demonstrate that the firm(s) has the capability to perform the required work.  All capability statements must be submitted via email to Aileene Mitchell Ford at: aileene.mitchellford@cms.hhs.gov on or before November 8, 2007 by 2:00 p.m.  Voice communications will not be entertained. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  CMS will not reimburse costs for submission of capability information.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD) provides DCHA/OTI with an advanced level of support, ensuring that the Office is able to meet its mandate of providing fast and flexible transition assistance programming.  The Division provides overall operations support, human resources support, and management resources for a 95% program-funded staff in Washington and the field, and 100% program funded activities in the field.  There are currently approximately 90 OTI staff in Washington headquarters and the field supporting nine transition programs in Sudan, Somalia, Liberia, West Bank/Gaza, Nepal, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, including a new country program in Lebanon.  Within the OMD, the Operations Support Team (OMD/OST) provides general administration support, budget and finance services, procurement planning, information technology, information management, field start-up/management/close-out services, and records management support.  The Personnel Services Team (OMD/PST) includes human resources support in the areas of workforce planning, recruitment, contracting, retention programs, training, travel support, and all other general personnel services for a majority program-funded workforce.  OMD supports the OTI mission by providing centralized control of funds and resources to facilitate accountability and a response capability for rapid program-funded transitional activities overseas.  The Division also maintains and develops administrative policy and procedures as it relates to DCHA/OTI programs.   The Division also provides advice and assistance on the design, implementation and evaluation of management systems and on the application of Federal, Agency and office policies on all aspects of OTI's management and operations: security, human resources, workforce planning, contracting and procurement, budgeting, financial management, organizational structure, records management,  facilities and property management, office and residential buildings operations, training, and information technologies.


INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Chief, Operations and Management Division (OMD), to oversight and manage OTI's worldwide Operations and Management functions in support of transition assistance programming. The Chief of OMD will be based in Washington, DC, is a member of the Office's Senior Leadership Team (SLT), and will report to the Deputy Director of DCHA/OTI or his/her designee.  The Division is comprised of at least 20 USPSC and institutional contractor personnel, and is divided into two teams, an Operations Support team, and a Personnel Support team.  The majority of the workload, at least 70%, is to provide direct oversight and ensure operational support for OTI's worldwide program implementation.  Approximately 30% of the workload encompasses strategic design, budget planning, and financial controls.

The Chief of OMD is a senior-level position requiring experience in supervisory management, operations support in the international crisis and transitional development field, and program management. The individual must have an in-depth knowledge of transition work overseas, and a keen understanding of the requisite support required for both Washington and the Field.  Knowledge of relevant policies and procedures, experience in country program operational set-up and close-out, and experience in managing human and financial resources are essential.  The individual is expected to make decisions or recommendations that ensure the ongoing operational capacity of transition work overseas, and in some cases, this may mean working toward changing key Agency or office policies. The key qualifications for this position are experience in the areas cited above, together with demonstrated experience in utilizing creativity, excellent communications and analytical skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority while exercising sound judgment.  The individual performs under general administrative discretion, with wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The sensitive nature of the work, the importance of good presentation skills, the ability to maintain staff morale in a transitioning work environment and the need to work closely with other OTI management divisions and other USAID management, procurement, and other administrative offices demands excellent skills of social interaction, quick judgment, and negotiation.  The work is of outstanding difficulty, as the individual must posses a broad range of abilities in the area of operations management, and also have a keen understanding of political transition programming in order to ensure the operational effectiveness of OTI programs.  

The individual must have the presence, knowledge, leadership, interpersonal and organizational skills to manage individuals and teams, and advocate and articulate OTI's mission to all levels of USAID, other USG agencies, and other government and non-governmental individuals and groups.  While the individual must be able to make decisions independently, s/he must also be able to manage decisions as leader of a Division comprised of two teams.  The incumbent is a seasoned professional who must be able to operate with little or no guidance and with the knowledge and experience to effectively use the authority and responsibility that comes with the position.  The Chief of OMD must have the presence to assess operations needs and respond with on-the-spot decisions, initiatives or actions.  

A sound knowledge of USAID's operational processes in Washington is also vital to the position. The incumbent must be articulate and able to represent OTI and explain transition programming and the requisite operational support required in various forums, meetings and seminars. 

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Chief that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of this position.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to award on a sole source basis to Office Movers Inc. for refrigerated trailers to move nitrate film

Statement of Work 


The Library of Congress MBRS Division rented refrigerated trailers for the purpose of temporarily storing the John E. Allen nitrate film collection until it could be recanned and shelved in the vaults at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The commencement of the recanning operation was delayed for several months resulting in the need to rent the trailers for a longer period than initially anticipated. Additionally, the resultant loss of staff as part of the closing of the Dayton facilities has caused further delay. 
Trailers continue on site at Wright-Patterson AFB, area B while the recanning project progresses. Refueling of the tanks for the refrigeration units is scheduled for every Monday, Wednesday & Friday. Offloading of film from the trailers by forklift  is done on a regular basis, as scheduled by LC staff on site from the film vault corridor as follows:

Period of performance: from April 2 to June 1, 2008 (9 weeks)

The contractor shall be responsible for all spillage from containers during the pull or haul process.

The term pickup means the same as pulls, hauls, or dumps.

The contractor shall make pickups as scheduled and shall furnish and install contractor-owned containers and equipment both the FCI and FSL locations.

Pickup schedule will include both regular scheduled days and will-call pickups as needed.  In general, the scheduled pickups will occur Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at the FCI and on Thursday at the FSL. For security purposes, pickups shall occur at 5:00am. Contractors are hereby notified that they must arrive to the institution at least 30 minutes prior to pickup time for compactors located within the secured perimeter of either facility. The pickup schedule is subject to change based on the needs of the Government. If a scheduled pickup falls on a Federal holiday, the pickup must be made the first business day following the regularly scheduled day and time. When necessary, pickups in addition to the regular scheduled will be requested on a will-call basis. Pickups will be made in  agreement with the will-call request or within 24 hours of the will-call. 

Equipment Requirements- Equipment to be furnished shall include four 32-cubic yard roll-on, roll-off  hydraulic, securable compactors.

Containers must be suitable for cold weather operations and must be leak proof and suitable for wet garbage. All equipment, supplies, hydraulic fluid, compactor containers, and controls will be supplied by the contractor. Three compactors will be located at various sites and the fourth compactor will be the revolving compactor.  Once a sealed full compactor is removed for disposal, the revolving compactor will be put in its place.

Security- Contractor is subject to full compliance with institution regulations and policy while engaged in the trash removal process. The contractors equipment and vehicles shall keep the driveways and entrances serving the premises clear and passable by institution and emergency vehicles at all times. All automotive type vehicles or other mechanized or motorized equipment when parked and unattended shall be turned off, locked, or disabled.

All incoming and outgoing vehicles will be searched by a BOP employee.  Institution officers must be able to inspect the entire vehicle to determine contraband is not introduced into institution and to prevent escapes. The BOP will inventory all tools upon entry and exit of the institution. 

Due to the nature of the correctional setting, delays in performance of work may be expected.  Such delays may include but are not limited to inclement weather, electrical or mechanical problems, or other security matters. When the contractor reports to the institution on a scheduled pickup but is unable to perform services due to such delays, the contractor will be paid for their time in the form of a pre-determined trip fee.  The unperformed pickup may be rescheduled at the BOPs discretion or may be performed on the next regularly scheduled pickup. Charges for trip fees should be represented as separate line item charges on each invoice.

<SUBJECT>R -- DSCA DIILS Translation Services
<SOLNBR>HQ0013-07-T-0003
<RESPDATE>082107
<CONTACT>Janet Szatmary, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-601-3728, Fax null, Email Janet.Szatmary@dsca.mil
<DESC>1. The purpose of this Amendment is to provide a listing of the questions submitted to DSCA Contracting in response to solicitation HQ0013-07-T-0003 along with their responses.  

Question 1: Wanted to confirm that the use of a government credit card is optional for purchases under $3000.00. 

Answer 1: Paragraph 8.a. of the solicitation states: "Calls that fall under the Government Purchase Card (GPC) limit (currently $3,000), may be paid using a DIILS GPC as long as the contractor accepts credit card payments." 

Question 2: Does the monthly invoice only refer to unpaid work?

Answer 2: IAW FAR13.303-3(a)(6)(i), the summary invoice is to include "all deliveries made during a billing period, identifying the delivery tickets covered therein, stating their total dollar value, and supported by receipt copies of the delivery tickets".  "All deliveries" includes both paid and unpaid deliveries for the billing period in question.

Question 3: For the PowerPoint slides, you ask that we include the English text in a text box in the lower right hand corner.  At least one of the slides has a great deal of text that would make including both languages on one slide a bit difficult without some serious re-design of the slide.  My question is, do you have any specific guidelines for how the English text should appear, or should we use our own discretion?  
It will be difficult to format the translated slides to appear identical to the English slides if we have to also include the English text.  

Answer 3: The English is put in a 12-14 point font to enable it to fit.  If there is a slide where everything will not fit, an abbreviated English portion can be used.  Main purpose of this is to allow the English speaker to be assured of what slide he is speaking about,

Question 4: ?The PowerPoint slides should have the English words in a text box to the lower right of the slide that match the translated words." Please elaborate on this requirement. In order to preserve the formatting, should the English words be included in the notes section below the slide or on the actual slide? If on the actual slide, how much of the English text should be provided (for example, just the title, the title and key words, or all of the text)? Would completely ?bilingual? slides (line-by-line) be acceptable?

Answer 4:  The purpose of English translation on the slide is so that the speaker can be assured of the contents that have been translated; therefore preference is not to put in notes section.  Participants is seminars often want to learn more English, so having the English on the slide helps the audience as well.  Side by side slides might be acceptable.  DIILS would have to base that decision on the product that comes out of such work.  We have used the requirement for English to be available in a textbox in a smaller font successfully for a number of years. 

Question 5: Will a list of preferred or previously used terminology or reference documents be provided? If so, will the information be provided as hardcopies or electronic files? Will translation memories be available?

Answer 5:  DIILS can provide previous translations, but we do not have a glossary of terminology that has been translated.
 
Question 6: Will a secured FTP site be required as a possible means of transmitting documents?

Answer 6:  No, our Internet security does not allow downloads from ftp sites.

Question 7: Will this contract be awarded to only one company or several? 

Answer 7:  It is the Government's intention to select a single awardee. The awardee will be selected in accordance with the source selection criteria noted in 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) of the Clauses section. 

Question 8: Will we have to provide price quotes after award of the BPA? 

Answer 8:  In accordance with the source selection criteria noted in 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) of the Clauses section, 
Price is one of the 3 evaluation factors that will be evaluated for award. Pricing should be included with Technical Proposal. The pricing should be submitted in accordance with the CLIN structure identified under Paragraph 9. Note the number was omitted but the applicable section (between paragraphs 8. and 10.) begin with "The contract line items are: CLIN 0001 AA-BC/ FFP ? per word translated for the languages identified."
 
Question 9: Will we only receive fully editable and unlocked MS Word and Power Point documents? 

Answer 9:  As noted under Paragraph 2, "Occasional translation from hard copy documents may be required, but in most cases materials are available in Word or PowerPoint electronically." Please also see Question/Answer 11 below.

Question 10: Is there a possibility that we will receive different types of documents besides MS Word and PowerPoint? 

Answer 10:  Yes, there is always this possibility.

Question 11: Are the samples provided representative of the type of formatting that will be required? 

Answer 11: Yes.
 
Question 12: What approximate yearly volume (in number of English Words) do you expect for this contract?  

Answer 12: Based on past year, an estimate would be 300,000 words.  However, please keep in mind this is only an estimate.  Needs fluctuate year to year depending on program demand. 

Question 13: Are there any languages that are particularly high volume or is the work spread fairly evenly throughout all the languages listed in the solicitation? 

Answer 13:  Spanish, French, Arabic, and Russian are most requested.

Question 14: Is it possible to receive separate High Resolution copies of the graphics used in the documents during the execution of the contract?  For example, there is a cartoon in the first page of the Power Point slide that has to be Photo shopped so that the translated version will match the original.  It will look much better if we have high-resolution files rather than converting them from embedded Power Point pictures.  

Answer 14:  Items that are in jpegs do not need to be translated.  The speaker would refer to the illustration and an interpreter would explain anything that needs to be explained.  

Question 15:  ?Solicitation HQ0013-07-T-0003 is a 100% set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business." Our company is only Veteran-Owned. Does this mean that only service-disabled veteran-owned businesses may apply? If so, may companies that do not meet this requirement still participate as subcontractors or partners of these companies?

Answer 15: Yes, this requirement is set-aside for award to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). Therefore, you must be a SDVOSB to be considered for award.  Yes, companies may participate as subcontractors or partners of these companies as long as they are adhering to the Policy of the Small Business Administration for "Limitation of Subcontracting" (see CFR 125.6).

Question 16:  What word counts are anticipated for the documents to be translated? If a current estimate is not available, what has been the volume in previous years?

 Answer 16:  See Answer 12 above.

Question 17:  "Translations will accurately reflect...any regional dialects/differences in a country?s language.? For which regions should the samples be translated for Spanish & French? For example, French from France, Africa, Canada, or the Caribbean; and Spanish from Spain, Mexico, Argentina, Cuba, Central or South America, OR the Caribbean? 

Answer 17: Translation delivery orders state the language and the country that the translation is for.  For the purpose of the translation, Spanish will be for South America and French for Africa.

Question 18: Could you please clarify which dialects will be needed for the following languages on your list:  Arabic, Armenian (Eastern or Western), French, Mongolian (Chahar or Khalkha), Portuguese, and Spanish.

Answer 18:
Arabic - Iraqi

Armenian - Eastern

French - West Africa

Mongolian - Chahar

Portuguese - Mozambican

Spanish - South America - Argentina

Question 19: In which dialects should the sample translations be submitted?

Answer 19: The samples should be French - Africa (to be more specific West Africa)
and Spanish - South American (Argentina)

Question 20: Please provide the estimated amount of documents (pages) that will need to be translated in the course of this contract.

Answer 20:  An estimated number of words is 300,000 (see also Answers 12 and 16 above).  Number of pages is difficult to determine, as the page can be full of words or just have a few words on it (such as on a PowerPoint slide).

Question 21:  The two files to be translated and submitted as samples were provided in PDF format. Is it possible to obtain these files in the original MS Word & PowerPoint formats, or to at least obtain the graphics for the PowerPoint document?

Answer 21:  Requests for sample documents in their original format should be submitted by email to janet.szatmary@dsca.mil.   

Question 22: Can you please provide me with estimated labor hours for this contract?

Answer 22:  The applicable pricing structure for this effort is $ per word. This is not a time and material/labor hour contract. Therefore, the requested information is not applicable nor is it available. Please refer to Questions/Answers 12, 16, and 20 above.

Question 23:  Is this a follow-on? If this opportunity is a recompete, could you provide high-level information on the incumbent contract (contractor's name, contract number, award date, estimated max value)?

Answer 23: This is a follow-on effort. The current contract vehicle is a Blanket Purchase Agreement, awarded by GSA, to Language Connections.  Award date was 03 October 2002.

2. The Closing Date and Time for this solicitation, to include submission of Past Performance Questionnaires, is hereby extended to 11 AM 21 August 2007. 

3. All other terms and conditions set forth in the combined synopsis/solicitation remain unchanged and in full effect.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled 'Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
