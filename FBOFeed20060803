<CONTACT>JOHN MACHEN PURCHASING AGENT 7036487391     jmachen@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Florida Integrated Science Center, Miami, FL, has a requirement for a 15' by 8' stainless steel, Diamondback airboat with a 454 GM Marine engine and a CH 3 2 3 to 1 reduction unit w/Black Hawk Belt, in order to access and service existing and potential future marine habitat stations within the Everglades and conservation areas throughout South Florida.  The USGS Ft. Lauderdale and Orlando offices already own airboats manufactured by Diamondback, which have a proven record of durability and reliability with USGS scientists.  Purchasing this additional craft from the same manufacturer will keep navigation skills/requirements consistent with the training skills/requirements of drivers using the current fleet.  In addition, the stainless steel hull of the Diamondback boat is especially resistant to hull punctures, which meets USGS safety requirements standards.  The aforementioned factors, plus the fact that maintenance and repair service requirements of the make and model are consistent with the current fleet, will not require the use of additional, multiple vendors for obtaining these services.   THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The anticipated award date is August 11, 2006, under the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.00.  NAICS is 336612.  No additional synopsis will be published.  Pre-Solicitation Announcement 06ER60-NoSolicitation will be available at the following website: www.ideasec.nbc.gov <http://www.ideasec.nbc.gov>. If you have difficulties accessing the solicitation using the website, call the National Business Center Electronic Commerce Help Desk at 703-390-6633.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), University Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15240, has a requirement for a non-invasive, diagnosis aiding monitoring system that records all relevant hemodynamic parameters, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, blood pressure, total peripheral resistance (TPRI), baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRRS) and vagal and sympathetic tone.  These parameters must be recorded in real time and displayed both as signals and numeric values using the following methods: Continuous (beat-to-beat) blood pressure measurement Impedance cardiography (for SV and CO measurement) High resolution 6-channel-ECG display Oscillometric blood pressure measurement This enables not only an assessment of the cardiovascular system, but also an evaluation of its regulation through the brain. Thus, important functions of the autonomic nervous system - sympathetic and vagal tone - can be determined. This can be used for the assessment of syncope as well as for adjusting pacemakers or for cardiovascular risk stratification. Other fields of application are the management of hypertension, assessment of diabetic neuropathies, or the evaluation of new drugs and vasoactive substances. Requirements: •&#61472;Non-invasive and online measurement of all important hemodynamic parameters with no discomfort for the patient •High resolution 6-channel ECG display (sampling rate 1000 Hz) to guarantee an exact R-R detection. •&#61472;Non-invasive beat-to-beat measurement of the blood pressure on the finger with the “Vascular Unloading Technique”. The absolute values of blood pressure are recorded on a large artery (a. brachialis) with an oscillometric blood pressure device. These values are used to continuously calibrate the beat-to-beat blood pressure values. The derived beat-to-beat values correlate closely with true intra-arterial blood pressure. •&#61472;Non-invasive and online measurement of stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance with impedance cardiography – continuously for every heart beat. •&#61472;Online recording of heart rate variability and blood pressure variability (HRV, BPV) for an evaluation of the autonomic nervous system and present the results in a 2 or 3-dimensional spectra graphic. •&#61472;Online recording of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity. •&#61472;Possibility of intervention marks, statistical evaluation of each measurement •&#61472;Automatic calculation of trends of hemodynamic parameters, “sliding power spectra“ for the assessment of heart rate and blood pressure variability and of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (sequence method). •&#61472;Saving of the raw data in the standardized "File Exchange Format" (FEF). The file can be loaded at any time in the future for a retrospective off-line analysis of the recorded session •&#61472;Facility to export all data into a MS-Excel® file or text file •&#61472;High reproducibility for an optimized observation of the patient after therapeutic interventions •&#61472;2 additional analogue channels: possible recording of external biosignals.

<DESC>The third annual Air Force Material Command TATTOO “Heritage to Horizons” celebrates the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force and commemorates US Air and Space Power.  The TATTOO will be hosted by the Air Force Materiel Command Commander on Friday, June 29, 2007 in conjunction with the annual WPAFB July 4th Fireworks Celebration at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.  The TATTOO is an outdoor ceremony that includes music by the Air Force Band of Flight, aircraft flyover’s, military ceremonies and is open to the public.  The evening will conclude with a traditional July 4th fireworks show.  Our recent 2006 TATTOO was an exciting event and huge success with over 60,000 guests in attendance. 

The term Military Tattoo dates from the eighteenth century when the British Army was fighting in the Low Countries.  Drummers from the garrison were sent out into the towns each evening to inform the soldiers that it was time to return to barracks. The process was known as Doe den tap toe and encouraged the inn keepers to "turn off the taps", stop serving beer and send the soldiers home for the night. The drummers continued to play until the curfew.  Over the years, the process became more of a show and often included the playing of the first post and the last post.  Bands and displays were included and shows were often conducted by floodlight or searchlight. Tattoos were commonplace in the late 1800’s with most military and garrison towns putting on some kind of show or entertainment during the summer months. 

	We would like to extend the opportunity for your company or organization to be a part of the celebration as a sponsor of the 2007 event.  Our professional staff is committed to helping your company achieve your marketing goals and receive the maximum return on your investment. Please don’t hesitate to call me with any comments or questions about the TATTOO/July 4th Celebration and your participation in it.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

<DESC>In 2007, The United States Air Force will celebrate its 60th year of Air & Space Power and the USAF Marathon is looking forward to celebrating this momentous occasion.  The USAF Marathon is held at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio and is open to the public.  The marathon has built a remarkable reputation for its outstanding closed course, organization, exposition, post-race festival and customer service.  In 2005 we were awarded the official status as the only sanctioned marathon in the U.S. Air Force making it an important, high profile event with senior leadership involvement.  With that in mind, the USAF Marathon staff strives to develop and expand the event and to anticipate the needs of our participants, sponsors and community.  This year our goal is to expand all of the events surrounding the marathon to give our sponsors the highest featured visibility throughout the marathon. 

	Our runners represent all 50 states and more than 8 foreign countries with a total of about 10,000 people attending the post-race festival and two day Sport’s & Fitness Expo. This gives our sponsors a unique opportunity to connect with a large and global market.  The 2007 marathon will be on Saturday, September 15 with a two day Sports & Fitness Exposition on September 13-14, Gourmet Pasta Dinner on the eve of the race and a Post-Race Festival at the finish line. 

	Currently we’re seeking sponsors to participate in the many different events that are all part of the USAF Marathon. The USAF Marathon offers various levels of sponsorship including category exclusivity, signage, sampling opportunities, two day expo, gourmet pasta dinner, post-race festival, race-course hospitality stations and logo opportunities.

	Our professional staff is committed to helping your company achieve the maximum return on your investment. I would love the opportunity to speak with you and discuss some of your marketing goals, budgets and plans.  We can discuss ways in which the USAF Marathon can meet your company’s strategies.  Please don’t hesitate to call me with any comments or questions about the USAF Marathon and/or your participation in it.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a contract to Continental Controls and Design, Inc. of  Huntington Beach, California through solicitation no. 9TZ06JAL002 on behalf of the Department of Army's  Battle Command Battle Lab at Fort Huachuca, Arizona  85613 pursuant to the authority of FAR Parts 12 and 13.501(a) “Sole Source Acquisitions”.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations document (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 20005-11 effective July 5, 2006.   The applicable NAICS Code is 336411 - Aircraft Manufacturing. NOTE: Section 508 does not apply to this requirement.   There is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Continental Controls and Design, Inc. is the manufacturer and sole authorized distributor of the Locust Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) and the Locust MAV Ground Control Station (GCS).  A justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  The Government requires multiple airframe interoperability.  The Continental Controls Locust MAV can operate 4 vehicles at once with one ground control station.  The limitation to 4 systems is due to the current state of the art in video downlink.  Data link capability allows for 10 systems in the air at one time. The Government requires high-speed cursor on target data interface. The Locust MAV GCS is compliant with the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Cursor On Target interface. Both User Datagram Protocol ( UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) / Internet Protocol (IP) protocols are registered with a system identifier “LOCUST” through the MITRE organization.  The Government requires payload swap capability.   The Locust MAV airframe is not a built up airframe.  It is an expanded polypropylene core that is milled out to provide equipment bays for various  Commercial Off the Shelf  (COTS) units.  This allows the same airframe to be adapted to new COTS units with no redesign of flight control systems or flight required hardware (motor / power train, elevon control, etc.).  The Government requires endurance extension.  The Locust MAV airframe can be extended from 18 inches to 36 inches using plug in wing extensions.  This effectively doubles the endurance capability of the base unit. The avionics package (autopilot) has to be as small as possible and use as little electricity as possible.  The Tiny Guidance Engine (TGE) from Continental Controls is the smallest available autopilot on the market.  Continental Controls and Design’s TGE  is the only unit small enough and capable enough to be used on the Locust MAV.   In addition, the avionics package (consisting of hardware and software) for Locust is used in conjunction with the ground control station software to allow command and control of the airplane.   Requirements: Provide the following equipment on a Firm Fixed Price Contract: Six (6) each  Locust MAV’s  and three (3) each Locust MAV GCS.  A single Locust MAV shall contain the following major components: 1) Airframe including power train and elevon control.  2) TGE Autopilot and GPS.  3) 900MHz RF Communication Datalink.  4) 2.4GHz Video Downlink.  A single Locust MAV Ground Control Station shall contain the following major components: 1) ITronix Duo-Touch Rugged Tablet PC (including power cable and stylus).  2) GCS Control Board.  3) 900MHz RF Communication Datalink.  4)  Video Receiver and High Gain Antenna.  5) Analog Video to USB Converter.  6) GCS Case.  Please provide delivery timeframes in your proposal.   Place of delivery and acceptance is: Fort Huachuca, AZ 85613. FOB destination. Solicitation provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items (January 2006) is hereby incorporated by reference.

AFRL Rome Research Site is developing a Collapsible Interactive DataWall (CIDW) with touch screen interaction to support collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center to develop interactive display technology.  The CIDW will require no sensor material be placed on the display screen surface and the mounting system must be compatible with the CIDW screen frame to which it will be integrated.  Substitution of the CIDW is unacceptable due to the negative impact on the research both in terms of cost and schedule.  Justification is based on SMART Technologies Corp. as the sole developer of the SMART Custom Touch System. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received (quote with product specifications) will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 334119.

Anncy Keeler can be reached at 734-439-1511 ext 3372.  Section K–(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov . In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of  contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.   The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional readonly provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive,  Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 ,  Tel. 703-872-8600  Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.  All Offerors  must acknowledgment all amendments if any.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The Spanish Ministry of Defense intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on works related to developing a Public Access Network (PAN) for processing and storing NATO RESTRICTED (NR) and NATO UNCLASSIFIED (NU) information as well as allowing access to the public internet.

The main purpose of the project is to standardize and upgrade different Public Access (PA) LANs throughout the Allied Command Europe (ACE), in order to create an ACE-wide consistent baseline in the NR/NU domain space. The main project objective will be to extend the Automated Command and Control Information Systems (ACCIS) Core Capability to the Management Information Systems (MIS) Bi-Strategic (Bi-SC) PA domain (Project 2001/51S03024) at Life Cycle Cost (LCC)-Land Madrid, Spain.

In order to achieve these objectives, the project will provide the equipment and works to support the implementation of a NR/NU LAN in the CC-Land HQ Madrid and NATO CIS Services Agency (NCSA) Sector Madrid. This will require the provision of equipment and works included in the following general categories:

- 2.1 Desktop workstations, laptops, and peripheral equipment;
- 2.2 Networking hardware and local cable and wiring support;
- 2.3 Servers to support, firewall, DBMS, EMS, anti-virus, storage, and WINDOWS 2003 infrastructure services;
- 2.4 Hardware/software to support security service requirements;
- 2.5 Contract support to install the system and, if necessary, to perform system transition works that may be required.

Project 2001/51S03024 is to be implemented by various host nations where the different ACE headquarters and facilities are located. Hence Spain is serving as the Host Nation for the part of the project falling under the scope of CC-LAND HQ Madrid and NCSA Sector Madrid, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The specific Host Nation body responsible for the implementation management is the Spanish NSIP Project Joint Office (NSIP PJO).

The estimated value of this project is 2.1 million EUR ($2.6 million USD).

The reference that will be used to identify the documents related to this project is ESP/NPJO/2001/51S03024-0/ICB-1. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-SPAIN-2006-ESP-NPJO-2001-51S03024-0-ICB-1.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Project 51S03024 intends to provide CC-Land HQ Madrid with a LAN infrastructure that makes possible to process and store NATO UNCLASSIFIED information as well as the required connectivity to the public internet. This network is referred to as the Public Access Network (PAN).

The infrastructure to be implemented under this project will be integrated by the following items and subsystems:

- A number of user workstations, laptops (for mobile users), and peripherals (black and white and color printers and scanners) for the Public Access Network (PAN) users;
- A server subnet. The servers in this subnet will provide the required services for the PAN user community: infrastructure services as well as mail, print, fax, file, database, http, antivirus, and EMS services;
- An entry-level storage area network;
- A security subsystem to protect the entire PAN network infrastructure (firewall);
- A subnet that will allow a secure and controlled access to the Internet for internal users (Web browsing and SMTP relay);
- A subnet to provide limited connectivity for limited access users;
- The required networking infrastructure for interconnecting all the elements described above;

The following is a summary of the pieces of equipment and services included in the project for the implementation of the Public Area Network (PAN) in the CC-Land HQ Madrid:

- General Purpose Server: 11
- Firewall (High Performance Server): 1
- Workstation (High Performance): 1
- Workstation (Standard): 194
- Laptop: 40
- Printer (Local): 43
- Printer (Network BW Small): 27
- Printer (Network COL Laser): 20
- Scanner: 30
- SAN System: 1
- Large IP Switch: 2
- Medium IP Switch: 18
- Medium Router: 1
- Cabling and Racks: N/A
- Software: SAN and Network Management Software
- Services to be provided: Installation, Documentation, Training, and Contract Services Support

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Personnel working on this project, or visiting installations and/or working at NATO sites, are required to have a NATO SECRET security clearance. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to DAT the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract. 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 28 July 2006

2. Anticipated date that Spain will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: September 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: November 2006

4. Anticipated contract award date: November 2006

<DESC>The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) in anticipation of an award of contract(s) to acquire U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body (defined below) approved contraceptive implant along with the insertion device to USAID.  The base quantity is 72,000 sets.
  
A stringent regulatory authority (SRA) is a drug regulatory body that closely resembles FDA in standards utilized in its operations. Currently, countries that participate in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) are considered to have stringent regulatory authorities. The ICH regulatory bodies include: the U.S. FDA; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare; the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) centralized procedure; and the European Free Trade Area (represented by the Swiss Medic). The Canadian drug regulatory authority, the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada, is an observer to the ICH and is also considered a stringent regulatory authority. Other countries may be considered to have a stringent regulatory body if they have implemented ICH guidelines and resemble the U.S. FDA in operation, but would be considered by USAID on a case-by-case basis. 

The implants supplied to USAID under this contract shall have the expiration dating approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body of 60 months (5 years).  

The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract(s) resulting from this solicitation.
 
The Offeror must supply the following documentation to USAID:
(1)       Complete product description,   
(2)	evidence that the implants offered in response to this solicitation are manufactured in an ISO 9000 approved facility, 
(3)	evidence that the product and production/manufacturing facility have been approved by U.S. FDA or other stringent regulatory body, 
(4)	evidence that the product shelf life approved by U.S. FDA or stringent regulatory body is 5 years, 
(5)	long term stability data, 
(6)	any data to support that the product does not require climate controlled transport and storage, and
(7)	documented proof of any current registrations and in-process registrations.

Products purchased under this contract are for developing countries for use in family planning programs supported by USAID and in a full range of service delivery programs.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract is 935.

Performance under the basic contract shall be from the award date on the face of the contract through December 31, 2007. Four additional option years of performance will be from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011.

The RFP is expected to be issued on or about late March 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration.  The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is issuing this request for information (RFI) in support of the C/KC-130T Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  This RFI is a follow-up posting to the original notice under N00019-06-R-0040 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code number 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with the size standard in number of employees at 750. 

The Navy is looking to upgrade the avionics subsystems for the USMC KC-130T and Navy C-130T aircraft.  The desired modernization solution will be accomplished by replacing aging, unreliable equipment and adding additional equipment necessary to meet Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The end solution will reduce parts obsolescence and maintenance work and reduce aircrew size while providing  increased situational awareness to the aircrew.  The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate existing aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.  

Attached are draft documents of Section B, Contract Line Item Numbers and Section C (SOO, CDRLs, and SRD).  Interested parties should submit their written comments and questions no later than 18 August 2006 to Mary Ann Foran, MaryAnn.Foran@navy.mil Angela Tennyson, Angela.Tennyson@navy.mil.  These comments will be addressed during an Industry Day to be held tentatively on 30 August 2006 in Lexington Park, MD.  More information will be forthcoming on specifics for the Industry Day in a later posting.

This is not a request for proposal.  It should not be construed as a commitment or a guarantee of any kind by the US Navy that it will issue a solicitation. The US Navy does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI) and all information shall be made available at no cost to the government.  If any response(s) is (are) received, acknowledgement of receipt will not be made nor will evaluation of any information provided be given at this time. Any information provided to the US Navy in response to this RFI will become US Navy property and will not be returned.  All proprietary information will be treated appropriately.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), intends to award a sole source cost type contract to Computer Science Corporation, 4045 Hancock Street, San Diego, CA for the continued efforts to provide GEOSAT Follow-On (GFO) satellite Calibration/Validation (Cal/Val) support which includes assessment of on-orbit performance, conduct of payload calibration and data validation and facilitate the resolution of performance anomalies.  GFO is a one-of-a-kind polar-orbiting satellite that provides highly accurate measurements of the topography of the ocean surface from which tactically significant features such as ocean fronts and eddies, wave heights, internal acoustic structure, and sea-ice edges are derived.  CSC has a unique understanding of the full end-to-end system, from the satellite and its specialized payloads, through the downlink and ground support systems. In light of this unique skill set, CSC is the only responsible source capable of performing the required services that helps maintain GFO in a maximum operational state. The Government intends to award, on a sole source basis, a 5 year contract for the described products. This contract will consist of one base year and four option years. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All responses received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses to this notice of intent to award to CSC should be submitted to Kimberly Reidy, Contracting Officer, Code 02-22H, Building OT4, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, 4301 Pacific Hwy., San Diego, CA 92110- 3127.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate a contract with Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on a sole source basis for logistical and technical support for the Institute’s Division of Intramural Research (DIR).  The DIR, NINDS has operated several of its labs including the Laboratory of Neurobiology and Laboratory of Neurochemistry at an outside marine laboratory on a part-time basis over the last 18 years.  A five-year continuation of this program beginning May 2007 is anticipated.  The program will support important research in neural cells and neural cell membranes, neuronal signaling, and short and long-term memory mechanisms.  It is based on the need in the NINDS, DIR for live squid and other marine invertebrates to investigate the cellular function underlining central nervous system function.  MBL will provide a science based working environment at a marine facility with capabilities to collect and hold the Atlantic squid, Loligo Peallii, and other marine invertebrates.  Support will include technical services in the areas of mariculture, biochemistry, and computer programming.  Logistical support will be required in the areas of squid collection, shop services, photo and graphics, and laboratory space.  MBL has the prerequisite skilled personnel, technical experience, resources and facilities necessary for continued performance of this acquisition.  MBL is considered to be the only responsible source for this work pursuant to 41 USC 253c(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Organizations that believe that they can provide these services should submit their capabilities currently in place to the Contracting Officer at the above address within 45 days from the date of this announcement. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in obtaining this support make competition of this requirement not feasible.  This is not a formal solicitation or an announcement for a Request for Proposals (RFP).  See Note 22 and Note 26.

                                  NOTICE OF INTENT TO LEASE SPACE
                     USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
                                         FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA

The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to Sheltair Aviation Center.   The extension will be for 11,310 rentable square feet, (consisting of 9,600 square feet of hangar space with the remainder being shop space) fully serviced space for a term of twelve months.

The government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a new lease can be awarded.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government’s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  Any written comments are to be received within 14 days of the publication of this notice.

Reponses are due by the close of business August 18, 2006

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) intends to acquire services for the visual survey of Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) host trees using tree climbers, and bucket trucks, if required, within the State of New York.  These services will cover the infestation in Manhattan, NY.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Mimosa, Hackberry, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Visual surveys using tree climbers and bucket trucks to perform the inspections are a vital component to the success of the ALB Eradication Program.  USDA is looking to accomplish two goals through these survey contracts:  1) Detect all ALB infested trees in order to eliminate the infestation as quickly as possible and 2)  Confirm eradication by accomplishing repeated negative surveys on all ALB host trees within the targeted areas.  The contiguous survey area in Manhattan, New York, is approximately 7 square miles and contains both publicly accessible and limited access trees.  The publicly accessible trees are those trees located along streets, boulevards, highways, railroad right-of-ways, wetlands, bogs, and marshes as well as those in parklands, industrial parks, wood lots, housing developments, cemeteries, etc.  Limited access trees include all host trees located in alleys, courtyards, front yards, backyards, and on terraces and rooftops, etc.  There are an estimated 7,842 publicly accessible trees (1,897 less than 8” DBH, 3,369 between 8” and 16”, and 2,576 are 17” or greater) and 7,817 limited access trees (4,409 less than 8” DBH, 1,844 between 8” and 16”, and 1,564 are 17” or greater) in the survey area.  The survey of publicly accessible trees will include both tree climbing and bucket truck services and will be in the form of a firm fixed price, completion type contract.  The inspection of limited access trees will include both tree climbing and bucket truck services and will be in the form of a time and material type contract.  The contracts are anticipated to last for 12 months beginning September 1, 2006 (or date of award) through August 31, 2007 with unilateral options up to four years to extend the effective period.  The government may elect to award a single contract or to award multiple contracts for the same services to two or more sources under this solicitation.   The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $6.0 million dollar average receipts.  To be eligible for contract award, the offeror must be registered in CCR.  Register via the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting CCR Customer Service Contact Information at 1-888-2272423.

The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 423930; size standard 100 employees.

2.   The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.  Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1 and the attached CLIN structure.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.

3.   FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a best value, single award acquisition. The Government intends to award one contract to the offeror deemed responsible in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose proposal conforms to the RFP’s requirements and are judged to represent the lowest price, technically acceptable responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation. While the Government and the Contracting Officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with an offeror (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms for price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them necessary.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable procedures.    Offers shall propose on both CLIN 0001 and 0002 on the price schedule.  The Government may or may not award CLIN 0002.  Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the and will be ineligible for award.  

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:   By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract.  The offeror shall self certify that  they are capable of conforming to and meeting all the requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to include completetion of the contract not later than 25 SEP 06.  All offeror’s that meet these requirements will be determined technically acceptable.  Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements or failure to self certify will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:  Only price offers submitted by offerors whose technical offers are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation.  Award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable, responsible offeror. Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in FAR 15.404-1(b) to determine price reasonableness.  Note:  Prospective offerors need to take into consideration when providing a quote for this effort the value of all the scrap metal and material that will be recovered.  The attached pricing schedule includes CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002.  Each Offeror shall provide an offer for both CLINS or there proposal will be rejected.  When ranking prices the Government will consider the lowest price offeror as the offeror that provides the lowest overall cost when combining the total cost of CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002 only if the Government decides to award both CLINS.  If the Government decides to award only CLIN 0001 then the evaluation of lowest price will be based on CLIN 0001 ONLY.  Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.    

5.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     
6.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offer is determined not to be technically acceptable.       The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.     Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.     The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Innovative Interfaces, Emeryville, CA. to provide several programs to customize our library database system.  The contractor will develop a 1) linking program, which will enable library users searching a database (ex. PubMed) to link from the article citation directly to the article.  They are required to sign in only once to USUHS remote computer services for the entire search session.  Linking from article will save time and reduce traffic on the servers; 2) coverage data service subscription program which will enable USUHS to track its current subscription to fourteen different journal collections.  Publishers and providers are constantly adding, dropping and changing titles without notification which has required a great deal of staff time to discover and correct these changes to the journal collections.  The coverage data service subscription program will solve this problem; and 3) software program which will enable all USUHS staff to understand the terms of the licenses, track changes and problems, automatically get usage statistics and keep a history for future reference of what was purchased, what was not and why, all in one location.  The period of performance will be for one year.  The statutory authority permitting this award under other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as cited in FAR 6.302-1(a) that authorizes USUHS to award contracts when only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add another site visit and to address questions as follows:

1.	A second site visit will take place 10 June 2004 at 0900 at 6500 B Street, Suite 101 Beale AFB, CA.  Please send the names, no greater than three, of the personnel wishing to attend this site visit via e-mail to nikole.may@beale.af.mil.
 
2.	Questions and Answers:

a.	Question:  The SOW provided indicates in paragraph 2.1 that “This includes location and replacement of end of line devices for those circuits with class B configuration.” While paragraph 4.8 implies that the system must be class A.  To our knowledge, the existing system is not class A and to make it such would require virtually complete replacement of the existing system.  If that is the intent, then there is not enough information (floor plans, building construction details etc.) to assess the cost involved.

Answer:  Paragraph 4.8 of the Statement of Work is now replaced with the following verbiage: “Provide new addressable monitor and control modules to connect to the existing approximately 22 Class A initiating device circuits (IDCs), up to 24 Class B IDCs, up to 12 Class B notification appliance circuits (NACs), and up to 4 supervised air handler shutdown circuits.  New modules to be installed in the existing Monaco enclosure.”

b.	Question:  There is no mention in the SOW the “new” portion of the system installed or being installed by another contractor.  Since it is in the same building, it is unclear if there is any responsibility under this SOW for this part of the system.

Answer:  The contractor will be responsible for their own work to include programming and installation.

c.	Question:  If the intent of the SOW is repair of the existing system in its current configuration, there is no way to assess the cost involved without a significant amount of technical data indicating the extent of the existing system including device types, locations and quantities, wiring configuration, conduit layout, air handler location and quantity, and other such details required to determine the cost involved.

Answer:  The purpose of the site visit is to gather information and assess system configuration details not provided in the Statement of Work.

LOGISTICS TENETS APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:

CONTRACT REPAIR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (CREP)

EARLY INDUCTION:
(a)     The Government will forward a list of projections of total contractor overhaul inductions and the number of high-priority overhaul inductions out of this total for each ELIN on this contract every three months.  This projection list will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO).  The first projection list will be forwarded within 14 days after award of this contract.
(b)     This list of projections by ELIN is provided for planning purposes and may result in a contractor’s decision to induct the high-priority overhaul induction projections quantities and non high-priority overhaul projections quantities at the risk of the Contractor, in order to meet the 2-day delivery schedule for high-priority order quantities and the 30-day delivery schedule for the non high-priority delivery order quantities.
(c)      The Government shall issue delivery orders that indicate both the high-priority quantities and non high-priority quantities.  The Contractor will only be paid for the quantities placed on order.
(d)      The Contractor will not be held to the 2-day delivery schedule for high-priority or the 30-day delivery schedule for non high-priority delivery ordering quantities that exceed the aggregate 6 month overhaul induction projections for either the high-priority or non high-priority categories, respectively, during the three-month period after the Government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections.  For ordering quantities that exceed such quarterly projections, a 60 day delivery schedule will apply.

CONSOLIDATED REPARABLE INVENTORY (CRI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Reparable Inventory (CRI) at the Contractor’s facility.    The Contractor shall act as the CRI to store reparable items shipped directly from designated Field Units, an Air Logistics Center (ALC) or from another Contractor’s facility.
(b)     The Consolidated Reparable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the listed yearly quantities for each and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each.  Disposition instructions for items in excess of the maximum level shall be provided by the PMS or Contracting Officer.
(c)      Induction of an item for overhaul from the CRI shall be contingent on the availability of reps in the CRI in conjunction with the early induction provision, which allows the contractor to induct at their own risk.
(d)     Upon completion of the contract, disposition instructions for items remaining in the CRI shall be provided by the Contracting Officer.

CONSOLIDATED SERVICEABLE INVENTORY (CSI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Serviceable Inventory (CSI) at the Contractor’s facility.   The contractor shall store completed serviceable items and ship them directly to a designated user at a Field Unit, Air Logistics Center (ALC), or other Contractor facility based upon a prioritized demand.
(b)     The CSI of end items shall begin when the overhaul of an item is completed and the item has been inspected and accepted.   For each completed overhaul (unless other shipment instructions have been provided) a WAWF electronic DD Form 250 shall be signed off and the item(s) shall be shipped in place to the Contractor’s Consolidated Serviceable Inventory c/o the Secure Air Force Government Bond Room at the Contractor’s Facility.
(c)      The Consolidated Serviceable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the yearly quantities listed on Appendix “A” Exhibits for each ELIN, and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each. Notwithstanding the CSI level, induction of an item for overhaul will be contingent on the availability of a funded order, a reparable, and a negotiated delivery schedule.
(d)     At the end of the contract ordering period, the government commits to issuing a “Final Reconciliation Delivery Order” to buy back the overhauled valves remaining in the CSI when the ordering period expires.  (This ordering period shall include the option periods, if exercised.)  Since a reconciliation of excess quantities projected by the government (but not actually ordered) will be a continual process covered during the quarterly reviews, the quantity to be purchased by the government at the end of the contract shall be limited to the quantity projected by the government during the 12 months preceeding the end of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor will be requested to provide information on the total quantity remaining in the CSI.  The government will compare this data to it’s own documentation.  Any disagreement that results will either be negotiated or handled under the “Disputes Clause”, at the government’s option.  The quantities on the final reconciliation order shall be deemed as a governmental bona fide need.  The final reconciliation delivery order will require the contractor’s input within 10 (ten) calendar days after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor shall provide the final count of the total quantity remaining in the CSI that fell within the government’s projections during the preceeding 6 month period of performance.  The final reconciliation delivery order will be issued thereafter and shall be the only delivery order issued after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  This process is expected to be complete 60 days after receipt of the final count from the contractor.  Delivery of the units ordered by the final reconciliation order shall be required within 30 days after receipt of the delivery order unless other terms are negotiated and so stated in the delivery order.


DELIVERY SCHEDULE:
*High Priority Delivery Schedule will be effective 90 days after effective date of contract. High Priority Reparables:  2 days after receipt of order up to the quarterly overhaul projections.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.
Low Priority Reparables:  Request the delivery schedule to be 92 EA, 30 days from either ELIN, or a combination of both ELINs, after receipt of order until completion of order.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.

*Quantities that exceed the aggregate quarterly overhaul induction projections during the 3 month period after the government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections will require a 45 day delivery schedule.

INITIAL PRODUCTION EVALUATION (IPE)
*An IPE (Initial Production Evaluation) will be required on all new sources, as well as sources who have not performed the overhaul in the previous 60 months.  The contractor will have 30 days to prepare for the IPE.  (If an IPE is not required, the contractor will have 30 days to begin production in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.)  The reparables used in the IPE will be applied to the quantity from the first delivery order.  Upon Government IPE acceptance, the contractor will have another 30 days to begin production, on the first delivery order only, in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.

ROB BACK
The contractor is authorized to “Rob-back” subassemblies or parts for installation on another end item to meet delivery requirements.

MISCELLANEOUS  
All serviceables will be shipped from the contractor to the user by utilizing fast transportation methods.

Shipping instructions will be provided to the contractor by phone, fax, e-mail, or other electronic means via the Production Manager.

A copy of all electronic Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) DD-250’s will be sent to the PMS within 2 days of shipment.

A Quarterly Production Management Review (PMRT) will be required at the contractors facility.  The Government requests that this be not separately priced and included in the quoted prices for the actual overhaul services.

A Preaward Survey is required if the apparent successful offer is not a previously proven overhaul service supplier for both NSN’s. 

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, the proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation will identify the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) in the planned solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested parties may identify to the contracting officer, their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS CLAUSE SHALL APPLY.  NO OBLIGATION MAY BE INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL FUNDS AVAILABILITY HAS BEEN CERTIFIED.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The Spanish Ministry of Defense intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on works related to developing a Public Access Network (PAN) for processing and storing NATO RESTRICTED (NR) and NATO UNCLASSIFIED (NU) information as well as allowing access to the public internet.

The main purpose of the project is to standardize and upgrade different Public Access (PA) LANs throughout the Allied Command Europe (ACE), in order to create an ACE-wide consistent baseline in the NR/NU domain space. The main project objective will be to extend the Automated Command and Control Information Systems (ACCIS) Core Capability to the Management Information Systems (MIS) Bi-Strategic (Bi-SC) PA domain (Project 2001/51S03024) at Life Cycle Cost (LCC)-Land Madrid, Spain.

In order to achieve these objectives, the project will provide the equipment and works to support the implementation of a NR/NU LAN in the CC-Land HQ Madrid and NATO CIS Services Agency (NCSA) Sector Madrid. This will require the provision of equipment and works included in the following general categories:

- 2.1 Desktop workstations, laptops, and peripheral equipment;
- 2.2 Networking hardware and local cable and wiring support;
- 2.3 Servers to support, firewall, DBMS, EMS, anti-virus, storage, and WINDOWS 2003 infrastructure services;
- 2.4 Hardware/software to support security service requirements;
- 2.5 Contract support to install the system and, if necessary, to perform system transition works that may be required.

Project 2001/51S03024 is to be implemented by various host nations where the different ACE headquarters and facilities are located. Hence Spain is serving as the Host Nation for the part of the project falling under the scope of CC-LAND HQ Madrid and NCSA Sector Madrid, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The specific Host Nation body responsible for the implementation management is the Spanish NSIP Project Joint Office (NSIP PJO).

The estimated value of this project is 2.1 million EUR ($2.6 million USD).

The reference that will be used to identify the documents related to this project is ESP/NPJO/2001/51S03024-0/ICB-1. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-SPAIN-2006-ESP-NPJO-2001-51S03024-0-ICB-1.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Project 51S03024 intends to provide CC-Land HQ Madrid with a LAN infrastructure that makes possible to process and store NATO UNCLASSIFIED information as well as the required connectivity to the public internet. This network is referred to as the Public Access Network (PAN).

The infrastructure to be implemented under this project will be integrated by the following items and subsystems:

- A number of user workstations, laptops (for mobile users), and peripherals (black and white and color printers and scanners) for the Public Access Network (PAN) users;
- A server subnet. The servers in this subnet will provide the required services for the PAN user community: infrastructure services as well as mail, print, fax, file, database, http, antivirus, and EMS services;
- An entry-level storage area network;
- A security subsystem to protect the entire PAN network infrastructure (firewall);
- A subnet that will allow a secure and controlled access to the Internet for internal users (Web browsing and SMTP relay);
- A subnet to provide limited connectivity for limited access users;
- The required networking infrastructure for interconnecting all the elements described above;

The following is a summary of the pieces of equipment and services included in the project for the implementation of the Public Area Network (PAN) in the CC-Land HQ Madrid:

- General Purpose Server: 11
- Firewall (High Performance Server): 1
- Workstation (High Performance): 1
- Workstation (Standard): 194
- Laptop: 40
- Printer (Local): 43
- Printer (Network BW Small): 27
- Printer (Network COL Laser): 20
- Scanner: 30
- SAN System: 1
- Large IP Switch: 2
- Medium IP Switch: 18
- Medium Router: 1
- Cabling and Racks: N/A
- Software: SAN and Network Management Software
- Services to be provided: Installation, Documentation, Training, and Contract Services Support

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Personnel working on this project, or visiting installations and/or working at NATO sites, are required to have a NATO SECRET security clearance. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to DAT the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract. 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 30 August 2006

2. Anticipated date that Spain will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: September 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: November 2006

4. Anticipated contract award date: November 2006

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional information on the TDP  and the Solicitation.  Please note the changes to the solicitation as noted  below. In regard to the TDP: 1)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P7 â€“ Where is the data for this booklet?  Is this GFM?      The operatorâ€™s instruction pamphlet will be provided as GFM. 2)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P8 â€“ Is this leakage test required at the final LAP level or  at the ammo can vendor level?       The leakage test is required at the final LAP level 3)  DWG 932241 â€“ Olin is the only approved source.  We are aware that Olin has been running at capacity for several months filling contractors requirements  for 40mm M781.  What is TACOMâ€™s view on allowing other sources?      The TDP is for informational proposes only.  The round has to meet the  Performance Specification provided in the Solicitation.  Note that currently  Olin is the only .38 Caliber Case vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;  another vendor may be qualified in the future.   4)DWG 9275763 â€“ Why is this drawing in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded. 5)DWG 9345327 â€“ Same question as question #1      Currently Olin is the only primer vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;another vendor may be qualified in the future.  6)HCSDS 643 â€“ Why is this in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded.   7) The drawing for the silhouette was not provided with the TDP.      Drawing number 6006874 entitled Target Silhouette â€œEâ€ Kneeling is not part of the TDP.  Please send an email to kgorman@pica.army.mil to request a copy. 8)Is there a TDPL?      The TDPL is Document: 06BBH210A on the CD.  You may right click on the CD  and hit the explore option.  There is a version of the TDPL (06BBH210A) in  Adobe and in WordPad.  You may access the TDPL using either of the two programs.  9)Is there a drawing or more information about the tube the rounds are  placed in with the ammo can?      The dimensions of the tube are in lower right side of drawing 9209204.  In  the upper left side of the same drawing there is a â€œLIST OF PARTSâ€ box.  Line #12 and remarks C and F under the list of parts box give the specifications the  tubes are governed by.  If you look up the specifications it will give further  information on how the tube should be constructed. In regard to the solicitation: 1)Page 1 of 101 â€“ the Government says see schedule for deliver.  We  believe it says later F.O.B. origin. Please confirm with location.      Reference page 14 for Delivery information.  All items are F.O.B Origin. 2)Page 1 of 101- The government has identified the NAISC code as 332992.   Is this correct.  Ammunition over 30mm is typically 332993.        Reference page 1 block 10 and page 6 paragraph 5, the NAICS code shall be  corrected to state 332993,  the Size Standard Shall remain 1500.    3)Page 1 (& 67) of 101 â€“ The Government has identified this contract as  a small business set aside.  What is the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the  employee size and annual sales as it applies to small business and this SIC code?  What is the government interpretation in regard to subsidiaries, joint  ventures, etc.  What is the governments level of interest in ensuring that this  is awarded to true small business?  Will there be any requirement or  investigation beyond the standard SBA response of â€˜self certificationâ€™ without  independent 3rd party evaluation.        Since this solicitation involves furnishing a manufactured product, the size standard is stated in number of employees (in this solicitation that is 1,500), there is no annual sales figure involved.  The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requirement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.  Please reference page 16 for a basic  guide when clauses reference a UCF section.  In ARDEC 34 which reference H or  appendix I (52.212-1  or 52.212-4), there is no AIE listed as available in the  referenced sections.   10)Page 31 of 101 â€“ Does TACOM have MSDS from current inventory of M1006?        There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?      If the item has been produced before to the technical data package that  the vendor is to use and there have not been any modifications to the design (i.e. Engineering Changes), then the DVT could in theory be waived or just not  conducted.  We would still need to ascertain whether or not the vendorâ€™s  process is capable or â€œrobustâ€ because this is his/her first time producing the  item and First Article Testing (with subsequent Lot Acceptance Testing) is the vehicle to use to do that.  14)  Page 87 of 101 â€“ under proposal format Part â€“B design format.  What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.        Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Format paragraph a) shall be revised to  state â€œThe proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set forth in the  table below.â€ 16)  Page 87 of 101-Lists the quantities for Volumes 1,3, & 4 but no requirements for Volume 2.  Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.

If you indicate in your response to this solicitation that your quality  system conforms to one of the listed standards in Section E â€“ Higher Level  Contract Quality Requirement FAR 52.246-11, this is a sufficient description. You need not further describe your quality system in your response to the solicitation. 18)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Where do we get copies of ARDEC 148 and ARDEC 34?    As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.  The clauses are listed in numeric order. 19)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Part B â€“ (b) â€“ To supply test reports and data implies  that the contract must have already produced the round.  Is it a requirement of  the contract that the bidder have produced the round previously?        We are not requiring the round to have been previously produced.  The M1006 solicitation is based on the provided Performance Specification.  The bidder may answer the solicitation with a round that meets the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification.  In the event that another round other than the M1006 is submitted ARDEC would like to review any test data as outlined in the Performance Specification for the round being submitted.  The M1006 has test data generated from previous qualification testing.   20)  Page 89 of 101 - Proposal Instructions, item a) refers to Contract Data  requirements List (DD Form 1423 with blocks 17 and 18 completed).

It is not necessary for the Government to supply this spreadsheet to all  contractors.  This is just a sample of how the weighted guidelines will be  computed.  When submitting a proposal one only need to provide a price for each  line item and quantity range.  The Governmentâ€™s Price analysis will perform the  weighted average analysis for total price. 23)  Page 98 of 101 â€“ Evaluation of offers TDP.  Please explain what there is a  separate TDP from the government supplied TDP?     One can submit a technical data package based on the performance  specifications.

If not, MAST may have to be more repetitive to  ensure that each section has adequate content.        When submitting the proposal it is best to be as clear as possible.  Iâ€™d  suggest addressing each section as a stand alone.  If this is not practicable,  please reference the specific.   26)  General-This solicitation includes a performance specification and  drawings.  Does our submission have to meet the performance specification only  and are we free to use our design?

You may use your own design, however, it still must meet the requirements in the performance spec.The technical data package (TDP) is for informational purposes only.  You can choose to design to the TDP, but it is not a requirement of this solicitation.

<DESC>As a result of technical issues, Fedbizopps is posting the same amendment multiple times.  Please reference http://PROCNET.PICA.AMRY.MIL for a more accurate record of amendment notices.irement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.  Please reference page 16 for a basic  guide when clauses reference a UCF section.  In ARDEC 34 which reference H or  appendix I (52.212-1  or 52.212-4), there is no AIE listed as available in the  referenced sections.   10)Page 31 of 101 â€“ Does TACOM have MSDS from current inventory of M1006?        There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?      If the item has been produced before to the technical data package that  the vendor is to use and there have not been any modifications to the design (i.e. Engineering Changes), then the DVT could in theory be waived or just not  conducted.  We would still need to ascertain whether or not the vendorâ€™s  process is capable or â€œrobustâ€ because this is his/her first time producing the  item and First Article Testing (with subsequent Lot Acceptance Testing) is the vehicle to use to do that.  14)  Page 87 of 101 â€“ under proposal format Part â€“B design format.  What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.        Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Format paragraph a) shall be revised to  state â€œThe proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set forth in the  table below.â€ 16)  Page 87 of 101-Lists the quantities for Volumes 1,3, & 4 but no requirements for Volume 2.  Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.       Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Instructions paragraph b shall be revised to state â€œOriginal and four paper copies of Technical, Management Factor and  Past Performance.â€  Paragraph d shall be revised to state â€œTwo electronic  copies of (c) aboveâ€¦..â€  Page 91 of 101 is correct as stated.  17)  Page 89 of 101 - Volume I, Technical part C: Is the listed information  required, if contractor has an up-to-date ISO 9001-2000 Certification, e.g.  design of inspection and testing equipment, quality system plan, etc.?      Reference page 82 of 101 ARDEC 148 Offerorâ€™s Quality Assurance System (b) (1). If you indicate in your response to this solicitation that your quality  system conforms to one of the listed standards in Section E â€“ Higher Level  Contract Quality Requirement FAR 52.246-11, this is a sufficient description. You need not further describe your quality system in your response to the solicitation. 18)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Where do we get copies of ARDEC 148 and ARDEC 34?    As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional information on the TDP  and the Solicitation.  Please note the changes to the solicitation as noted  below. In regard to the TDP: 1)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P7 â€“ Where is the data for this booklet?  Is this GFM?      The operatorâ€™s instruction pamphlet will be provided as GFM. 2)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P8 â€“ Is this leakage test required at the final LAP level or  at the ammo can vendor level?       The leakage test is required at the final LAP level 3)  DWG 932241 â€“ Olin is the only approved source.  We are aware that Olin has been running at capacity for several months filling contractors requirements  for 40mm M781.  What is TACOMâ€™s view on allowing other sources?      The TDP is for informational proposes only.  The round has to meet the  Performance Specification provided in the Solicitation.  Note that currently  Olin is the only .38 Caliber Case vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;  another vendor may be qualified in the future.   4)DWG 9275763 â€“ Why is this drawing in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded. 5)DWG 9345327 â€“ Same question as question #1      Currently Olin is the only primer vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;another vendor may be qualified in the future.  6)HCSDS 643 â€“ Why is this in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded.   7) The drawing for the silhouette was not provided with the TDP.      Drawing number 6006874 entitled Target Silhouette â€œEâ€ Kneeling is not part of the TDP.  Please send an email to kgorman@pica.army.mil to request a copy. 8)Is there a TDPL?      The TDPL is Document: 06BBH210A on the CD.  You may right click on the CD  and hit the explore option.  There is a version of the TDPL (06BBH210A) in  Adobe and in WordPad.  You may access the TDPL using either of the two programs.  9)Is there a drawing or more information about the tube the rounds are  placed in with the ammo can?      The dimensions of the tube are in lower right side of drawing 9209204.  In  the upper left side of the same drawing there is a â€œLIST OF PARTSâ€ box.  Line #12 and remarks C and F under the list of parts box give the specifications the  tubes are governed by.  If you look up the specifications it will give further  information on how the tube should be constructed. In regard to the solicitation: 1)Page 1 of 101 â€“ the Government says see schedule for deliver.  We  believe it says later F.O.B. origin. Please confirm with location.      Reference page 14 for Delivery information.  All items are F.O.B Origin. 2)Page 1 of 101- The government has identified the NAISC code as 332992.   Is this correct.  Ammunition over 30mm is typically 332993.        Reference page 1 block 10 and page 6 paragraph 5, the NAICS code shall be  corrected to state 332993,  the Size Standard Shall remain 1500.    3)Page 1 (& 67) of 101 â€“ The Government has identified this contract as  a small business set aside.  What is the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the  employee size and annual sales as it applies to small business and this SIC code?  What is the government interpretation in regard to subsidiaries, joint  ventures, etc.  What is the governments level of interest in ensuring that this  is awarded to true small business?  Will there be any requirement or  investigation beyond the standard SBA response of â€˜self certificationâ€™ without  independent 3rd party evaluation.        Since this solicitation involves furnishing a manufactured product, the size standard is stated in number of employees (in this solicitation that is 1,500), there is no annual sales figure involved.  The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requuidelines will be  computed.  When submitting a proposal one only need to provide a price for each  line item and quantity range.  The Governmentâ€™s Price analysis will perform the  weighted average analysis for total price. 23)  Page 98 of 101 â€“ Evaluation of offers TDP.  Please explain what there is a  separate TDP from the government supplied TDP?     One can submit a technical data package based on the performance  specifications.  It is not a requirement to follow the Governmentâ€™s TDP.  The Governmentâ€™s TDP is for informational purposes only.   24)  General â€“ Is there a page limitation?      There is no page limit. 25)  General â€“ Do each section of the proposal need to stand alone?  I.E. â€“ If  we discuss additional quality aspects outside of the quality section (Technical Factor, Part C) as they relate to another area will these comments be included  in the overall evaluation?  If not, MAST may have to be more repetitive to  ensure that each section has adequate content.        When submitting the proposal it is best to be as clear as possible.  Iâ€™d  suggest addressing each section as a stand alone.

You can choose to design to the TDP, but it is not a requirement of this solicitation.

<DESC>Q:  For Level 3 workstations, are they a "U" station or a "L".  The SOW is not specific and this could change pricing drastically. A:  If I am interpreting your question correctly, then it is a â€œUâ€ than  an â€œLâ€.    Q:  For Building 12-What size stations for the Level 5?, 8x8 or 8x10?  A:  Bldg 12 is not â€œtypicalâ€ as in Section B.  Please refer to Section 3.10.1  of Delivery Order #2. Q:  Where is the main entranceway for visitors for bulding 12?  The SOW is  calling for a few reception type stations outside of offices, there is no  statement in the SOW as to where they should go.  A:  Please refer to Amendment #13 for specifics regarding Bldg 12  Admin/Reception.  The SOW is â€œgeneralâ€ for the life of the contract. Q: In building 12-which room is the conference room?  There is no label, also,  what size table is needed, there is no size specified in the SOW.  A:  Please refer to Amendment #13.  Please see requirements under 3.10.3 under  Delivery Order #2 for requirements.   Thoroughly identify all details of your  solution in your proposal. Q:  How many private offices in building 12?  The SOW is not specific as to  which is the lab and which are private. A:  Please refer to Amendment #13 and Delivery Order #2. Q:  How important is it to have a universal connector? A:  Very.   Q:  What do you consider a universal connector? A:  Metal connectors that join steel frames for quick  installation and stability.  If a cubicle needs to be moved,  it should not affect the entire unit/group.  A cubicle can  be added and another connection can be made while the  walls stay in place. Q:  Ethospace is listed as an approved product for this solicitation, but yet  you state that the thickness of the panel can be no thicker than 2-1/4" and  the Technology Wall can not exceed 5".  Ethospace's thickness (for both) is 3- 1/2".  Does this product still qualify? A:  Yes.  It was NOT our intention to exclude any manufacturer  based on any panel thicknesses, but to ensure equivalent  QUALITY across the various product lines.   In general, the  salient features of the system quality for office furniture of the  product lines listed in Section 3.6 are acceptable.   "Strict adherence to the salient features" is for functionality and quality. Q:  On page 15, the level 3 station specs state that the furniture needs to be  free standing, but on page 19 there is no mention of the workstation being  free standing furniture.  Can you please verify which it should be? A:  Page 15, Level 3, is in the Statement of Work (SOW) and "general" requirements for the life of the contract.  Level 3 can be either free standing OR system furniture based on the requirements in each Delivery Order.  Page 19 is specific to Bldg 94 and in Delivery Order #1. Q:  Section 3.9.1.1 Acoustic Requirements Per GSA document FCNE 87-441E, dated June 3, 2003, for a panel to be  considered â€œacousticalâ€ it must have and NRC= 0.65.  If we provide a panel  that meets these GSA guidelines for acoustical panels, would that be  acceptable?   A:  No.  0.65 is less absorptive to sound.  Noise is a critical factor. Q:  3.9.1.3 Would panel heights with 12â€ increments be acceptable?  For instance, are  heights of 30â€, 42â€, 56â€, 66â€, 78â€ which are currently used at Picatinny  considered to be acceptable? A:  The panel heights listed in 3.9.1.3 provides more options than  you have listed.  Increments of 12â€ would be more costly for  the Government, than one large panel.  However, if you  GUARANTEE no additional cost to the Government and that the  stacked 12â€ panels are as sturdy and structurally compatible  in terns of stability and safety, then it is acceptable. Q:  3.9.1.4 Can the nominal panel thickness exceed 2-1/4â€?  For instance, is a 3 inch  panel thickness like those currently installed at Picatinny acceptable?    A:  If the systems quality meets or exceeds the quality on  Page 5, Section 3.6 of the SOW, then the â€˜to-scale space  planâ€™ submitted with your proposal will serve to correct for  the variations. Q:  3.9.2 Add on panels Are add-on panels/tiles in height increments of 12â€ acceptable?  For example  are panel add-on units of 12â€, 24â€, 36â€, etc. acceptable? A:  If you GUARANTEE no additional cost to the Government and that the panels are as sturdy and structurally compatible in terns of  stability and safety, then it is acceptable. Q:  3.9.4 Doors Provided that 80â€ high doors meet the solid door requirements, can the 64â€  Sliding doors which will attach to the panel systems be translucent? (given  that most people can see over them anyway)  A:  No.  The two heights are required to accommodate those buildings with special requirements and taller panels. Delivery Order #1 for Bldg 94 requires sliding doors in the 80â€ height since the partitions must be a minimum of 80â€ (see page 20, under Section 3.10.3). Q:  End tables, "curved 45 degree end table" what is quantity, do they get  positioned with the 10 90 degree end tables? A:     Please check D.O. #2 and amendments.                Q:  Do the forty 30 x 60 laboratory tables become part of the 51  workstations ,and  are they an auxiilary work surface to be included in the  workstation?  If that is the case is there a description for that job level  workstation description including that 30 x 60 table. A:     No.                Q:   or are the computer tables meant to be only used in open common  areas....? â€“ A:    Please read D.O. #2 and Amendment #13. Q:  Can you please advise minuimum table requirment for the three lab tables  in each of the open plan rooms? A:  Refer to D.O. #2 and Amendments. Q:  There are no files in building 94, are the files in building 12 meant to  go into the file room or on the open floorplan.  A:  The files in Bldg 12 are meant to go on the  open floor plan in available space. Q:  Could some of the level descriptions, ie: level 2 in building 12, relate  only to South side of building? A:  No Q:   please indicate more clearly what is required of bulding 12 level 2, as  on page 21, it states no furniture requierd, but on page 15 there is a  description of level 2 furniture requiements for building 12.  A:   - Page 15 is â€œgeneralâ€ in the SOW for the life of  the contract.    - Requirements specific to Bldg 12 are in Delivery  Order #2 and some of the amendments.   - Section B, beginning on page 26 are â€œtypicalsâ€

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) anticipates a requirement for Travel Management Services for Patients at the Clinical Center Located in Bethesda, MD.    NIH is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled-veteran-owned small business, HUB Zone small business, or 8(a) firms capable of meeting the below requirements.  NIH is seeking above type sources with at least three (3) years experience with a fee-based travel booking system with multiple methods for making reservation including, but not limited to FAX, e-mail, in-person, and telephone.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to increase the scope of CLIN 0023 “Upgrade Cert (MSO-C145) MAGR 2000-S,” of contract FA8807-05-D-0001, awarded to Raytheon as a letter contract on 17 Dec 04, and definitized on17 Mar 06.  The NAICS code of this acquisition is 334511, SBA size standard 750 employees.

The following is a summary of the changes in scope resulting from the forthcoming modification to said contract:

The Government provided Raytheon which software modules in the MAGR 2-S needed to comply with the Requirements and Technical Concepts for Aviation (RTCA) Document Number (DO) 178B Software Considerations in Airborne System and Equipment Certification.   In doing so, the Government erroneously excluded four modules that should have been included, based on the false assumption that these modules would not share the same memory as the remaining software modules. Upon further analysis, Raytheon determined that memory sharing did occur. Therfore, the four modules need to be added to the scope of the effort in order for Raytheon to comply with DO-178B and thereby enable the MAGR 2K-S to be certified for Precise Positioning Service in National and International airspace.  The following four modules titled CDU, Flight Instrument, Instrumentation Port, and RNAV will be added back into the evaluation for compliance with RTCA/DO-178B.

Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems is the sole manufacturer of MAGR 2000-S and is the only known company capable of providing the Government’s requirements.  Interested parties may submit a Statement of Capabilities no later than 18 August 2006 to the Contract Negotiator, Capt Mark Santasiero, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245, (310) 653-3846.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
Office of Personnel Management
Entrance on Duty Solution
1.  Background:
The President’s Management Agenda (PMA) requires Federal agencies to expand the use of electronic government (e-Gov) to improve efficiency and enhance the quality of services provided to citizens.  Under the PMA, several lines of business have been established to consolidate, improve and streamline business processes across the Executive Branch.

The Human Resources Line of Business (HR LOB) initiative was launched in 2004 to support the vision articulated in the President’s Management Agenda.  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the managing partner for the HR LOB.  

The HR LOB is expected to help the Federal government realize the potential of electronic government by significantly enhancing human resources service delivery within the Executive Branch.  The HR LOB Concept of Operations (CONOPS) proposes a near-term service delivery model where some highly transactional and administratively intense HR services move from the agencies to HR shared service centers.  This approach will allow agencies to increase their focus on core mission activities and the strategic management of human capital, with HR shared service centers delivering the HR transactional services in an efficient and cost-effective manner focused on customer service quality.

The HR LOB Program is developing Enterprise Architecture, in compliance with the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) guidelines as prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  To date the HR LOB and its member agencies have developed three of the five reference models that make up the FEA.  

One of those models, the Business Reference Model (BRM), describes a government-wide view of the sub-functions, processes and activities that agencies perform to deliver HR services to employees of the Federal government.  “Entrance on Duty” (EOD) falls within the BRM sub-function “Staff Acquisition” and includes bringing on new hires and transferring Federal employees.  HR LOB Business Reference Model and Core Requirements are available at http://www.opm.gov/egov/.

The HR LOB, in concert with Federal agencies, is developing detailed requirements for a standard government-wide approach to EOD that will be incorporated into an EOD Concept of Operations.  The CONOPS will also provide results of an EOD market analysis, propose a process and technology concept model for delivering EOD services, and recommend an overall acquisition strategy for Entrance on Duty.  

In addition to the EOD initiative, OPM, through the Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) project, is also moving forward to replace hard copy employee Official Personnel Files (OPFs) with electronic versions.  Documents currently contained in OPFs will be digitally imaged, and new transactions stored in an electronic format.  When completed, employees, HR professionals, and managers will be able to view the OPF electronically.    
2.  Description of Information Requested:
Note:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  No solicitation will be issued at this time.  

Federal agencies have a potential requirement for an Entrance on Duty (EOD) solution that can automate labor-intensive, manual processes, seamlessly integrate with other government-wide services, and provide sufficient functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of all government agencies.  Systems based on commercial or government off-the-shelf software will be considered.     

Vendors responding to this RFI must provide:

1. Name and address of the firm
2. Size of the business with type of ownership (i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, hub-zone, and/or disabled veteran)
3. Years in business
4. Description of the client base
5. Capability Statement containing documentation showing the successful completion of IT projects of similar complexity within the past three years.

OPM is engaged in preliminary market research and is currently consolidating and/or refining requirements from several federal agencies for an EOD solution.  Accordingly, the purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from vendors regarding commercially available products and services which are capable of meeting Federal EOD needs.     

Capability Statements must demonstrate ability to provide solutions with respect to the following six major BRM activities associated with Entrance on Duty: 

1. Extending the job offer.

The contract may als o include horizontal and vertical construction projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Southwestern Division.  The market research survey seeks to identify industrys experience, past performance, and capabilities to execute this program.  The Gover nment must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of contractors, which is the purpose of this Market Research.  Based on the responses received from the Market Research Survey, an acquisition strategy will be determined.  THIS PROGR AM IS NOT RESTRICTED AND IS OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Notice of Intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Plastics Pallets (Twin Sheet Thermoformed)
<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Twin Sheet Thermoformed Plastic Palletmic, Manufacturing.  
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Lenses, Ophthalmic, Manufacturing.  According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Edith Butler, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 481-1788; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.§ 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR §121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR §121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Lenses, Ophthalmic, Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 339115.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<SUBJECT>N -- Energy Management and Control System
<DESC>The Government intends to award a contract for installation of Direct Digital Controls/Energy Management Control System to four facilities at Beale AFB, California as a direct award to Siemens Building Technologies, Inc.  The contractor will provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment and labor.  This solicitation is a sole source award under FAR 6.302-1.  

Siemens has been the current contractor for the DDC/EMCS system at Beale AFB since 21 March 2003.  Market research has established Siemens as the only known capable company, which can provide building automation to fulfill the Beale AFB requirement. 

The DDC at Beale AFB is an Apogee Insight system manufactured solely by Siemens Building Technologies, Inc.  Siemens has no authorized distributors.  Beale AFB currently has 60 facilities, with 22,000 points and 80-field panels on-line with this system.  The Apogee Insight system (hardware and software is proprietary in nature).  In order to maintain coordinated system growth, consistency and lower training costs, all DDC support system procurement must be Apogee Insight.  This requirement is part of that upgrade.  Therefore, it is not in the government’s best interest to introduce a potentially new contractor during this transition.  A new contractor could result in untimely delays of service and potential man-hours lost in training.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334512.  The small business standard is 500 employees.  The entire solicitation will be released as “other than full and open” solely on the Electronic Posting System (EPS), www.eps.gov, (paper copies will not be available).  This award is based on the availability of funds before September 30, 2005.

<SUBJECT>15 -- Request for  Information (RFI), Market Research on New Manufacturing Techniques for Cost Savings for the upcoming Air Superiority Target (AST) program
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  

The 691st Armament Systems Squadron is in the process of conducting an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the next generation Air Superiority Target (AST).  As part of that analysis, independent cost estimates are being developed for viable material solutions.   The Government is interested in receiving information on new technologies that will lower the cost of new airframe construction using composite materials and new manufacturing techniques.  Manufacturers engaged in using these new techniques are invited to assist in this effort by sharing data related to potential cost savings that the Government might expect to see from the use of these new technologies.   If determined to be beneficial, the Government would also be interested in site visits to witness innovative approaches first hand. 

Rules of Engagement.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.   Any formal solicitation will be announced at a later date. This RFI is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.   Any costs associated with participating in these exchanges are at the expense of the company.   The Government will treat all parties neutrally whether or not they participate in exchanges.  There is no obligation on the part of the Government, nor will any contract result from these exchanges (reference Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201).   The formal source selection process starts at release of the request for proposal (RFP).   Until RFP release, the Government will proactively continue market research, industry exchanges, and maximize release of all strategies and information via the FedBizOpps website.  We are not seeking proprietary information as a result of these exchanges; however, if it is necessary to respond, please properly designate it.  The Government will follow the guidance of FAR 15.201(f) concerning information provided to/from industry. 

The Government envisions that the information provided will be included in the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) final report. If any proprietary data is included in the information package, it should be clearly marked as such. In accordance with FAR 15.207, the government will ensure that all information marked as proprietary data will be safeguarded adequately from unauthorized disclosure. 

Market Research Questions. Considering the above information, please respond to the following questions in this preliminary exchange of information.  We would greatly appreciate any feedback that industry has to offer.

Boundaries of the RFI:  Information should be related to high performance, greater than Mach1, full scale (~50 feet length, ~30 wing span), 2 external payload stations (1000lbs each), capable of maneuvering up to 5g sustained turn. 

1.  On a comparative basis, is there a cost/schedule reduction associated with fabricating components out of composites instead of aluminum? Is there data to support this cost/schedule reduction for a full scale supersonic fighter aircraft capable of carrying external payloads? If not, is there a similar application of composites that you believe could be extrapolated to this application?  Please provide any data and justification for extrapolation.

2.  What are the issues with full-scale, fighter-size, supersonic, composite bonding/adhesion?  What data is available for the bonding limits in a high performance maneuvering aircraft?  If there is no data for this application, is there a similar application of composites that you believe could be extrapolated to this application?  Please provide any data and justification for extrapolation. What are the cost/schedule implications of bonding issues?  
3.  Is there any data on the breakout of the fabrication tasks and schedule associated with composite approach to manufacturing a full-scale, high performance, maneuvering with payload, greater than Mach 1 aircraft?  If not, is there a similar application of composites that you believe could be extrapolated to this application?  Please provide any data and justification for extrapolation.  What are the primary factors of the composite fabrication and assembly that influence cost and schedule?  Please provide any supporting data.  

4.  For a full scale, supersonic fighter aircraft a number of wind tunnel model iterations should be expected in the early stages of design.  Are there design iteration considerations which need to be addressed in the cost estimate?  How much of the wind tunnel model needs to be re-fabricated for inlet design changes?  What are the cost/schedule implications of wind tunnel model iterations?  

5. Will more actual testing be required for the composite material designs compared to more similarity analysis for conventional designs? Compared to test and certification methods for conventional materials, are testing and certification efforts reduced when building an aircraft out of composite materials, using composite fabrication?  Please provide any data for a full-scale, high performance, maneuvering with payload, greater than Mach 1 aircraft?  If data is not available for this application, is there a similar application of composites that you believe could be extrapolated to this application?  Please provide any data and justification for extrapolation. 

6.  Do any substantiated cost models (estimating tools/methods) exist that can be applied in projecting development and production costs for a full-scale, high performance, maneuvering with payload, greater than Mach 1 aircraft?  Are these cost models and associated documentation available for government use?  If so, how were these substantiated and can the be provided with the response to this RFI?  

7. What are the principal risks in applying a ‘fully-composite’ development/fabrication and test approach to a vehicle that must exhibit 4.5 to 5th generation fighter performance?  Could a ‘hybrid’ airframe design (optimized mix of conventional and composite components) be cost-competitive with a fully-composite design for this application? What is the estimated percentage of conventional structure that can be replaced with composite material?  

8.  Can you provide any documented repair procedures for composite materials?  Can you provide any documented maintenance procedures for accessing internal components of the aircraft once it has been sealed?  Is there any data that compares conventional repair and maintenance cost and schedule to composite aircraft cost and schedule? What are the differences in repair costs between conventional repairs and composite repairs? Please provide any data to support the information provided.  

No classified information will be accepted. A determination has been made that foreign participation will be prohibited.   Interested parties capable of providing information are invited to submit information packages no later than 15 September 2006 (earlier submittal is highly encouraged). If using Federal Express, United Parcel Service, or if hand carrying, deliver to 691st ARSS-PK, Building 11, 3rd Floor, Attn:  Capt. Rebecca Little, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810. If mailing, send to 691st ARSS-PK, Attn: Capt. Rebecca Little, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 373, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810. Please include the following: Contractor’s name, mailing address, telephone numbers, fax number(s), email address, CAGE code, and business size (i.e. small, small disadvantage, 8(a), woman-owned, HBCU/MI, veteran-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, or large business). This is not a request for proposal. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire products or services. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI and all information shall be made available at no cost to the government. If any response(s) is (are) received, acknowledgement of receipt will not be made nor will evaluation of any information provided be given at this time.

<SUBJECT>R -- Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY. Department of the Air Force, 375th Contracting Squadron, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5302.

2.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED. Non-Personal Service Sole Source Contract with Living Works, #4303D 11th Street, SE, Calgary AB, Canada T2G 4X1. 

3.	DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY’S NEEDS.  HQ AMC, Scott AFB, IL, requires Living Works to provide one (1) Suicide Intervention Instructor Training Workshop (T4T) to include all materials (workbooks, certificates, course survey, Personal Background Questionnaire, handbook and support). Estimated dollar value for Suicide Intervention Training for Trainers for 24 participants is $60,000.

4.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.

5.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACOUISITION REOUIRES THE USE ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE. Living Works is the only source that can satisfy the Government’s requirements, primarily because the vendor has the sole proprietary rights and has not licensed any third party vendors to distribute/transact their material.  In addition, over the past 5 years Scott AFB has trained personnel in ASIST techniques.  The cost to switch to another curriculum would be prohibitive as all trained personnel would have to be retrained, in addition to all new personnel. In 2003 General Jumper allowed the command commanders to determine which training program would be used within each command.  AMC has chosen to use the ASIST program. 

6.	DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICTED FROM As MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE.  Sole Source intent posted to Government Point of Entry (FEDBIZOPS).

7.	DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE.  HQ AMC/HC has conducted extensive research to find other sources of this training/material but Living Works is the sole proprietor and distributor.  AMC requires all instructors teaching Suicide Intervention to first be certified through Living Works in order to maintain their accreditation. This makes it impossible to acquire suicide intervention material from any other vendor.

8.	DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED. Living Works Education, Inc., is the only organization with a record of training large numbers (200,000+) comparable to the Air Force population, with a reliable, clinically demonstrated method in a two-day format. Further, Living Works has the only process that we have been able to find with a five-day program to train instructors for the two-day skill intervention. Verification that Living Works has the only program of its kind with the breadth of experience comes from the American Association of Suicidology. Market Research has produced one other organization, QPR, Suicide Prevention Institute, Spokane, Washington, but without the necessary track record of training, nor the two-day format, nor the five-day instructor training process.

<SUBJECT>-- Family Advocacy Program Strengthening Army Training
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE) hereby announces its intent to award a sole source contract to FranklinCovey located at 2200 Parkway Blvd, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2099 to support the of the US Army Community and Family Support  Center in providing training sessions on Franklin Coveys 7 Habits of Highly Effective Army Families training program  to Active, Guard and Reserve Army Soldiers and their families in any of the ten (10) Army installations/sites; and later expanding to 95  Army installations/sites throughout CONUS during the life of the contract.  The total period of performance for this action is four years, consisting of a 12 month base and three 12 month option periods.  The statutory authority permitting this award unde r other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   The proprietary exclusivity for product distribution combined with the need for a turn-key program including a custom curriculum, measurement and delivery vehicle indicates sole sourcing with FranklinCovey as the most feasible and cost effective solution  in meeting the contractual requirements.  FranklinCovey has created a holistic framework for increasing the overall effectiveness and quality performance of complex organizations, as well as for improving effectiveness in ones personal life with family, neighbors, and community endeavors.  While the principles of this framework are universal, the unique capabilities of FranklinCoveys approach to quality and organizational performance are not replicated elsewhere in the consulting or training industry. Th erefore, it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire these services from FranklinCovey on a sole source basis.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  The Government will not issue a solicitation.  A determination not to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Informati on received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Contract award is anticipated not later than 28 September 2006.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL (CB) PROTECTIVE GLOVES DESCRIPTION THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL NOR DOES THE GOVERNMENT INTEND TO PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.   The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information and product samples for CB protective handwear items that exhibit improved human factors performance over the military 7 mil butyl chemical protective glove (MIL-G-43976) and also provide flame-resistance (F R).  Responses to this solicitation may involve material or products that are in any stage of development.  Information and samples may include any of the following: (1) Comfort Liners - for sweat absorption (novel ideas are encouraged, e.g., liners without fingertips);  (2) CB Protective Liners - intended for wear under the Summer Flyers Glove (SFG) or similar outer duty glove;  (3) Stand-Alone Gloves - that provide both CB and FR protection;  (4) FR Over-Glove - with the same wear concept as the SFG; and  (5) Glove Systems  a multi-piece system that provides both CB and FR protection.   Please note that glove concepts 1 and 4 do not require CB protection.  Product samples obtained by this RFI shall be examined and tested with results being used for developing future CB glove requirements and/or acquisition strategies.  Performance areas o f particular interest that may be tested on samples submitted include, but are not limited to: tactility, dexterity, melting, grip, comfort, heat stress, durability, safety, and integration with CB ensembles.  This is an open search, and not limited to cur rent CB glove solutions in the Department of Defense (DoD) inventory.  Submissions to the previous JB2GU Request for Proposal (RFP) should not be submitted to this RFI unless size, fit, or construction has been altered to further improve tactility and dext erity. While CB protection is required, this RFI primarily seeks glove products that demonstrate the ability to provide improved human factors performance; subsequently, CB protection threshold and objective challenge levels shall not be defined.  Vendors are req uired, however, to specify the level of protection afforded by their CB glove submissions.   CB protective glove products sought by this RFI are intended for use across multiple DoD operational areas to include aviation, ground, and shipboard, combat service support, peacekeeping, special operations, logistical functions, and CB warfare training.  Especially desirable are CB protective glove products that demonstrate improved fine finger tactility and dexterity performance applicable to use of standard computer keyboards, palm pilot-type computers, flight panel operations in fixed-wing and rotary a ircraft, and handling and manipulating small items.  In general, the requirements outlined for the JB2GU (Type I) FR (excluding the CB threshold challenge level) can be used as guidance; however, the following Human Factors requirements are emphasized: Tactility, Dexterity, and Comfort.  Threshold Requirements: greater than 7 mil butyl worn under SFG.  Comfort liners, CB protective liners, stand-alone gloves, FR over-gloves, and glove systems must have improved fine-finger tactility and dexterity.  Tacti lity is herein defined as the ability to feel with fingers to perform tasks.  Dexterity is herein defined as ability to move/manipulate hands and fingers and grasp items to perform tasks.  Glove products shall not exhibit slippage of glove materials agains t the skin.  Glove liner products shall not significantly degrade the tactility and dexterity of over-gloves they are worn with.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director (OD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Hastings Center, 255 Elm Road, Briarcliff Manor, NY  10510, for professional consulting services for evaluating ethical, legal and societal issues (ELSI) in biomedical nanotechnology for a period of one year.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541710, and the business size is 500 employees.

The contract shall:

1.	Identify the major ELSI issues raised by biomedical nanotechonology.

2.	Shall consider whether and how ELSI issues are addressed by existing ELSI and other related scholarship activity.  Gaps shall be identified in knowledge, and lessons learned shall be characterized pertinent to nano concerns.

3.	Shall suggest thoughtful strategic approaches for responding to new or extant nano-specific ELSI issues.

4.	Shall determine the fair and appropriate ways to communicate to identifiable audiences about the technology’s emerging issues in a way that earns and maintains public trust.

5.	This project shall be developed as a phased, iterative process, with activities at each phase being developed by the contractor on the basis on interactive consensus reached at monthly or more frequent conference calls and/or meetings with the Office of Science Policy (OSP) staff and selected members of the Trans NIH Nanotechnology Task Force.

6.	The three (3) phases to be developed by the contractor shall be as follows:

a.	Phase I (Background and Information Accrual)  This shall entail development of a critical synthesis of findings and lessons learned from the ELSI and other relevant literatures on communicating with the public, and from personal interviews and other methods as appropriate (e.g. focus groups) with biomedical investigators, scientists, engineers, ethicists and policymakers.  This phase shall also entail focus on ELSI issues that arise when biomedical research involves nanotechnology, with specific emphasis on in-depth exploration of safety, public trust and understanding, and governance.

b.	Phase II (Refine Key Questions for NIH)  Based on the findings from the Phase I work, the contractor shall work interactively with NIH staff to focus and refine those questions and critical analyses (emerging from Phase I) which are most pertinent to this agency’s needs in the ELSI nanotechnology arena.  For all scheduled conference calls and meetings throughout the course of this project, the contractor shall electronically submit written materials for discussion and development to NIH staff three days in advance.

c.	Phase III (Synthesis, Summary and Recommendations)  During the final two months of the contract period, the contractor shall develop a White Paper providing an annotated description of key ELSI issues – new or old – in nanobiomedicine that are most relevant and pressing for NIH, and an integrative synthesis of these findings.

7.	The contractor shall have at least 30 years experience in bioethics research, and exploring fundamental and emerging questions in health care, biotechnology, and the environment.

8.	The contractor shall have at least 20 years of expertise in Genetics and Biotechnology; Ethics, Science & Environment; Health Care & Health Policy; and Ethics & Scientific Research.

9.	The contractor shall be able to quickly and reliably identify those ELSI issues that will be unique to biomedical nanotechnology (nano-ethics) and those that have been addressed previously in other scientific fields and may have bearing on biomedical nanotechnology.

The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  The Hastings Center is believed to be uniquely qualified to perform the work identified above due to its unique status as an independent, nonpartisan and nonprofit bioethics research institute with interdisciplinary teams experienced in the fields of genetics and biotechnology, ethics, science and environment, health care and health policy, and ethics and scientific research.  This organization has a unique background includes extensive research focusing on ethical, legal and social issues in emerging biomedical technologies such as genetics research and neuron-ethics and already exhibits the prerequisite knowledge necessary to quickly and reliably identify those ethical, legal and social issues that will be unique to nano-ethics, as well as those that have been addressed previously in other scientific fields and may have bearing on biomedical nanotechnology.  This expertise is critical in successfully completing the required work within the necessary timeframe, and their imprimatur is critical in ensuring that key questions are addressed and that findings are accepted by target audiences.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.

However, all quotes received within ten (10) days after the date of publication (August 3, 2006) of the synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

-STATEMENT OF WORK-
The Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) is initiating a program to provide enhanced advisory support and compliance assistance to labor organizations to promote union democracy, transparency, and financial integrity under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA).  This initiative supports the Department’s Performance Goal for a secure workforce by increasing compliance with worker protection laws, specifically LMRDA protections to ensure union financial integrity, democracy, and transparency. The initiative provides for enhanced outreach, compliance assistance, and union advisory services to monitor and assist unions in complying with the requirements of the LMRDA.

OLMS will establish a contactor-staffed union advisory unit to directly address three problems that currently cause unions to be in violation of the LMRDA or the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) in the case of Federal-employee unions.  
1.	The first problem is that frequently union constitutions and bylaws do not conform to the requirements of the LMRDA and CSRA.  The unit will review union constitutions and bylaws to determine if they contain any provisions that are in conflict with these statutes.  The unit will advise unions of the changes necessary to bring any conflicting provisions into compliance with the Acts.
2.	The second problem is that unions frequently do not file their current constitution and bylaws with OLMS.  The LMRDA requires covered unions to adopt a constitution and bylaws and file a copy with OLMS both initially with the union’s Form LM-1, Labor Organization Information Report, and annually thereafter whenever the constitution and bylaws are amended.  The union advisory unit will institute a program to ensure that OLMS has an up-to-date copy of every union’s constitution and bylaws available for public disclosure on the OLMS Web site.  This will ensure that union members and the public have access to the union governing documents that the law requires be available to them.
3.	The third problem relates to the LMRDA requirement that a union’s Form LM-1 cite the constitutional provisions relating to 13 specific practices and procedures, such as levying assessments or authorizing disbursement of union funds.  If the constitution does not address a procedure, the union must file a detailed statement describing the procedure.   If the procedure changes, the union must filed an amended Form LM-1.  Many unions either do not file a detailed statement or cite a constitutional provision that does not describe the procedure in adequate detail.  Or if they file correctly initially, they do not file an amended Form LM-1 as required when practices and procedures are changed.  The union advisory unit will review a union’s Form LM-1 in conjunction with its constitution and bylaws to insure that the 13 specific practices and procedures are described in sufficient detail to comply with the legal requirements and reflect the union’s current practices and procedures.
The unit will work with unions at the national, intermediate, and local levels to remedy these problems.  Contract staff in the unit will work under the direction of a career employee in the OLMS Office of Policy, Reports, and Disclosure.

5.	Makes effective oral presentations of the analyses to OLMS staff and to labor organization officers and employees as requested.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure licenses to access the Federal Marine Fisheries Regulations Coast Guard wide from the period of performance of  01 September 2005 to 31 August 2006.  This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Therefore, please read this entire notice, the instructions herein, and the attachment documents carefully.  This acquisition is on a(n) Small business set aside basis.  SCOPE: Statement of Work

Major Tasks:  

1. Supplier agrees to provide Federal Marine Fisheries Regulations to the United States Coast Guard (USCG), for the period of 1 September 2006 through 31 August 2007.  These regulations will be utilized by fisheries boarding officers, aircraft commanders and operations oversight personnel to enforce federal fisheries regulations at-sea and on the dock.  Key requirements of these regulations are that:

a. They must be clearly organized and formatted to provide quick and easy access for enforcement personnel to the appropriate section of the regulations.  As many sections of the regulations reference other sections, section references should be clearly linked for quicker reference by enforcement personnel. For the period from 1 September 2006 through 31 August 2007, the irrevocable, non-exclusive right to use, store, reproduce in any medium, or transmit in any form or by any means, all the data and updates (deliverables) described in this SOW; supplier retains the right to sell or otherwise market to any other entity or individual the data and service covered by this SOW.

b. They must be kept up-to-date with updates provided to the Coast Guard on a regular basis, at a minimum monthly.

c. They must contain all appropriate parts of Titles 15, 46 (Part 28 only) and 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations that are enforced by the Coast Guard.  Current regulations being provided include 50 CFR 216, 222, 223, 224, 226, 229, 230, 300, 403, 600, 622, 635, 640, 648, 654, 660, 679, and 697; 15 CFR 904 and 922; 46 CFR 28 and the Lacey Act, 16 USC 3371-3378.

d. They must be provided in electronic .chm format, windows CE and Palm format.  The supplier should be able to provide at the request of field units a paper copy of all or portions of these regulations—excluding regulations applicable to the U.S. west coast—in the form of its Books GEN, ADM, NE/MA, and SA/C/G, paid for by the requesting units at a cost in addition to this contract.  Paper copy service should also include a monthly update feature.

The USCG will ensure that the data provided to it under this agreement, in whatever form, is protected from use by anyone outside the Coast Guard.  Excerpts from the regulations will be allowed to be used by the Coast Guard for inclusion in law enforcement case packages and other official purposes, whereby the information will be transferred outside the Coast Guard.

2. In addition, supplier will maintain the existing Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) regulated areas database.  This database consolidates all the geographically defined regulatory areas in the federal marine fisheries regulations into one Excel file so that these areas may be imported into Coast Guard command and control systems.  Supplier will need to provide all areas that are promulgated as final regulations, provided that can be done on the basis of the regulatory text, plus use of MapTech software for the sole purpose of creating latitude and longitude points for land intersections described in the regulations.  For this purpose, the USCG will provide the supplier with MapTech software program and data disks.  Updates must be provided on a regular basis, at a minimum monthly.  VMS updates should be formatted identically to that being used at present (Microsoft Excel spreadsheets), and updated files will be transmitted via e-mail.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to purchase through sole source from Innov-X Systems, 100 Sylvan Road, Suite 100, Woburn, MA,  01801, an Innov-X Model a-4000S Hand Held Trace Level Elemental XRF Analyzer that will be used for research and routine testing of a broad range of Library collection materials, collection housing materials, and collection environments for trace elements.  It is the Library’s understanding that the identified instrument system is the only one commercially available in the U.S. that is capable of meeting the Library’s critical performance requirement for a hand-held XRF analyzer that also meets the following needs:  It must be a waterproof, single-module, handheld XRF system that uses an x-ray tube with a tungsten anode that can operate from 10-40 kV with a current of 10–50 µA; it must be controlled by a removable PDA that has on-board software and a computing platform, uses a WindowsTM CE software platform, has an Intel 400 MHz StrongArmTM processor or higher, has 128 Mb or higher internal memory, has one-Gb or higher flash memory to store up to at least 100,000 analyses, and is BluetoothTM-enabled to permit display, printing, and data transfer via Microsoft ActiveSyncTM software to a WindowsTM based PC that also can control the instrument remotely without a hard-wire link to the analyzer; it must weigh no more than four pounds with built-in Li-ion batteries, and the batteries must have an 8-hour duty cycle, be rechargeable (charger included), and power the analyzer and iPAQ simultaneously; it must have a narrow, extended snout (1 3/8” width maximum, 2 ½” length/extension minimum) with a welding mask for access to tight spaces and to provide a narrow beam focus; it must have at least five internal filters that can be used to modify the incident x-ray spectrum to optimize the sensitivity for analysis of elements of interest with the filter positions, beam voltages, and currents all under computer control and menu driven by touchscreen user interface.; it must have a Si PiN diode detector that is thermoelectrically cooled to provide an energy resolution of < 260 eV FWHM at 5.95 keV Mn K-alpha line; for safety, it must be able to be turned on and off using a "deadman" trigger or a start/stop icon controlled from an external processor, it must have a sensor to turn off the analyzer when no sample is over the window, and it must have an automatic trigger lock to lock the system when inactive for five minutes; it must have a fully featured algorithm to permit the calculation of concentrations of at least Pb, Cr, Hg, Pd, Cd, Hf, Sb, V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sn, Ag, As, Se, Au, Ba, Co, Zr, Rb, Cl, Pt, P, Bi, Ti, Nb, Mo, W, Ta, Re, and S with a user selectable level of sensitivity with concentrations being automatically displayed in ppm, count rate, or other user-specified units depending on the software mode selected; it must automatically correct for size and shape to allow accurate quantitation of small, curved samples; software must (1) provide the ability to add elements into the fundamental parameters calibration without returning system to factory or service center, (2) allow modification of the calibration for any element in any analysis mode, (3) provide spectral matching using stored reference sample spectra in a library that contains at least 500 reference spectra, (4) have a light element analysis feature to allow quantitative analysis of elements as light as phosphorous, (5) include a mode that allow operator to generate up to 25 different empirical calibration models, (6) and include a mode allowing filter, wipes, paper, and photographs to be analyzed quantitatively and report the data as ppm per unit area; the data must be directly exportable to standard spreadsheet programs that require textual tab, comma, or similar delineated files; accessories must include a hands-free testing stand with an interlock that requires the test stand cover to be closed prior to energizing the x-ray tube, a tripod mount, an AC adapter to permit operation using 110-V power, and a carrying case; and there must be manufacturer authorized training and assistance and a 2-year warranty (parts and labor).  Any other company that, at the time of application, (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity or capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business, and (2) believes its elemental analysis system can meet all the above equipment performance requirements can apply to the Library for consideration.

<SUBJECT>R -- Evaluate the Target Catch & Bycatch Reduction Effectiveness of Surface and Mid-Water Drift Gillnets in Trinidad
<SOLNBR>NFFK0-6-419

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number NFFK0-6-419 is issued as a request for quotation.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 813312.  The single largest threat to the Critically Endangered leatherback turtle in Trinidad, and arguably through-out the Atlantic Ocean, is the accidental capture of the species in coastal gillnet fisheries.   The entanglement problem in Trinidad also places a severe strain on the ability of fishers to operate economically, and is so severe that many are unable to fish during the leatherback nesting season.   In a number of studies, it is estimated that as many as 3,000 entanglements occur each year in Trinidad and that as much as 35% of those entanglements result in the death of the turtle (Fournillier and Eckert 1999; Eckert and Lien 1999; Lee Lum, 2003, Gass, 2005).   In response to this problem, the NMFS sponsored a National Consultation hosted by the international Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network (WIDECAST) and the Fisheries Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Marine Resources of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.   Invited participants included stakeholders from the fishing communities in Trinidad and Tobago; non-government conservation organizations; international fishing and conservation experts and Trinidad and Tobago government natural resource management agencies and the Foreign Affairs Ministry.   The objective of the consultation was to develop a plan to reduce the interaction of leatherback turtles with the fishery without reducing the ability of fishers to support themselves.   The output of the consultation was a plan that describes a series of investigations to be undertaken in bycatch reduction (Eckert and Eckert, 2005) with the eventual objective that one or more of the reduction methods could be adopted by the fishery.  Such methods include the evaluation of new bait types, (artificial, dead and non-traditional) to enhance hook and line fishing as a replacement for nets.  Also described was use of new technologies or gear modifications such as power take-up reels or using alternate net materials, and Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD).  It was also proposed that modifications in net fishing methods be tested such as adjusting the depth of the net to avoid surface swimming turtles.  Devising means to repel turtles from nets was also recommended, such as the use of sonic pingers which are effective on small cetaceans, and the adding of shark silhouettes to the nets.  Finally, new regulatory regimes were considered that would ban net fishing from 1 March to 31 May within a region extending from the southern end of Fishing Pond Beach to the western end of Paria Beach and extending 8 km offshore.    The primary goal of this initial gear experiment is to determine whether a modified mid-water set gillnet can be successfully deployed and fished in local Trinidad waters and whether the target catch can be realized.  Specific objectives follow: 1) Conduct an experiment testing conventional surface set gillnets and modified mid-water set gillnets to evaluate bycatch of several species groups; 2) Compare the catch rates of target species of finfish for each net type; 3) Compare the catch rates of bycatch species of finfish for each net type; 4) Compare the catch rates of sea turtles for each net type; and 5) Collect basic life history information on all captured turtles.  The contractor shall provide the following tasks:  a) Construct two experimental and two control gillnets of 250 yards length each; b) Convene planning and training meetings with identified fishers to review study design, implementation, and reporting; c) Conduct at-sea training of selected fishers to ensure gear is deployed properly and all necessary data are properly collected and recorded; d) Conduct 30 fishing trips in 2006 along the Northern and Eastern Coasts of Trinidad.  Quantify target catch and bycatch catch per unit effort (CPUEs) in an experimental mid-water drift gillnet and in a traditional surface drift gillnet, using a matched pair experimental design.  Traditionally set standard surface drift gillnets will serve as controls, while experimental nets will consist of identical nets suspended approximately 10 to 15 feet below the surface.   Construct nets (250 yards in length) of materials that are consistent with gear used by local fishermen; e) Deploy paired nets in a manner consistent with traditional fishing practices.  Acquire GPS readings for each end and the middle of each net in the paired deployments; f) Use an observer on each trip to collected data consisting of date, location (latitude longitude via GPS of each end and middle of each net), catch, bycatch and effort data for each net type within each haul.  Use standard NMFS data sheets for recording data; g) Collect information on each captured turtle, including species, photographs, measurements as possible dependent on sea conditions, sex (if possible), determine whether PIT or flipper tags are present and record data.  Sea conditions permitting, apply flipper and PIT tags to unmarked turtles; and h) Calculate catch rates for target species and bycatch (catch/yards of gillnet/hour soaked).  Conduct pair-wise comparisons of CPUEs for each catch category for control and experimental nets to detect significant differences.  The period of Performance is date of award through August 31, 2007.  Deliverables: The contractor shall submit a Progress Report on or before October 31, 2006, a Second Progress Report on or before January 31, 2007 and submit five (5) copies of the Final Comprehensive Report on or before August 31, 2007.

The workshop will bring together NMFS staff, leading veterinarians, pathobiologists, and marine mammal scientists, and others, to share new data and information on serious injuries of marine mammals.  The objectives of the workshop are to evaluate NMFS’ existing process and guidelines for determining what constitutes a serious injury of marine mammals, identify data and information needs, and develop updated guidelines and/or policy for serious injury determinations.  The Serious Injury Workshop will advance NMFS’ ability to accurately evaluate serious injury of marine mammals through sharing new information on types and frequencies of injuries and the fate of seriously injured marine mammals.  It will also allow relevant stakeholders to provide input on the issue.  NMFS’ is mandated under the Marine Mammal Protection Act to reduce serious injury of marine mammals during commercial fishing operations, and other activities that interact with marine mammals.  Marine mammal/fisheries issues, including serious injury determinations and methods for making such determinations, are contentious.  The workshop will be convened during a limited time period and, therefore, strict adherence to the agenda and timeline is necessary for the success of the workshop.  To ensure the focus of the workshop is maintained and objectives achieved, experienced, professional facilitators are needed.  The workshop will review current NMFS serious injury determination guidelines and processes, present new information on the pathobiology of injuries and known outcomes of certain injury types, identify information needs, and work towards developing updated guidelines for making serious injury determinations.  Facilitation is needed to provide conflict resolution and mediation as necessary, ensure the participants remain focused on the issue or particular agenda items during the workshop, and ensure that workshop objectives are achieved.  The contractor will provide support for the following tasks:  (1) Review and finalize agenda and related supporting materials in consultation with NMFS staff and Steering Committee; (2) Work with Steering Committee to focus facilitation strategy; (3) Prepare workshop facilitated activities; (4) Conduct ongoing coordination with workshop organizers; (5) Conduct workshop facilitation; and (6) Develop final report(s) that summarizes workshop presentations, discussions, and key outcomes.  Deliverables:  The contractor will provide two facilitators, one senior facilitator and one associate facilitator, to assist in finalizing the workshop agenda and meeting preparation prior to November 1, 2006.

Combiners typically contain resonant cavities and dual isolators tuned to pass certain frequencies a nd reject other frequencies Lightning Protection System: Passive and Active components designed to shunt the energy of a lightning strike to an installed grounding system.  The protection system consists of coaxial cable shield grounds and in-line surge arrestors mounted in enclosure s, and connected to the grounding system with copper conductors.      Radio Frequency Power Amplifier: Amplifier installed in the output transmission path of a transmitter designed to amplify output power to an acceptable range.  Used to increase service volume (reception area) or raise power to overcome losses in transmissi on lines. Tone-Remote Console 4 Line (Radio Remote Control Console):  A radio control device which uses tones to control radio base stations and repeater equipment.  Consoles provide audio amplification and line impedance matching capabilities.  Unit is capable of c ontrolling multiple radios using matched tone controlled units remotely located.   3.0	BACKGROUND  McNary Dam is in the process of replacing the installed radio equipment.  The transmitter combiner combines the output of the new transmitters to the Emergency Notification System (ENS) distributed antenna system that is currently installed at McNary.  Wi thout this device a new distributed antenna system would be required.   The new installation requires additional lightning protection and coaxial cable grounding which was not required for previous installa tions.  The output power of the new transmitter is insufficient allow to power the distributed antenna system without additional amplification.  Currently installed tone control equipment is obsolete and is no longer supported by the manufacturer.   4.0	GENERAL 4.1	GENERAL INFORMATION 4.1.1	This section covers the purchase of electronics equipment to support new radio installations at McNary Dam.

The US Army Corps of Engineers Engineering Research and Development Center, Field Research Facility at D uck, North Carolina has a requirement for a phase measuring (interferometric) bathymetric survey system for surveying in shallow coastal ocean, estuarine, and river environments.  The primary use will be in coastal waters to study changes in the beach/near shore profile.  Because the water is shallow (less than 15 m); the changes large or, more usually, small (less than 10 cm); and there are limited weather windows in which to operate;  a system capable of wide swath coverage, high vertical accuracy, and rap id survey speed is required.  A complete, turn-key system is required that includes everything necessary to conduct an interferometric survey.  This includes (but is not limited to): computers, cables, mounts, transducers, inertial measurement unit, data c ollection and processing software. The system must be compatible with, and able to interface to: 	1) Coastal Oceanographic's Hypack Max Hysweep; 	2) Trimble 5700 RTK DGPS positioning system (Real Time Kinematic Differential Global Positioning System).

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure licenses to access the Federal Marine Fisheries Regulations Coast Guard wide from the period of performance of  01 September 2006 to 31 August 2007.  This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Therefore, please read this entire notice, the instructions herein, and the attachment documents carefully.  This acquisition is on a(n) Small business set aside basis.  SCOPE: Statement of Work

Major Tasks:  

1. Supplier agrees to provide Federal Marine Fisheries Regulations to the United States Coast Guard (USCG), for the period of 1 September 2006 through 31 August 2007.  These regulations will be utilized by fisheries boarding officers, aircraft commanders and operations oversight personnel to enforce federal fisheries regulations at-sea and on the dock.  Key requirements of these regulations are that:

a. They must be clearly organized and formatted to provide quick and easy access for enforcement personnel to the appropriate section of the regulations.  As many sections of the regulations reference other sections, section references should be clearly linked for quicker reference by enforcement personnel. For the period from 1 September 2006 through 31 August 2007, the irrevocable, non-exclusive right to use, store, reproduce in any medium, or transmit in any form or by any means, all the data and updates (deliverables) described in this SOW; supplier retains the right to sell or otherwise market to any other entity or individual the data and service covered by this SOW.

b. They must be kept up-to-date with updates provided to the Coast Guard on a regular basis, at a minimum monthly.

c. They must contain all appropriate parts of Titles 15, 46 (Part 28 only) and 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations that are enforced by the Coast Guard.  Current regulations being provided include 50 CFR 216, 222, 223, 224, 226, 229, 230, 300, 403, 600, 622, 635, 640, 648, 654, 660, 679, and 697; 15 CFR 904 and 922; 46 CFR 28 and the Lacey Act, 16 USC 3371-3378.

d. They must be provided in electronic .chm format, windows CE and Palm format.  The supplier should be able to provide at the request of field units a paper copy of all or portions of these regulations—excluding regulations applicable to the U.S. west coast—in the form of its Books GEN, ADM, NE/MA, and SA/C/G, paid for by the requesting units at a cost in addition to this contract.  Paper copy service should also include a monthly update feature.

The USCG will ensure that the data provided to it under this agreement, in whatever form, is protected from use by anyone outside the Coast Guard.  Excerpts from the regulations will be allowed to be used by the Coast Guard for inclusion in law enforcement case packages and other official purposes, whereby the information will be transferred outside the Coast Guard.

2. In addition, supplier will maintain the existing Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) regulated areas database.  This database consolidates all the geographically defined regulatory areas in the federal marine fisheries regulations into one Excel file so that these areas may be imported into Coast Guard command and control systems.  Supplier will need to provide all areas that are promulgated as final regulations, provided that can be done on the basis of the regulatory text, plus use of MapTech software for the sole purpose of creating latitude and longitude points for land intersections described in the regulations.  For this purpose, the USCG will provide the supplier with MapTech software program and data disks.  Updates must be provided on a regular basis, at a minimum monthly.  VMS updates should be formatted identically to that being used at present (Microsoft Excel spreadsheets), and updated files will be transmitted via e-mail.

3. Advance Payment Provision:  Due to automatic upgrades/updates throughout the performance period, advance payment is authorized under attached FAR 52.232-12.

<DESC>This is Amendment No. 002 to combined synopsis/solicitation number HSFEMW-06-Q-0037 for a Regional Satellite System. Amendment 002 makes the following changes:  (1) Revised Statement of Work. Questions and Answers and due date will be included in amendment No. 003.

(1)   REVISED STATEMENT OF WORK:
BACKGROUND
FEMA’s mission encompasses the centralized direction of emergency management in both peacetime and war, for emergencies ranging from natural disasters to nuclear war.  FEMA carries out its responsibilities through a field organization of ten Regional Offices, five Federal Regional Centers, the Mt. Weather Emergency Assistance Center (MWEAC), the National Emergency Training Center (NETC), Washington DC, the Olney Federal Support Center and fixed disaster processing sites.

Currently, the ten Regional Offices have little or no backup communications capabilities to remotely operate voice and data.  Some facilities use HF radio for backup communications.  However, this only provides a very limited capability and should only be used as a last resort.  During the 9/11 event, FEMA’s Region II, New York, facility lost all communications and functioned by removing window filming and utilizing several single channel satellite telephones.  This provided no data capability and very poor voice quality seriously hampering response efforts.  The Regional Offices need backup communications that is extremely small and portable which would allow them to also be relocated to a COOP or disaster facility.  They also require systems requiring minimal technical skill for setup and operation.  Satellite communications will be an essential back-up means in the event that landlines, cellular towers and even HF radio become inoperable.

It is the government’s desire to have a single solution providing telephone and secure encrypted Internet service with TCP acceleration for the Regional Offices.  The current network ground entry point is PanAmSat’s Atlanta teleport, located in Ellenwood, GA and is connected via a private link to FEMA Region IV headquarters.

2.  GENERAL
2.1	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

A.	Provide Ku satellite communications link into the FEMA infrastructure for sixteen to twenty four voice and sixteen to twenty four data connections.
B.	VoIP is acceptable solution between remote satellite system and the Atlanta, GA Regional Office.
C.	TCP acceleration is required for VoIP link.
D.	TCP encryption required at AES or 3DES.
E.	The satellite system must be small, light weight and portable, to be transported in Suburban or van type vehicle.
F.	System should not exceed 150 pounds per case.
G.	Multiple transit cases are acceptable.
H.	Satellite system set up time must be less than 2 hours from time of arrival on site, to being fully operational with both voice and data.
I.	The ground entry point to FEMA is currently Atlanta, Georgia in the Region IV Office.
J.	Current Earth Station is PanAmSat Ellenwood facility.
K.	Current contracted satellite space is on Horizon 1 and all horizontal polarization.
L.	Systems must fully auto acquire a preprogrammed satellite.
M.	Systems must be shock mounted for transport.
N.	System will operate on dedicated satellite space only.
O.	All units must be capable of operating with 98% uptime for voice, data, and fax for extended periods.
P.	A UPS must be provided to maintain system for five to ten minutes without an electrical power source.

2.2	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
The period of performance shall begin upon the contractor’s receipt of the purchase order or contract award notification.  Systems delivery and government testing is anticipated to be no later than 120 days from award for the first system. A phased approach for the remaining nine systems will require delivery and testing for one system every ten working days after acceptance of the first system and will be delivered to each of the regional offices.  Total period of performance is 210 days. Respondents are required to submit meter and SSPA output power. 
Remote satellite antenna is to be no larger than 1.2 meter with 4 watt BUC, smaller antenna will have minimum of 8 watt BUC.  Reference 4.1 F of the revised SOW.
17.  What satellite's) will the system operate over?
Reference answer to question number 1.
18. What link availability is required to maintain operation “through extreme weather conditions” 
Revised SOW removed this requirement and lists BUC minimums. Reference 4.1 E of revised SOW.
19. Do the existing SDM300A modems have the Turbo Codec option installed? 
Modems to be specified by the respondent for system recommended to meet mission requirements of voice and data. Reference 4.2 O of revised SOW.
20.  What is the maximum data rate a remote site will be required to uplink? 
Reference answer to question number 4.
 21.  In regard to the existing entry point at the MWEOC:  
Revised SOW addresses the current entry point into FEMA as being the Atlanta, GA, Region IV Office.
22. What is the size of satellite antenna? 
The size is .75 to 1.2 meter range.  Reference 4.1 A of revised SOW.
23.  Is there automatic uplink power control? 
Uplink power control is required for setup only. Reference 4.2 of the revised SOW.
24. The Solicitation references “… and full motion 36MHz video transmissions”.   Is there a requirement to TX or receive said video by each of the 10 remotes? 
Revised SOW removed the requirement for any video.
25. Is there any equipment required to be installed at the existing 2 sites as part of this solicitation? 
Revised SOW addresses the need for modems to be purchased, installed and integrated into current PanAmSat facility. 
26. Define the equipment with manufacture and part numbers for the voice order-wire system (Modulator, demodulator and push-to-talk audio components). 
Revised SOW removed the order-wire system from the requirements.
27.  Reference Paragraph 3.1.2, “System will support a minimum of 24 Data and 24 Voice simultaneous connections”.  Since the equipment at the transportable terminal must be compatible to same at the existing hub:   
Revised SOW addresses the voice and data requirement. Reference 4.2 O of revised SOW.
28. What is the demarcation point of the terminal:  T1 G.703, or 24 data ports + 24 voice ports? 
Demark at FEMA Region IV Office in Atlanta, GA, into one of the 50 Tunnel UDGateway units.
Reference 3.1 C of revised SOW.
29. If not G.703, then what multiplexer is in use at the MWEOC that will aggregate the minimum 24 data connections, plus 24 voice connections onto a since data stream for connection to the SDM300A satellite modem 
See answer to question 28. 
 

30. Reference 3.2.5 Voice Order-wire.  On-Call Communications is a competing prime system integrator contractor. Microphase manufactures the specified audio analog modulator (MP-1040/Option16) and demodulator MP-2030/Option16.    What equipment or value added service does On-Call Communications provide to the voice order-wire / 70MHz subsystem that a different prime contractor can provide without going to On-Call Communications for? 
Reference answer to question 26.
  31. Reference 3.2.5 Voice Order-wire.  “This system must be remote capable to our NNOC via copper or fiber”  
Reference answer to question 26.
32. What is “NNOC” 
FEMA's National Network Operations Center.
33. Is there one for each transportable system? 
Revised SOW removed this requirement.
34. What is the distance that is required to be remoted by copper? 
Antenna system to electronic indoor cases is minimum of 100 feet and from indoor cases to data laptop positions and analog voice positions is 25 feet. Reference 4.2 J and L of revised SOW.
35.  Must all 10 systems be ready in 90 days of award, or just the first? 
Period of Performance has been revised in the SOW which includes testing. Reference 2.2.
36.  Can the due date of the proposal be extended until 2 weeks after the answers are provided in order to allow for sufficient time to perform link budget calculations? 
See revised due date as part of this amendment.
37. How many satellite terminals are required in each of the 10 regions and what the total number of required satellite terminals is?
One terminal per Regional Office totaling ten units. Reference revised SOW.
38.  Please provide the maximum allowable distance of the antenna subsystem from the remote communication shelter.
Minimum distance is 100 feet, no maximum. Reference 4.2 L of revised SOW.
39. Can you confirm that this is a “STAR” satellite network requirement?
Point to point network. Reference in revised SOW as ground entry point. Reference 2.1 I.
40. Could you clarify if the solicitation includes the satellite service.  I read it to understand that the solicitation only covers the 10 terminals and other equipment.  However, I did want to confirm that the service was not included.  I would expect that the new terminals would use the existing service. 
Satellite service is not included in this RFQ.
41. Is the use of the MicroPhase MP-2030/Option 16 and MP-1040/Option 16 a hard requirement.  If possible, we want to suggest an alternative.  The MicroPhase order wire system's) pass voice user traffic in the clear; very easy for the press and the public to monitor sensitive FEMA conversations. Can we recommend and alternative?
Revised SOW removed this requirement.
42. Will a tailored (pull behind trailer) version that carries all the specifications and equipment suffice as this bid, as long as it meets the OSHA two-man lift and wind criteria?
Revised SOW addresses the requirement to have all transportable by van or suburban.  Reference 2.1 E of revised SOW.


43. Is the bandwidth on the satellite already paid for?  Does this need to be added to the bid?
Not required for this procurement.
44. Do you have the PDF or spec sheets for all the equipment specified?  Is the Comtech, and other equipment specified GFE?
Revised  SOW defines what is required by contractor and what government will provide.
45. What VoIP connectivity provider would be used? 
A VoIP solution is acceptable for the link between the remote site and the FEMA Atlanta, GA Regional Office only.  Reference 2.1.B of the revised SOW.
46. What about SIP, VoIP phones? Would these be needed for this set-up, and would they be GFE?
Voice instruments are to be analog slim line sets only. Reference 4.3  I of revised SOW.
47. If it would take 90 days for the first unit tests, then what timeline is expected for the other units?
Revised SOW addresses delivery requirements.   Reference 2.2 of the revised SOW.
48. Para. 3.1.1 specifies a T1 transmission rate (e.g. 1.544 Mbps).  Para 3.2.2.1B states BUC must be able to power through extreme weather conditions.  This statement is subjective, and so cannot be used to determine BUC power requirements.  In order to determine the BUC power requirements an objective criteria is needed. This can be stated in any of 3 ways: (1) Specification on the maximum EIRP of the terminal under any weather conditions, or (2) Specification on the minimum uplink margin beyond that which is needed under clear sky conditions, or (3) Specification on the required link % availability.
Revised SOW addresses remote satellite antenna is to be no larger than 1.2 meter with 4 watt BUC, smaller antenna will have minimum of 8 watt BUC.  Reference 4.1 E of revised SOW.
49. Para. 3.2.4A specifies a 1:7 modem system.  If a single T1 is required per para. 3.1.1, then a single modem or 1:1 redundant modem system seems more appropriate.  Please clarify.
Revised SOW describes two modems required for each system, one with system and matching modem to install in earth station. Reference 4.2 C of revised SOW.
50. Para. 3.2.5A requires a voice order wire system.  The last sentence states the system must be remote capable to our NNOC via copper or fiber.   Is this applicable to the remote terminal.  It would appear this NNOC is only located at Mt. Weather.  As such, this requirement is not applicable for the 10 systems being procured.
Revised  SOW removed this requirement.
51. Para 3.2.5 specifies On-Call model numbers for voice order wire.  Are these part numbers for the hub or 10 remote terminal systems?
Revised SOW removed this requirement.
52. Para 3.3.1 states the government will provide fiber and copper connections to each shelter.  This system does not include a shelter.  The modem and base band equipment is provided in transit cases.  The demark for the terminal is the transit case's).  All government connections/interfaces are to these cases.  Please clarify.
Revised SOW removed this requirement and added the corrected wording.
53. Para. 3.3.1 requests a Monitor and Control System with software and drivers.  Will the contractor supply a laptop computer or is this GFE?
Revised SOW removed this requirement.
54.  As a small business that meets the NAICS code requirement we intend to propose our solution and price as a prime contractor for this RFQ.  In performance of this effort we intend to use another small company to help with some of the integration effort.  Is it permitted to use past performance from that company to help meet the requirements to provide five recent sources that can verify performance of similar items of comparable dollar value?
In accordance with the evaluation factors, recommend you provide adequate information for the Government to evaluate your proposal.
55. This opportunity is designated Set-Aside for Total Small Business, does this mean that all members of a small business team (Prime and Subcontractors) must meet the small business size standard of 13.5M?
The prime contractor must meet the Small Business Administration (SBA) requirements.
56. Can the NAICS code be changed to 334220 (750 employees) vice 517410 ($13.5M)? This would open the opportunity to more qualified providers and provide a better selection of satellite equipment.
No.  The NAICS code was selected because it best meets this requirement.
57.  My company is a small business; however our annual revenues are more than the 13.5 million standard you specify in your RFQ.  Could you please let me know if our company would be considered a viable bidder?
Your local Small Business Administration office can provide you their guidance as to your small business status and eligibility for award.
(2) EXTENSION DUE DATE:  DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF QUOTES IS EXTENDED TO AUGUST  18, 2006, 4:30PM, LOCAL TIME. NO MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WILL BE ENTERTAINED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>Amendment 0001
Combined Synopsis/Solicitation RA1341-06-RP-0211

This Amendment provides questions received and responses provided by the Government.  It is provided for clarification and informational purposes only.  The due date for proposals is not extended as a result of this amendment.

Q1.	Will there be house water available to help cool this system?  

R1.	There will be approximately  20C house chilled water available.

Q2. 	On the system description, 2. Load-Lock chamber, d. it states that “an expansion port for diagnostic purposes” is desired.  It is not clear exactly what is being requested here.  Can we get some more specific clarification on this?

R2.	An extra 2.75” CF port for the attachment of, for example, an RGA.

Q.3	On system description 4. Gas Handling b. it states “Data shall be provided in proposals to support the quoted uniformity.”  We usually support this by running samples for the customer so they can inspect the samples for themselves and verify the results.  Is there some other means of supporting this other than stating that we can and have met this uniformity spec and we are glad to guarantee it?  Or would you like to send us samples so we can demonstrate that we meet this uniformity spec?  Please clarify what is needed here and we will gladly provide it.

R3.	Any previous data from other tools of yours will suffice.   The Government would like to see something like a plot of etch rate vs. radius of wafer for some standard etch process.  

Q4. 	On system description 5 Etching performance, it states "Data shall be provided in proposals for two baseline processes on this system which simultaneously meeting the following criteria", and it goes on to enumerate some process specs. I want to ensure I fully understand what is being requested: are you asking to provide our processes for etching these 2 materials? We can meet these requirements and can provide our processes, but we don't usually give out our processes unless the customer is purchasing a system from us. Unfortunately, we have had it occur where we gave a process away to a potential customer, who then went and purchased a less expensive system from a company that offered no process support, and they just took the process that we had developed and put it in the other system; as you can imagine, this gave us some misgivings about giving out our proprietary processes without a PO.  Be that as it may, please clarify exactly what you would like us to provide and we will provide it.

R4.	The Government does not need the specifics of the process (i.e. gasses, flows, pressures, powers), but it does need to know that the tools it is buying will be able to perform these processes.  If the etching data is supplied with the processes denoted by "Process A", "B", etc., this will suffice.  However, if the Government buys the tool, it expects that these processes will be fully disclosed.

Q5.	Lastly, on system description 7. Wafer handling, d. it states "for a 5 minute, 200W etch, the substrate temperature shall not exceed 60C. Data shall be provided that confirms this."  We can measure this and state that we can do it, but is that the confirmation that you want?  More accurate verification on this point is already built into the acceptance spec, which states that "Final payment will not be made until the system has passed all the tests performed at the government site."  Again, please let us know what you would like us to present you and we will do so.

R5.	Please measure and report a temperature for such a process.  The Government accepts any data given in a proposal.  We will measure this during the acceptance procedure and if the system does not meet this, it will not be accepted.

<DESC>Restrictions: This is modification 0002 to a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitut es the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number W91248-06-Q-0050 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are tho se in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-06, dated 08 June 05. NAICS is 541330; business size is $4.5M; acquisition is 100% setaside for HUBZone business. Modification 0002  Closing date is changed to read:  18 Aug 2006, 10:00 AM.  Modification is issued to answer the following questions:  Question 1:  We are asking the government to consider the extensive experience of our candidate and his ability to obta in the national certification as being Technically Acceptable for the proposal effort.  He has been studying for the ICC exam since the Market Survey was posted and is trying to schedule the testing for this week.  The government is allowing 30 days after notice to proceed for the candidate to obtain the State Certifications would it be acceptable to allow this same time frame for the ICC Certification to be acquired? Answer 1:  The government will allow 30-days after notice to proceed for the candidate to obtain the ICC Certification.  Question2:  The RFQ states the government is only going to pay for actual hours worked, but goes on to instruct offerors to bid 2,000 hrs.  We are requesting clarification of both statements.  Typically, we bid Productive Ho urs, and in this case would equate to the base of 2,080 hours minus 80 hours of Federal holidays and 120 hours of Personal Time Off (vacation and sick leave). Please clarify what hours are expected to be bid.  Answer 2:  The government will only pay for a ctual hours worked.  Estimated at 2,000 hours, submit per hour rate.  Question 3:  The Statement of Work references the need for two Electrical Inspectors to accomplish the task, however pricing only reflects one individual.  Can the government clarify the se statements?  Answer 3:  There are 2 Line Items with hours for Electrical Inspectors;  Line Item 0001 and Line Item 0003.  Contractor will be paid for actual hours worked (See paragraph 7 of the SOW).  Question 4:  In the Statement of Work, Sections 4.0 Government Furnished Property and Equipment and 5.0 Contractor Furnished Property and Equipment does not mention a computer.  We request clarification if a computer is going to be furnished by the government or if it is required to be priced by offerors. Also, if it is going to be Contractor Furnished, what are the configuration requirements of the installation DOIM for connectivity to the Fort Campbell LAN?  Answer 4:  Government Furnished Property and Equipment including computers will be provided.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.  All responsible concerns may submit a quote that will be considered by this agency.  Facsimile quotations are acceptable at (270) 798-3987; mailing address is Directorate of Contracting, 13 ½ Street, Building 2 176, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, ATTN: Tracy Mueller or Angela Jacobs.

Yes, the government estimates 65 audiometric tests for soldiers not requiring a full physical.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 02- THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FULLY REPLACES SOLICITATION POSTED ON JULY 13, 2006.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for items being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire the following: 1. 5/16”torque balanced Vectran rope, orange in color, jacketed with proprietary positive relief, vortex shearing plastic jacket quantity of 4 each Rope, 2000 meters  2.  Splice and install with NOAA provided thimbles with poured devcon boot as strain relief  1000 meters quantity of 4 each, 500 meters quantity of 4 each, 300 meters quantity of 4 each,  and 100 meters quantity of 6 each. This rope is to be manufactured of Vectran, in a torque balanced 12 strand construction.  The rope will have a nominal diameter of ¼” and a minimum breaking strength of 4,000 pounds. This minimum breaking strength includes the factory installed splices at each end of each segment of rope.  The Vectran shall be covered with an extruded, green, PE jacket with the profile shown on the accompanying drawing.   The six parallel raised ribs on the jacket shall rotate about the axis of the rope clockwise for 360 degrees in ½ meter, then counterclockwise for 360 degrees in ½ meter, repeating the pairs of right and left rotations for the length of the rope. (+- 45 degrees in each direction for both the right and left rotations, and repeatable every one meter +-15%.) Solid plastic thimbles shall be supplied to the vendor by NOAA.  These are the only thimbles which will be acceptable. The eye splice and thimble shall be encased in Devcon 90 durometer potting compound, or equivalent. The boot shall extend up the rope for approximately 14” and have an approximate diameter tapering from 1” to 5/8”.  Appropriate compounds and techniques should be used to ensure the adhesion of the Devcon to the PE jacket of the rope. The purpose of the boot is to stiffen the juncture of the Vectran and the thimble to the point of rigidity, and to distribute the forces within the Vectran as the thimble travels over a block, under load. The boot should be applied while the eye and adjacent Vectran are under some tension, say 200D squared.  Each booted eye splice shall be proof tested to 50% of MBS.  A certificate of testing shall accompany the delivery.  In addition, a total of two test splices, applied with the same technique used in all the splices, complete with boot, shall be pulled to 50% MBS a total of 10 times and then pulled to destruction.  The final breaking force shall not be less than 4,000 pounds.  These tests shall be preformed on a certified test bed and the certified stress/strain results presented to PMEL prior to the shipping of the product. Drawing and photograph of finished product are available upon request. Items will be shipped using government bill of lading, must be delivered to Seattle WA by Nov 11, 2006. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Only firms that can provide the exact items described herein will be considered. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication.
