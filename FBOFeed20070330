<DESC>The Judicial Administrative and Management Reform Project (JAMR) is designed as a four-year, $3-4 million activity.  It is an intervention to support and move the judiciary to become an independent yet equal branch of government through a comprehensive program for improved court administration and case management throughout all the courts of Georgia including the 46 magistrate courts.  Based on the Georgian judicial leadership’s commitment to and provision of resources for judicial reform, the overwhelming need for improved court administration and case management will be addressed by a comprehensive program to: 

-improve the quality and timeliness of judicial decision making since court administrative and management issues will be delegated to court administrative staff;

-improve court practices by providing the technical assistance necessary for the court administrative staff to process cases in a timely and efficient manner;

-train the judiciary to formulate and manage the courts’ budget;

-improve public access, services, uses and understanding of the courts and their facilities.  

In addition, the existing information technology system now being used in the courts will be examined for adequacy according to international standards and improved as necessary to meet the needs of the Georgian reality, building on the work of earlier projects, especially the World Bank judicial reform project.

The principal Government of Georgia (GoG) counterpart will be the Supreme Court of Georgia, the High Council of Justice (HCoJ) and all courts:  the 20 enlarged first instance courts; 2 appeals court; and, the 46 magistrate courts.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to the Bangkok Tenofivir Study Group on a cost only (no fee) basis. The Bangkok Tenofovir Study (BTS) is a Phase II/III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of tenofovir, administered once daily to HIV-1 uninfected Intravenous Drug Users in Bangkok Thailand. The study is designed to determine if daily tenofovir will prevent HIV-1 infection among IDUs and if tenofovir is safe to use among HIV-uninfected IDUs. The purpose of this contract is to continue the study initiated under an existing contract with the Bangkok Tenofovir Study Group (contract 200-2004-09965) to allow an increase in study cohort size, and an extension of participant follow up.  BTS is designed to determine if daily tenofovir will prevent HIV-1 infection among IDUs and if tenofovir is safe to use among HIV-uninfected IDUs. This is a Phase II/III randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study of the safety and efficacy of tenofovir, administered once daily to HIV-1 uninfected IDUs. HIV-uninfected IDUs (N=2,000) will be randomized to receive either tenofovir 300 mg daily (N=1000) or placebo (N=1000). Participants will be involved in the study until the last enrollee completes 12 months on study, with an expected contract period from June 2007 through December 2008.  For continuation and consistency of this research it is imperative to utilize BTSG for this follow-on contract.  BTSG’s ability to continue their work will prevent this trial from ending prematurely or will prevent CDC from having to start this research project from the beginning.   The North American Industry Classification Code is 541710.  Note 22.

The Contractor responsibilities will involve (but are not limited to) the following: •Assist CCC NASA SE&I in providing the initial design, data architecture, data relationship descriptions and documentation for the Proof of Concept development phase of the Launch Site Command and Control System (LSCCS). •Assist CCC NASA SE&I in providing the initial Test Build Configuration Definition and documentation for the Proof of Concept development phase. •Assist CCC NASA SE&I in providing the initial Application Build and High-Level Domain Specific Language (DSL) support for the off-line build products for the Proof of Concept development phase.   Provide the initial design of the LSCCS Information Architecture for: oVehicle data-links  oGround Support Equipment (GSE) Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) oGSE end-items oKSC-unique data links  oInternal usage data for the LSCCS set (i.e. common services, System Management and Control (SMC) applications, simulation, and hardware Platforms  oExternal interfaces from the LSCCS set to other Constellation Mission Sites. General activities includes providing: o Support to Constellation Architecture (C3I)  Information Architecture telecons, and reviews.  o Support in the identification and resolution Information Architecture issues o Support in the identification and mitigation of Information Architecture related risks and issues within the findings and white papers that result from the Proof of Concept activity. NASA/KSC intends to acquire these services from NetLander Inc  without full and open competition as permitted pursuant to FAR 13.106 (b) and 10 U.S.C, 2304 (c) (1) for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source. This effort is being sole-sourced to NetLander Inc. based on the expertise of its Principal Partner.  This specialized knowledge, unique expertise, and prior experience makes NetLander the only vendor capable of successfully completing this effort.  The tasks relating to this effort require an extensive, senior-level knowledge of the custom, legacy KSC Shuttle database systems as well as current architectures, standards, tools and techniques.  NetLander’s Principal Partner was one of the key creators of the legacy KSC DBSafe system that supports Shuttle LPS operations today. This legacy system is one of the chief areas required for the design of the LSCCS Information Architecture. As a creator of the system, NetLander’s Principal Partner is uniquely qualified to support KSC Engineering Office.   NetLander's Principal Partner has unique senior-level experience that provides the following to this project:  •Detailed knowledge of the Shuttle DBSAFE Test Build process.   •Knowledge of irregularities, essential services, and causes of losses in efficiencies of the legacy LPS system. •Knowledge of the Shuttle DBSAFE architecture and detailed implementation. •Experience with the Test Build architecture, detailed implementation, and Build flow.	 •His experience with these legacy systems, as well as, other systems has allowed him to develop the required deep mission support awareness for resolution of issues that might impact a launch flow. He also provides the essential skills required for tools existing in the current industry domain, for example: •He is skilled with multiple industry databases including Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL.   •He is capable of providing implementation solutions on multiple platforms based upon his background in current Windows Server and Linux Server platforms.  Provides  awareness of current world wide web consortium standards for ontology management  •The application of his background for current LSCCS Information Architecture design concepts is essential for KSC to implement the new system without expending additional ‘learning curve’ time.  In addition, this noncompetitive acquisition is also based on the need for a rapid transition.  There is an immediate need for this skill set and knowledge to ensure a successful Information Architecture design for the new launch system. Knowledgeable people in this area are limited due to the legacy experience demands concurrent with the necessity for knowledge of current industry standards and tools.   Due to the currently ongoing LSCCS design activities, development of the required knowledge and skill set is not feasible.  NetLander’s Principal Partner is currently available through Netlander Inc. which has the capability to quickly meet the immediate information architectural engineering services required to ensure LSCCS success with ongoing design phases.  This initial phase sole-source procurement will provide the capability for LSCCS to meet critical near-term design objectives for the initial Information Architecture design.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April, 06, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The objective of the PhASER program is to develop a fundamental photonic integrated circuit (PIC), termed Unit Cell, which can act as a reconfigurable building block in the formation of a high-throughput, low-power, analog signal processor.  The intent of this program is to enable scalable PIC-based analog signal processors that overcome the limits of conventional Silicon-based digital signal processing technology.  Specific program goals include:

-       Definition of a photonic analog signal-processing engine Unit Cell which is comprised of waveguide-connected, programmable, active photonic elements. These unit cells should enable basic filtering operations on their own or arbitrarily complex filter operations when connected within a large array of Unit Cells;
-	Development of a program plan that will permit the fabrication, testing, and evaluation of the Unit Cell;
-	Description of how the Unit Cell, when arrayed within a high-density PIC, will scale and meet the PhASER filter challenge problem, as well as how the Unit Cells will be programmed and tested at the chip-level to ensure high yield;  
-	Development of a filter synthesis tool to demonstrate how Unit Cells will perform in the context of generalized high-order filters.
-	Implementation of a technical approach to experimentally demonstrate the Unit Cell performance milestones; 

DARPA may consider compelling proposals with highly innovative technical approaches that fall short of the above program goals. Those offering such proposals should provide unambiguous physical arguments, based on data, simulations, and calculations, leading to estimates of practical and fundamental performance limits in operational parameters of the envisioned PhASER.

The PhASER program will consist of a single phase whose focus is on the development and demonstration of the PhASER Unit Cell.  Proposers must define a realistic schedule and budget to meet the milestone and deliverable schedule.  It is recommended that the proposed program plan include interim milestones at approximately the halfway point of the program.  Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:

I. Demonstration of photonic filtering technology; 
II. Filter Algorithms; 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 07-17 Proposer Information Pamphlet referred below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Photonic Analog Signal-Processing Engines with Reconfigurability (PhASER) program will consist of a single phase whose focus is on the development and demonstration of the PhASER Unit Cell.  Supporting tasks will include the development and demonstration of a filter synthesis software tool, and a related transition plan.  Proposers must define a realistic schedule and budget to meet the milestone and deliverable schedule.  It is recommended that the proposed program plan include interim milestones at approximately the halfway point of the program. Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming including different expertise such as, but not limited to: photonic and electronic device design, fabrication, and packaging; filter design and integration; and military sensor processing system analysis are strongly encouraged.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Michael Haney, phone: (571) 218-4813, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: Mike.Haney@darpa.mil.

A Proposer?s Questions, website will be posted for BAA 07-17 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto).  If you would like to have a question answered and posted on this site, please send your question to the following address: BAA07-17@darpa.mil.
  
GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 07-17, Photonic Analog Signal-Processing Engines with Reconfigurability (PhASER), Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/,World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. 

 In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  The proposal abstract must be submitted to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa on 27 February 2007.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposal abstracts should not be submitted via www.grants.gov.  

Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit a full proposal to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa, or via www.grants.gov for Universities wishing to use the "Apply" function, on or before 23 April 2007 in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.gov.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 07-17, Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as ?Government Only?.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations? participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in integrated photonics.

<SOLNBR>N-A
<RESPDATE>051007

<CONTACT>Jason C Crusan, IR&D and Technology Development Investment Analyst, Phone 202-358-0635, Fax 202-358-3530, Email jason.c.crusan@nasa.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION Since the first Space Shuttle Program’s Return to Flight (RTF) mission (STS-114), NASA has used delivered streaming video coverage via the NASA Web Portal in partnership with several companies to meet public demand to see the launches and missions.  NASA’s primary method for disseminating content is via the NASA Web Portal (www.nasa.gov).  During those missions we have seen peak internet users of greater than 438,000 accessing NASA TV coverage via web streaming.  These partnerships have enabled NASA to disseminate our content to a much wider audience than we would have been capable of our own.   In the existing portal infrastructure without our delivery partners, NASA may have to cap the number of visitors and hours of web streaming coverage.  This would force visitors to find content from other venues that may or may not cover the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) and the International Space Station Program (ISS) missions and expeditions. NASA is releasing this announcement to solicit in-kind proposals for web video streaming infrastructure and bandwidth services from non-NASA entities to support increased public access to NASA missions at no cost to NASA. NASA intends to enter into a Space Act Agreement with the selected sponsor(s) to cover this support.  NASA and the NASA Web Portal contractor will handle the integration of the selected sponsor’s(s’) in-kind solution with support from the sponsor(s). NASA is seeking an Agreement that will take effect June 1, 2007, and last through the end of the Space Shuttle Program currently ending on September 30, 2010.  In addition to the SSP and ISS missions, NASA currently has many missions and events during this time period that would drive visitor levels to the site higher: launches of robotic spacecraft missions, such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and test launches of the ARES-1 launch vehicle, and many other announcements covered by NASA TV.  In addition, at the end of the Agreement term, and if mutually agreeable to the selected sponsor(s), NASA may seek options for extension under this Agreement.  In exchange for this sponsorship, NASA will consider offers to display the logo of the sponsor(s) and give credit to the sponsor(s) on the NASA Web Portal.  NASA will consider other suitable, innovative concepts to acknowledge and publicize the Offeror’s sponsorship.	 This Announcement is open through May 10, 2007.   NASA will not issue paper copies of this announcement.	NASA reserves the right to select for Space Act Agreement all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NASA provides no funding for reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Material submitted in response to this Announcement will not be returned.  It is the policy of NASA to safeguard all proposals as confidential and privileged information and NASA will not, without permission of the Offeror, use or disclose their contents for other than evaluation purposes.  I.	GENERAL INFORMATION Agency Name: NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Sponsorship Opportunity Title:	Web Based Video Streaming for NASA TV including the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) and International Space Station (ISS) Mission Coverage Response Date:	Electronic Proposals must be received by May 10, 2007 at 4:30 P.M. EST via email to jason.c.crusan@nasa.gov Points of Contact:   Mr. Jason C. Crusan   Telephone: (202) 358-0635	 Email: jason.c.crusan@nasa.gov Instrument Type(s):  It is anticipated that awards under this Announcement will be in the form of Space Act Agreements, executed under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(5) and (6). Evaluation Panel:  Government personnel from NASA, other Federal agencies, and NASA contractors may participate in the evaluation of proposals.  All government and contractor personnel participating in the evaluation will be bound by conflict of interest provisions and appropriate non-disclosure requirements to protect proprietary information. Award Date:  Selection is anticipated by June 1, 2007.	 Submission Instructions: All Proposals under this Announcement must be emailed to jason.c.crusan@nasa.gov. Paper submissions will not be reviewed.  Proposal submission may be at any time before the response date.  You are encouraged to submit as early as practicable during this time period.  Proposals received by the Government after the response date and time may not be accepted, at the Government’s discretion.  If Offeror is concerned about information security during transmission NASA has the ability to accept secure transmission.  Contact the Point of Contact for secure transmission requirements.  Files can be submitted in MS Word, PDF, or RTF. II.	ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION 1.	Eligible Applicants All categories of non-NASA U.S. institutions are eligible to submit proposals in response to this Announcement. 2.	Foreign Participation NASA is not accepting proposals from foreign entities.	 III.	EVALUATION INFORMATION 1.	Basis for Award Best overall considering the specified evaluation criteria and weighting.  NASA reserves the right to suggest collaboration between Offerors where it will enhance the effort, in which case an Offeror will be given the opportunity to accept or decline participation with other Offerors prior to award.  Only proposals of an in-kind nature will be considered. 2.	Evaluation Criteria 	The factors below are of equal importance. 	Factor 1:  Quality and Appropriateness of the Proposed Effort: The overall merit, rationale, and suitability of the proposed sponsorship approach or concept and its relevance to NASA’s mission.  Highest priority will be placed on an approach or concept that will create a positive image for NASA. 	Factor 2:  Level of Commitment to Web Video Streaming The demonstrated ability of the Offeror to meet streaming estimates based on past performance.  The commitment of dedicated streaming bandwidth in terms of Gbps peak and base will be evaluated.  The technical infrastructure available to support the peaks created by video streaming will be also considered.  NASA and its partners have seen peaks in excess of 50 Gbps with over 438,000 concurrent users and a total of over 319,000,000 megabytes of total content delivered during a single Space Shuttle Mission.  Consideration will also be given to the ease of interoperability with existing NASA infrastructure and the NASA Web Portal.  Consideration will also be given to creative approaches that increase the dissemination of NASA streaming video content.  Consideration will also be given for accommodation of disabled users and the ability to meet requirements under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. IV.	PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS Page Limitations Title - Total Pages  Proposal Cover Page - 1 Proposal Title Page - 1 Points of Contact   - 1 Proposal Abstract   - 750 words Proposal Detail     - 20 Pages in excess of the page limitations for each section will not be evaluated.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to award a contract to continue the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Youth Study (TEDDY), an ongoing epidemiological study involving international clinical centers which are subcontractors to the DCC. The University of South Florida has served as the DCC for TEDDY since 2002. The goal of TEDDY is identification of infectious agents, dietary factors, or other environmental agents, including psychosocial factors which trigger type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in genetically susceptible individuals or which protect against the disease. Identification of such factors will lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and result in new strategies to prevent, delay or reverse T1DM. Data collection is ongoing from cohorts of newborns from the general population and newborn first-degree relatives of probands with T1DM. Newborns are first identified to be at genetic risk for T1DM before being offered enrollment for long term follow-up. These cohorts are to be followed for 15 years for the appearance of various beta-cell autoantibodies and diabetes, with documentation of early childhood diet, reported and measured infections, vaccinations, and psychosocial stressors. The TEDDY study plans to newly recruit 7,092 subjects, 5,940 neonates from the general population with a pre-determined type 1 diabetes risk of 3% and 1,152 neonates with first degree relatives who have type 1 diabetes and who have a pre-determined type 1 diabetes risk of 10%. The TEDDY study has already recruited a cohort of 2620 patients, including 2361 patients that are from the general population and 259 from the first degree relatives of type 1 diabetes patients. This current group of patients must continue to be followed in the new contract along with the newly recruited subjects to capture previously collected data. The participants will be followed with blood sampling every three months for islet autoantibody measurements until age 4 years and then every six months until the age of 15, for a total of 95,742 samples over the first 5 years of the study and a total of 269,496 over the entire study. 

Ongoing TEDDY assessments include HLA typing, the criteria for enrollment into the study, and analysis of autoantibodies, the primary endpoint of the study. In addition there are follow up visits at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48 months of age, with subsequent visits every six months and blood samples are taken at each visit. The parents collect monthly stool samples in early childhood. The parents fill out questionnaires at regular intervals in connection with visits. TEDDY study personnel complete charts at each visit. The parents record events in the child’s TEDDY Book. Continued long-term follow-up of the currently active TEDDY participants will provide important scientific information on early childhood diet, reported and measured infections, vaccinations, and psychosocial stressors.

The DCC shall provide biostatistical and operational expertise and advice to the clinical centers and the NIDDK and will include the following tasks: 1) Study-Wide Communications, Dissemination of Study Materials, and Related Activities; 2) Data Management and Records Maintenance; 3)Clinic and Central laboratories Monitoring; 4)Data Analyses; 5)Preparation of Study Report and Papers for Publication; 6)Implementation of Procedures to Evaluate Management, Methodology, and Cost-Effectiveness of Procedures Utilized by the DCC; and 7)Periodic Meetings. 

All procedures necessary for data collection, editing, and processing; and for the maintenance of permanent study files and documentation related to the TEDDY database are implemented by the DCC staff as specified in the Internal Procedures Manual and in accordance with HIPAA regulations. The DCC professional and technical staff includes the principal investigator, epidemiologists, database manager, statisticians, programmers, technology and web support, research assistants, nutritionists and administrative specialists, and data entry clerks.

The DCC computing facility must be a self supporting, secure facility comprised of a highly redundant primary server room as well as a secondary Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity facility located at a geographically separate location. All core production systems must include but not be limited to web servers, database servers, e-mail systems and network architecture that are implemented in threes: two redundant systems at the primary data center and a third at the DR facility. The DCC must develop a web application for the TEDDY study which provides for data collection, specimen collection and tracking, subject management, accrual reports, data compliance reports, and TEDDY study staff and committee communications. The architecture of the application must be multi-tiered with separate layers for data access, business logic, and the graphical user interface. This application must communicate with an Oracle database to store all of the TEDDY data. This infrastructure must provide one of the most highly secure and stable platforms available in the industry. 

All the TEDDY study data is transmitted electronically. The DCC receives and processes data from forms completed by Study Coordinators for the participants during the TEDDY clinic visits, the diet records and forms from the nutritionists during TEDDY clinic visits, data from the autoantibody and HLA laboratories and the repositories. The forms and data are sent electronically and transmitted via secure data streams using 128-bite encrypted traffic between the clinical centers, laboratories and the DCC. The web server and database used by the DCC must be located behind dually redundant firewalls. The website and database themselves are password protected. Access to the application and data requires authentication of the logged on user and access to data further depends on the users pre-assigned level of access.

The DCC web collaboration toolset must provide a secure portal where Principal Investigators, Study Coordinators, and other study support staff may post and review documents, announcements, and link to the protocol manager application, training, and other collaboration tools provided by the DCC.

The DCC must develop a data collection and protocol management system that identifies and tracks all events specified in a research protocol. Events include eligibility determination, registration, clinical activities and assessments (e.g., physical exam, medical history), laboratory testing or other investigative procedures, patient self-assessments, and structured patient interviews. A schedule of events specific to the protocol is created for each subject, and the status of each event is tracked for completion status. Additionally, this system must import laboratory and other data, and manage subject events that are dependent upon test results (e.g., laboratory tests that determine eligibility or establish sub-populations requiring additional follow-up). The protocol management system must operate within a secure Web site, where study updates are posted periodically.  Research staff and investigators must be able to access a secure area on the Web site to obtain data views specially designed to aide them in their roles and responsibilities on the study. Views may be limited by study site or role, protecting subject data. The system must incorporate data standards such as SNOMED CT and RxNorm when they exist. This system must enable high data quality. The DCC shall help with the design of the data collection forms (incorporating relevant data standards) with incorporated checks to minimize transcription and omission errors. Regular Quality Assurance reports must be developed that assess data quality post-data entry and there must be interactive data entry validation that enables the correction of data errors at the source of data collection, and limits the need for correcting data at the audit or analysis phases of a study. 

The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) has a significant role in the operation of TEDDY. TEDDY is a complex project that requires extensive amounts of coordination of individuals and organizations that are nationally and internationally based. In addition to coordination of large meetings, the administrative staff is charged with report preparation and travel arrangements. As the accrual target for the study is 220,000 screened and 9,712 followed, the DCC will acquire extensive amounts of data for entry, analysis, reporting and publication. Database development and management is a critical function of the DCC as the volume of materials managed is so vast. Project staff for the Data Coordinating Center is divided into different areas: biostatisticians, epidemiologists, nutritionists, computer programmers, statistical programmers, database engineers and analysts, data managers. The DCC must develop statistical designs for epidemiological studies, development and testing of predictive models for disease progression and provide direct logistical support for their implementation. The DCC is involved in overseeing subcontracting process for reference laboratories and sets policies and procedures for banking samples and data in accordance with the Institutes, Cosponsors and Steering Committee. The DCC must review all manuscripts and abstracts. The biostatisticians must address issues related to multiple end points (e.g., the occurrence of autoantibodies as well as diabetes), the evaluation of surrogate biomarker endpoints and multiple comparisons. The epidemiologists must focus on several proposed studies involving both prospective and/or retrospective case-control designs, as well as genetic and gene-environment interactions and assess the prevalence and incidence of disease-related end point. The epidemiologists must be involved with protocol development, preparation of request of proposals for reference labs and organize the manual of operations. They are responsible for organizing the process by which data is electronically transferred from reference laboratories. They have to FTP, import, and process data from remote laboratories. They are responsible for logging in receipt of data, checking files for reporting and/or transmission errors and reconcile with laboratories. The epidemiologists must answer lab correspondence regarding problem samples, provide extensive phone contact with Clinical Centers (respond to inquiries regarding results, subject status reports, timing of tests/windows, and requests for materials, diagnosis determination, and other protocol related questions). The epidemiologist must assist with management reports, quality control reports and study documentation, prepare reports for project committees and proofread packets being sent to the clinical centers, including Specimen Transmittal Forms, Screening Forms, and various reports. The epidemiologists must assist with preparation of material related to the Institutional Review Board, maintain the IRB approval files from all participating Clinical Centers and their affiliates as appropriate and perform as liaison between IRB and the Principal Investigators. The nutritionist must coordinate collection dietary data from United States and international centers and advice and provide training, as well as perform quality control of the subject interviews and interact widely with the clinical centers and/or clinical investigators to see that protocol compliance meets research standards and remains high. The nutritionist must develop instructions and advice materials for food portion size estimates as well as the adaptation of the questionnaires of the dietary forms for the different languages. The computer programmer must work collaboratively with biostatisticians, scientific investigators, and data managers to design and manage research studies and has to be responsible for database design and development. The computer programmer is responsible for the developing and implementing systems for data entry and database driven webpage development. The programmer must provide the backend server support necessary to maintain the study domain and the system of password controls over data access and supervise the programming staff during the implementation of the TEDDY website, online data collection forms and security procedures. The computer programmer analyst must maintain the Visual Basic/.Net front-end to the Consortium database including daily and weekly automated processes, end-user issues, data flow in and out of database, data integrity and quality control, and database development. The analyst must maintain and update DCC main website as well as DCC's secure committee access sites as well as provide back-end support for a web-based system that allows institutions to request materials necessary for IRB approval and maintain the IRB database. The analyst must maintain the TeleForms data-entry system for hard copy data entry and aid in the planning of the design of the Oracle backend database, implement the common framework used throughout the project. The statistical programmer has the responsibility for developing study management reports dealing with accrual, enrollment, and data quality which is an extensive undertaking. The statistical programmer must develop reports for each TEDDY committee and for the External Advisory Committee and at the same time work on SAS tools to make the data more accessible to TEDDY investigators. The programmer has to deal with quality assurance and data completeness so that the study can monitor whether there is adequate follow-up, shipping is occurring in a timely fashion and whether the reference laboratories are performing as contracted. The database engineer is responsible for implementing the protocol. The engineer must design data systems including data collection systems, databases, reports, maintenance systems, and access interfaces for users such as biostatisticians, investigators, and data managers. The engineer must implement the database management systems, including Visual Basic, Oracle, automated forms technologies (Teleforms), data collection (entry), storage, reporting, and backup systems, user interfaces and access methods. The database programmer must focus on the tabulation of data and the provision of online tools as well as develop and implement online data tools to assist investigators in access to the data and the formulation of data queries that can lead to insights into the developing data sets. The database programmer must produce standard reports on protocol accrual, compliance and outcomes as well as facilitate the implementation of protocol data quality monitoring systems. The research associates are responsible for providing shipping supplies to all the clinical centers for items shipped to the Autoantibody Reference Labs, the HLA Reference Lab, and for all stool sample shipping.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for 12 months Maintenance and Support for the period of August 1, 2007 to July 31, 2008 for the following: Item 1 - STR4760 GPS Simulator System S/N 2091 and 2092 Item 2 - STR4760 GPS Simulator System S/N 2141 and 2142 Item 3 - STR4760 GPS Simulator System at NASA Wallops Island Flight Facility S/N 2043 and 2158 Item 4 - GSS7750 L5 Simulator System S/N 2273 Item 5 - STR4500 GPS Simulator System, return to base repair contract S/N 1330 Item 6 - STR4500 GPS Simulator System, return to base repair contract S/N 1095 Specs for above items are as follows: 1.  Maintenance and technical support of the NASA/Goddard Global Position System (GPS) Test Facility Simulators for a period that begins on August 1, 2007 and ends twelve months thereafter.  This contract will cover two STR4760 simulators and the GSS7750-L5, located at GSFC, the STR4760 Simulator system located at Wallops Flight Facility, and the STR4500 portable simulators at GSFC and WFF, whose maintenance agreements are due to expire on July 31, 2007.      2.   Provide intelligent technical support services to the GPS Simulator operations and insure minimum down time in 2007/2008 of these valuable Goddard resources.  This maintenance contract will also cover the upgrade of one of the simulator systems to enable GSFC engineers to perform GPS testing with the latest frequencies used by the GPS constellation of satellites. 3.  The GPS Navigation and Attitude Simulators are an integral component for the ongoing Formation Flying Test Bed (FFTB) and the Distributed Simulation Environment (DSE) activities here at GSFC.   The simulators have been, and continue to be utilized to support numerous space-flight and terrestrial projects with minimal down time due to maintenance issues.  The STR4500 system is being used for GPS software development in GSFC’s in-house receiver development activities.  The STR4760 and the STR 4500 systems at Wallops enables WFF engineers to perform GPS tests on-site for Sounding Rocket flights prior to integration and launch. 4  The GPS Simulators’ maintenance contract is an annually renewable contract, under which Spirent Federal supplies any necessary proprietary software upgrades for the operation of the systems.  Spirent Federal also maintains a technical help hotline which GSFC engineers regularly avail themselves of, and if necessary, Spirent Federal either supplies replacement parts and/or performs actual hardware maintenance on the systems either at GSFC or at their home site. 5.  The Goddard GPS Simulators, STR4760, for navigation and attitude,  7750-L5 and STR4500 for remote site testing, were manufactured by Spirent Federal Systems, specifically to satisfy Goddard requirements, and are dedicated systems that provide Goddard with capabilities unique to the spacecraft design industry.  Spirent Federal holds patents and copyrights on their hardware and source code.  These are proprietary, and not available to NASA.  Spirent Federal Systems is thus the only qualified source to currently provide technical maintenance for the Goddard 64-channel on-orbit position, attitude and time GPS Simulator STR4760 as well as the STR4500 transportable GPS simulator. 6.  NASA, in general, sponsors programs to give widest possible competitive access to industry.  However, due the statutory authority found in 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), Only Responsible Source, Spirent Federal Systems is the only possible option for the performance of maintenance contracts for these simulator systems. This procurement will be processed using the procedure in FAR Part 13 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and the Procedures set forth in FAR Sub Part 13.5 "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items". The NAICS Code and the business size standard for this procurement are 334511 and 750 employees respectively. The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or FAX) to Nadja Hardy no later than 4:30 PM on 04/06/2007.  Telephone questions will not be accepted. NASA/GSFC intends to procure the services from Spirent Federal Systems, Yorba Linda, CA.  Spirent Federal Systems is the only vendor that can provide maintenance and support for the above described GPS Simulator Systems. The authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), only one Responsible Source. DO Ratings is DO-C9.

Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. For more information on this AF Cryptographic-Modernization Industry Conference - see http://www.baskow.com/client/crypto2007/ 2.  CPSG is seeking contractor support to aid in the development of products for the "last mile" delivery of electronic keys from the DOD KMI endpoint to the end cryptographic unit (ECU).  This program is now formally known as the "Mobile Client".  Response to this RFI is requested in writing to the Contracting officer in paragraph 4.  However, contractors actively involved in developing products that could potentially fulfill the government requirement may give a 30 minute oral presentation to the Air Force in the afternoon of 11 Apr 07 - by contacting Angela Nadem-Mollaei (angela.nadem-mollaei@lackland.af.mil or (210) 977-3738).  NO DISCUSSIONS WILL BE HELD. Contractors are requested to respond to this RFI even if they have responded previously to ensure they receive all future "Mobile Client" documentation. 3.  Composed of three (3) major components, the "Mobile Client" program must develop and field:  a.  A new cryptographic engine Type 1 certifiable by the National Security Agency (NSA) which supports the loading of electronic key, application, and algorithms into various cryptographic devices.  When embedded in a host unit, it shall be capable of loading electronic key and data with many different characteristics including, but not limited to, the following: 1) encrypted applications and algorithms along with mission data; 2) traditional key, application, and algorithms in electronic form; 3) asymmetric key (current and future); 4) FIREFLY Key, application, and algorithms in any form; and 5) any future key, application, and algorithms.  The device shall load a single segment of key, application, and algorithms; a complete edition of key, application, and algorithms; or multiple editions of key, application, and algorithms to a single device or a host of devices when properly interfaced.  The cryptographic engine shall support autonomous FIREFLY Key loading (i.e. AKDELIV generation), Generic Fill Format (Black key) generation and Benign Fill Message Exchanges.  Envisioned usages include insertion into computers, mission support systems, and hand-held devices used for communications security and information assurance.    b.  A host unit will contain the developed "cryptographic engine" that is ruggedized for field use with essential interfaces (such as USB and a wireless capability) which supports Transmitting and Receiving Key, Application & Algorithm Loading, and End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) interrogation.  This host device, with its contained "cryptographic engine" and interfaces (both machine and personnel), must function as a KMI mobile client node through a wireless interface to a local KMI client node and/or to the DOD KMI primary services node (PRSN) via a wireless network and the Internet.   c.  An interface adapter set that allows the "Mobile Client" to fill both legacy ECUs (with traditional key material) and next-generation crypto devices.  The adapter set shall have multiple configurations, be ruggedized and capable of loading multi-families of Cryptographic equipment on an entire platform with a single load port or single pieces of Cryptographic equipment.  The device shall load a single segment of key or complete editions of key.  The "Adapter" shall convert wireless and wireline protocols to/from Legacy protocols (DS-101/102).  The Adapter shall be compatible with a Secure Data Transfer Device 2000 System (SDS) or Simple Key Loader (SKL).  It is envisioned the "Adapter Set" could be ordered in multiple configurations consisting of adapters for specific equipment sets located at designated locations.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Chairman, Ministry Procurement Committee, Ministry of Petroleum & Petroleum Resources Development, 80 Sir Ernest De Silva Mawatha, Colombo 7, Sri Lanka, Fax : 94 11 2564362, Tel : 94 11 2564355, Email : ndesilva@rogers.com.  Oil and Gas Regulatory Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for a grant to Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Finance and Planning, on behalf of the Ministry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development, to assist with the development of oil and gas regulations and to establish the organizational structure of the regulatory authority.

Sri Lanka presently has no oil or gas production of its own and relies entirely on imports, which are currently running around 80,000 barrels per day.  Early attempts, largely unsuccessful, to explore for Sri Lankan oil deposits focused on the northwestern coastal strip and the adjoining shallow-water off-shore area of the Cauvery Basin.  A second, more promising sedimentary basin, the deep-water Mannar Basin, located to the south of the Cauvery Basin, has seen no serious exploratory efforts.

This Technical Assistance would assist in the development of a set of comprehensive regulations, beyond those mandated in the 2003 Petroleum Resources Act, which will be needed to properly monitor and oversee petroleum operations.  Once exploration gets under way, and even more so after the discovery and placement on production of commercial reserves, a myriad of regulatory details need to be addressed.  These include permitting and bonding requirements; appraisal, development and production plans; health and safety issues during drilling and production; conservation of resources, such as flaring; environmental issues like oil spills and others; records collection and reporting procedures; supervision over completions, maintenance and abandonments of oil and gas wells; and other matters.

In brief, Sri Lanka needs to transition from its current consumer-driven oil and gas sector regulatory structure to a production-oriented regulatory structure, based on its plans to open up promising offshore oil and gas blocks to exploration and development.  

The Terms of Reference for this Technical Assistance would include the following:

Task 1:  Project Preparation and Review
	Task 2:  Environmental Analysis
	Task 3:  Developmental Impact Analysis
	Task 4:  Development of Oil and Gas Regulations
Task 5:  Establishment of Organizational Structure of Regulatory Agency 
	Task 6:  Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $ 474,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 LOCAL TIME, on May 15, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with The Advertising Council Inc. (The Ad Council), on a sole sources basis, under the authority of the Office on Women’s Health (OWH) to plan and implement a national lupus awareness campaign.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements.  The anticipated contract period will be for one base year with two, one year option periods.  

OWH requires the services of a contractor to provide support for the production, development and promotion of a nationwide public service campaign addressing lupus awareness.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a national lupus marketing campaign to increase the awareness of lupus symptoms and health effects and provide information to individuals who may be at risk for lupus to help them decide whether they should seek professional medical evaluation.  Moreover, the contractor will design and carryout a series of evaluation activities to capture the results of the campaign.  The campaign is encouraged by Congress and will generate long overdue public attention for lupus and raise recognition of the disease as a significant national public health problem that disproportionately affects young women of color.

The Ad Council is uniquely positioned, through its partnerships, non-profit status, and standing as a nationally respected organization to garner widespread support from media experts for this campaign.  The Ad Council has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to produce substantial results for expansive awareness campaigns.  These characteristics allow The Ad Council to leverage a limited Government investment to perform the requirement over a longer period of time with increased output.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirement as articulated above.  Any interested source, in order to meet OWH requirements will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement (1) strong past experience with nationwide health advertising campaigns and (2) the ability to marshal and leverage volunteer talent from the advertising and communications industries, the facilities of the media, and the resources of the business and non-profit communities to plan and implement a nationwide lupus awareness campaign.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted by 2 p.m. Eastern Time on May 14, 2007 to the point of contact listed in this announcement.  See note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Firm Fixed Price Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0026 with McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, P.O. Box 516, St. Louis, MO 63166-0516 for LITENING AT Pod Integration Kits.  The USMC has a need for interim capability for Forward Looking Infra Red (FLIR), Electro Optical (EO), Laser Target Designator, and Laser Spot Tracker (LST) for the F/A-18A+ / F/A-18C reserve aircraft.  This procurement shall allow this capability to be placed on the aforementioned aircraft.  It shall include approximately 6 integration kits with options for increased quantities.  The proposed solution is to integrate the AN/AAQ-28 (v)(8) LITENING AT Targeting Pod (Pod) on the F/A-18A+ and / or F/A-18C aircraft.  The Pods are already in use by the USMC AV-8B aircraft, 25 F/A-18D aircraft, and 14 F/A-18A+ aircraft.  A rapid integration of the Pods with the Reserves’ F/A-18A+ and / or F/A-18C will provide the USMC Reserves with a limited Air to Ground (A/G) laser targeting capability.  The pods and integration kits will be functionally checked with the F/A-18A+ and / or F/A-18C weapons systems to provide this interim capability while minimizing required hardware and software changes to the Pods and F/A-18A+ and / or F/A-18C aircraft.

This effort encompasses both the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Recurring activities required by the contractor to build, install and integrate the Pod kits on F/A-18A+ and / or F/A-18C aircraft.  This action shall include, but is not limited to, the following activities: NRE required for integration of the Pods on centerline stations with the F/A-18A+ / F/A-18C aircraft and functional check with the F/A-18 Systems Configuration Set (SCS) 19C.  Functionality of the Pods for this effort is limited to A/G, EO and IR Targeting; A/G Laser Designation, Ranging, and Marketing; and LST targeting in support of Forward Air Controller/Airborne (FAC/A) missions and Laser Guided Weapon deliver.  As the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the F/A-18 aircraft, only MDC has the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data required to successfully complete these tasks without causing unacceptable delays in meeting the fleet's operational requirements and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  Additionally, only MDC has the F/A-18 peculiar engineering data and expertise, facilities, and test equipment to provide the Government's minimum needs in a timely manner.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  NAVAIR Synopsis #: 20181-07.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Omicron Nanotechnology, USA, of Eden Prairie, Minnesota for the acquisition of an ultrahigh-vacuum, cryogenic surface science system for the development and testing of instrumentation for low-temperature atomic break-junction experiments, as part of the Intrinsic Force Standards Competence effort to be used by the Manufacturing Metrology Division at NIST.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the system to meet requirements for, 1) Low temperature scanning probe microscope hardware that will enable NIST to achieve atomic resolution on both conductive and insulating surfaces without an exchange of probe tips, 2) Sample preparation and analysis chambers integrated with the scanning probe microscope with appropriate sample transfer and load lock capabilities that will allow NIST to create and verify samples that are contamination free, 3) Technology based on quartz tuning fork sensors that enable the simultaneous measurement of force gradients and tunneling currents using a single sensing device.  This is required based on NISTs need to enable the imaging of an atomic junction immediately after rupture, data that is crucial to NIST efforts to model and understand the physics of atom with atom force interactions, and 4) the Omicron system with a tuning fork sensor is the only device available at this time that is capable of such combined measurements.  As a result, Omicron is uniquely qualified to provide the required ultrahigh-vacuum, cryogenic surface science system.  Omicron is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required system.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423490, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by April 10, 2007 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SUBJECT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION DESC: It is the Government's intent to award a modification to Capitol IT Solutions, 13907 Carlson Farm Drive, Germantown, MD 20874, as small business, for the purchase of services, support, onsite/local he lp desk and technical support, network operations and other infrastructure services, maintenance, and support to the TATRC field office located in Fort Detrick, MD. This is a modification that will require from the outset, and at all times during the perfo rmance term, 2 System Engineers that are fully qualified personnel with experience to provide the full range of help desk network operations and other (technical research, development, testing and evaluation, as directed). This also included leasing of a s erver and support. The current TATRC staff member would not be able to perform thier assigned tasks without the services and support this contract offers. In addition, the delay to get a new contractor on board and equipment leaded will have an adverse imp act on operations at TATRC East Coast office. In essence, TATRC staff members will have to stop work until new servers could be ordered. Also, trying to get a new contractor to provide another set of leased equipment to take the place of the current equipm ent would be more expensive then awarding this contract to Capitol IT Solutions. Within the next couple of months, a new requirement will be coming out for competition to cover these services. This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Prop osal. No solicitation document is available and telephone request will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on basis of offeres received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition  would be advatageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the service will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification based on this notice is soley within th e discretion of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 6 April 2007. EMAIL: michelle.maldonado@det.amedd.army.mil.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO is renewing their support contract for the Remedy Help Desk Application Software as well as the licenses that they currently have from a previous procurement of Remedy.  They will be utilizing this support during ad after the DO/PPT Help Desk integration; it is imperative that this product support be renewed.  The following is a description of the services required which will be renewed with the award of this requisition: CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. This requisition is to renew the existing support contract and licenses which is justified by the following qualifications, unique to this requirement:   The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005.  Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution.  Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications.  Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an “out-of-the-box” solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices.  It has been recommended, based on a cost-benefit analysis, to configure a development environment for: ·	Conducting development efforts ·	Testing developed products ·	Compatibility testing ·	Use case scenario testing ·	Infrastructure change testing and evaluation ·	Training ·	Demonstrations The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the system’s current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ·	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ·	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DO’s Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.<BR><BR>support contract # 32102.<BR><BR>CHANGED LINE ITEM 004<BR><BR>CHANGED LINE ITEM 001<BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Peru intends to seek proposals from qualified U.S. organizations interested in providing services to promote sustainable licit development in the communities and regions affected by illicit coca cultivation in Peru.  The Promoting Integrated Development activity will be the principal mechanism in the USAID/Peru Alternative Development Program (ADP) over the 2008-2012 period.  The goals are to:  1)  assist significant numbers of new communities and families to transition to a licit lifestyle after programmed eradication; 2) ensure the sustainability of the licit development gains that have been made to date and commitment to licit lifestyles in the 800 communities of the 2002-2006 voluntary eradication program by consolidating those gains; and, if circumstances necessitate, 3) enroll a limited number of new communities and families into the ongoing program after voluntary eradication of their coca.  The primary focus of the activity will be post-programmed eradication alternative development, with a somewhat lower level of investment of resources on consolidating the gains of the current program.

USAID plans to award a cost reimbursement completion-type contract with a total estimated cost estimated of $75 to $80 million covering a total estimated period of five years:  a three (3) years base period and two (2) one-year option periods.   Revealing the estimated range for the contract does not mean that Offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amount estimated.  Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of a best value determination for contract award, including cost effective approaches to achieving the results.

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of U.S. organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  It should be understood that this is a follow-on activity to the Participatory Alternative Development activity that is currently being implemented by Chemonics International under a cost-reimbursement award-fee type contract that expires on March 31, 2008.  The incumbent is not eliminated from this competition.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the closing date of this announement from  23 April 2007 to 25 April 2007.  No additional modifications have been made.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The objective of the PhASER program is to develop a fundamental photonic integrated circuit (PIC), termed “Unit Cell”, which can act as a reconfigurable building block in the formation of a high-throughput, low-power, analog signal processor.  The intent of this program is to enable scalable PIC-based analog signal processors that overcome the limits of conventional Silicon-based digital signal processing technology.  Specific program goals include:

•	Definition of a photonic analog signal-processing engine “Unit Cell” which is comprised of waveguide-connected, programmable, active photonic elements. These unit cells should enable basic filtering operations on their own or arbitrarily complex filter operations when connected within a large array of Unit Cells;
•	Development of a program plan that will permit the fabrication, testing, and evaluation of the Unit Cell;
•	Description of how the Unit Cell, when arrayed within a high-density PIC, will scale and meet the PhASER filter challenge problem, as well as how the Unit Cells will be programmed and tested at the chip-level to ensure high yield;  
•	Development of a filter synthesis tool to demonstrate how Unit Cells will perform in the context of generalized high-order filters.
•	Implementation of a technical approach to experimentally demonstrate the Unit Cell performance milestones; 

DARPA may consider compelling proposals with highly innovative technical approaches that fall short of the above program goals. Those offering such proposals should provide unambiguous physical arguments, based on data, simulations, and calculations, leading to estimates of practical and fundamental performance limits in operational parameters of the envisioned PhASER.

The PhASER program will consist of a single phase whose focus is on the development and demonstration of the PhASER Unit Cell.  Proposers must define a realistic schedule and budget to meet the milestone and deliverable schedule.  It is recommended that the proposed program plan include interim milestones at approximately the halfway point of the program.  Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:

I. Demonstration of photonic filtering technology; 
II. Filter Algorithms; 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 07-17 Proposer Information Pamphlet referred below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Photonic Analog Signal-Processing Engines with Reconfigurability (PhASER) program will consist of a single phase whose focus is on the development and demonstration of the PhASER Unit Cell.  Supporting tasks will include the development and demonstration of a filter synthesis software tool, and a related transition plan.  Proposers must define a realistic schedule and budget to meet the milestone and deliverable schedule.  It is recommended that the proposed program plan include interim milestones at approximately the halfway point of the program. Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming including different expertise such as, but not limited to: photonic and electronic device design, fabrication, and packaging; filter design and integration; and military sensor processing system analysis are strongly encouraged.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Michael Haney, phone: (571) 218-4813, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: Mike.Haney@darpa.mil. 

PROPOSER’S QUESTIONS

A “Proposer’s Questions,” website will be posted for BAA 07-17 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto).  If you would like to have a question answered and posted on this site, please send your question to the following address: BAA07-17@darpa.mil.
  
GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 07-17, Photonic Analog Signal-Processing Engines with Reconfigurability (PhASER), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/,World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. 

 In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  The proposal abstract must be submitted to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa on 27 February 2007.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposal abstracts should not be submitted via www.grants.gov.  

Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit a full proposal to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa, or via www.grants.gov for Universities wishing to use the "Apply" function, on or before 25 April 2007 in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.gov.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 07-17, Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in integrated photonics. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 07-17.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.


EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:
(l) Overall scientific and technical merit; (2) Potential contribution and relevance to the goals of the BAA; (3) Relevance of milestones; (4) Realism of the proposed schedule; (5) Offeror’s capabilities and related experience; and (6) Cost reasonableness and realism.  Cost/Price reasonableness will be made prior to award.

<DESC>This announcement is a followup to the Sources Sought announcement published January 25, 2007.  The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to solicit proposals on a 100% small business set-aside basis as a follow-on to contract  N01-ES-15478 awarded to the University of Washington.  

Contract objectives include  1)  establish a catalog of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in prioritized environmental response genes (ERGs) based on direct re-sequencing of selected genes; 2)  use high-throughput sequencing technologies for rapid sequencing analysis utilizing a national sample repository for analysis of sequence variation in the U.S. population and make this data available to the scientific community via centralized public databases; 3)  develop web-based tools to display estimated haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium patterns in human populations using the EGP data sets; 4)  evaluate the population distributions of estimated haplotypes and identify evolutionary patterns among the human populations represented in the polymorphism discovery resource samples; and 5)  mine the sequence variation in EGP genes to highlight potential functional coding or non-coding variants for further biological testing. 

Specific performance will involve re-sequencing up to a total of seventy-five (75) gene equivalents (GE) over a four (4) year period from genomic DNA obtained from a sample of ninety-five (95) ethnically defined individuals, data entry and validation.  

The estimated release date for the solicitation is mid April. The estimated receipt date for proposals is late May.  Electronic versions of the RFP will be available at http://www.niehs.nih.gov/oamb/rcb/rfp.htm.    All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.  See notes No. 1. and 26.

The Contracting Officer has decided to conduct a competitive procurement for this requirement. RFQ-OH-07-00086, for the Sample Analysis of Aquatic Flora and Fauna Identification and Measurement for the Shepherd Creek Best Management Practice (BMP) Project will be issued on Tuesday, April 3, 2007.  If a contractor is interested in receiving the RFQ for this EPA requirement they must submit  a request via email for RFQ-OH-07-00086 to Scott Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541710, size standard $6.5 million.  The background behind this EPA requirement is as follows: The EPA's National Risk Management Research  Laboratory (NRMRL), has formed a multidisciplinary Sustainable Environments Branch (SEB) within the Sustainable Technology Division (STD), with the charge of constructing a Sustainable Environments System Strategy that includes the development of environmental risk management methods. The EPA has  been testing the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) on private parcels to mitigate the effects of excess stormwater runoff from developed areas on the hydrologic and ecological integrity of the watershed.  However, the degree to which BMPs that are chosen using economic efficiency standards to  improve environmental conditions of the watershed have not been assessed. Several ecological indicators, including the species diversity and composition of benthic macroinvertebrates and algae, will be used to measure the ecological effectiveness of BMPs. The contractor shall use the latest field  identification references and technology, identify the aquatic flora and fauna in freshwater stream samples, and provide this information to the EPA, following Agency sorting and processing protocol.  Quotations are due by April 16, 2007 at 4:00 PM (EST) to Scott A. Fogle, at fogle.scott@epa.gov  or via fax at 513 487-2107.  Technical Questions or comments may also be directed to Scott A.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, Portland, Oregon (COE) is conducting a market survey on the availability of potential contractors to provide acoustic micro-transmitters intended for implantation into yearling and sub-yearling Chi nook salmon.  The COE has developed and demonstrated a juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous and networked acoustic receivers (nodes) that meet its needs for evaluating the surviva l of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Hydropower System.  The COE intends to award multiple firm-fixed price supply contracts in 2007 for the production of JSATS micro-transmitters for 2008 fisheries research projects. Prior to issuing a solicitation the COE will conduct a workshop for interested parties to preview the current and future uses of this tool and to preview the specifications of the JSATS micro-acoustic transmitter.  The workshop will be conducted on Wednesd ay, 04 April, 2007, at 10:00, on the 6th floor of the Robert Duncan Plaza, 333SW, 1st Ave, Portland, Oregon.  The solicitation will be available on or about 13 April, 2007 with proposals due on or about 29 June, 2007. This procurement action will be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase. In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria of the solicitation, the Contractor must demonstrate that the acoustic tags meet functional and design specifications for size, shape, performance, quality assurance and bio-compatibility.  Included in the evaluation of firms will be their history for on-schedule delivery of large quantities of high quality telemetry devices. Evaluatio n criteria and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when issued.   If an offerors Technical proposal meets the criteria as established in the Evaluation factors, and the offerors price is determined fair & reasonable, the offer will culm inate in an award, for the evaluation phase.  It is the Governments intent to award several contracts to qualified firms.  The evaluation phase will consist of the preparation of fully functional tag prototypes which will be evaluated for size and perform ance by a COE contractor.  Following acceptance testing of prototypes and for firms that meet or exceed predetermined transmitter specifications the COE will use Tradeoff/Best Value protocols to select up to 2 companies to enter into the production phase o f the contract.   Selection of these firms will be based first on transmitter size and second on the per unit cost. Evaluation and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when issued.   Companies selected to produce prototype JSATS transmitters will be notified on or around 13 July, 2007 with prototypes being due for testing no later than 31 August, 2007.  Selection of a final contractor or contractors for the production phase of this con tract shall be made in October, 2007.   The contract period will be for 24 months.

<SOLNBR>DADA09-07-T9006
<RESPDATE>043007
<ARCHDATE>06292007
<CONTACT>kevin.w.hill1, 210-292-3270
<DESC>A.	General Information The Central TRBO Region, a military integrated delivery network comprised of 44 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation for the standardization of Disposable Endo-Mechanical Products.   The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for Disposable Endo-Mechanical products that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that stand ardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX., Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK., William Beaumont Army Me dical Center Fort Bliss, TX., 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO., Evans ACH Fort Carson CO., Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO., Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV., and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA. This initiative is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) AN D a separate commercial agreement with the DoD Prime Vendor(s) for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to t he Prime Vendor program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil . The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month o ption periods.  The anticipated award date is July 2007.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value/trade-off criteria. B.	Products and Performance Required The Central Region is seeking a vendor that can supply a full line of Disposable Endo-Mechanical Products. The estimated total volume for this region in this product line is $2,249,082.00 based on historical sales for a 12-month period. At the request of the Central Regions MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, education resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of brands, ty pes and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to All Offerors If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your response to Mr. James Quinn at jim.quinn.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil and include the following information: Company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, solicitation number, DAPA number and complete answers to technical criteria.  This process will include vendor requirements for electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic bes t price offers.  Contact Mr. Jim Quinn at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this solicitation with any further questions.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. Respondents must provide detailed information on Disposable Endo-Mechanical products which clearly outlines the requirements stated within this notice along with an electronic copy of your literature to support all responses by close of business on 30 Apri l 2007.  Those companies that do not respond by this date will be eliminated from consideration.   If your company is not a current DAPA holder for this product line, you may still be eligible to participate in this standardization effort for this region by contacting DSCP, Ms Kim Nichols at (215) 737-7124 or email Kim.nichols@dla.mil to apply for a DAP A.  Your company will be considered once DAPA paperwork is pending at DSCP and you provide your DSCP log number to this TRBO by close of business on 30 April 2007. D.	Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region. They are the decision makers for this initi ative. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to particip ate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert-like one to five rating scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree  worst score) to 5 (Strongly Agree  best score).  All clinical criteria are weighted equally. Minimum clinical acceptability i s considered a total average score of 3 or above on a five scale rating. The TPRB has set a 3.0 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.0 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from furt her consideration in the standardization process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.0 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Central Region. Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 year s).  In addition to the required discounted pricing from DAPA for participating regional commands, vendors should also submit additional tier pricing in the event that they are afforded added volume from standardization commitments from other regions.  However,  alternate (tiered) pricing proposals will not be evaluated as part of the selection.  E.	Technical Criteria Evaluation The TRBO and Clinical Product Team (CPT) will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria includes responses to all questions in this  section that demonstrate: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the li ne or products and/or services offered meet the medical standar ds of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region. 1.	Does your company manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of Disposable Endo-Mechanical Products? 2.	Are your products available through the Prime Vendor, Cardinal Health? 3.	What is your DAPA number for this product line? 4.	Under what brand(s) does your company manufacture or distribute your product? 5.	Under what standards is your product manufactured? 6.

What types of educational tools or materials do you have for this product line? 10.	What kind of staff training does your company provide? 11.	Does your company provide 24/7 customer service? 12.	Is there any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line? If yes, please provide dates and duration, cause, and resolution. F.  Clinical Criteria Evaluation Following acceptability of the technical criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request samples from the product group to be evaluated at selected MTFs.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committ ed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The CPT, comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines, will evaluate Disposable Endo-Mechanical  products and recommend the preferred product bas ed upon clinical evaluation of the products.  Clinical factors will be weighted equally on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree  worst score) to 5 (Strongly Agree  best score).  Minimum clinical acceptability is considered a total average score of 3 or above. 1.	Assembly/Disassembly of parts are without difficultly 2.	Packaging is easy to open aseptically 3.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG.  The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers of self-propelled or towed Pallet Loaders as described follows:   

The U.S. Coast Guard desires to locate sources for a small, lightweight, self-propelled or towed pallet loader that is air transportable and easily maintainable.  This pallet loader must be easily transportable on the U.S. Coast Guard HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft (CN-235-300M) with minimal set-up or adjustment to fit the cargo hold, preferably transported on the loading ramp itself, so as not to interfere with the load volume of the aircraft.  The desired Pallet Loader would need to be easily adjustable for elevation to raise or lower the load and have load tie-downs and an anchor system for air transportation.  Loader would be used to transport and load and unload military pallets measuring 108” by 88” with varying weights.  On the HC-144 these pallets load lengthwise.  A roller system to assist loading and unloading of pallets might be beneficial.  Electrically powered units would need to have sealed air transportable batteries.   Information on the CN-235 is available at www.eads.net. 

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, and telephone number; point of contact (POC), and complete product details, measurements, weights, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options.  Also, please state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product.  Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the loader.  The Government believes the applicable NAICS Code is 333924 INDUSTRIAL TRUCK, TRACTOR, TRAILER, AND STACKER MACHINERY manufacturing, and 333999 ALL OTHER MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY MANUFACURING.  The size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 750 employees. Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?  (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?   (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC’s and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC’s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.  After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the CBD. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to Dorsey Johr at Bldg 19, U.S. Coast Guard, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or if e-mailed to Dorsey.H.Johr@USCG.mil and please copy to Kevin.S.Barrick@USCG.mil.  TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Responses must be received no later than 25 April, 2007 at 13:00 p.m. EST.  Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.  All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>This is a request for information/sources sought notice to assist the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST), Building and Fire Research Laboratory in completing market research for a specified  research, knowledge development, synthesis, and technology transfer procurement that is planned for fiscal year 2007.  No solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this sources sought notice.  The planned NAICS code to be used is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences.  
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) has a long history of serving the measurements and standards needs of the building and fire safety industries.  In this service, NIST BFRL performs problem-focused structural engineering research related to buildings and other structures.  Key areas of structural engineering research include risk assessment and mitigation (including performance prediction and evaluation) for earthquakes, extreme winds, fires, floods, explosions, and impacts.  The earthquake-related research is performed under the auspices of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).  This problem-focused research concentrates on efforts that support the development of national model building codes, standards, guidelines, enabling tools, and industry practices.  This research complements research implementation activities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  Some of this research links results of fundamental (“basic”) research that has been completed under National Science Foundation grants to universities with FEMA’s implementation efforts.
In 2003, the Applied Technology Council (ATC) completed a study for NIST that culminated in a report, ATC-57, The Missing Piece: Improving Seismic Design and Construction Practices.  In this report, ATC outlined a broad problem-focused research, knowledge development, synthesis, and technology transfer program for NIST to follow in fulfilling its role within NEHRP – this outline has become known as a “roadmap” for NIST earthquake hazard reduction research.  The purpose of this contract is to develop a NIST partnership with practitioners and research institutions that will be used to implement the “roadmap.”

<DESC>Request for Information for FEDLOG
 
1.0	SUBJECT/GENERAL INFORMATION

Request for Information (RFI). The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) requires development, mastering, production/distribution, and support services (training and user technical support) to augment and provide on-going production of the FED LOG CD-ROM and DVD product.  FED LOG is a logistics information software program that enables authorized users to retrieve large amounts of unique data quickly and easily.  Mastered from 62 files provided by Department of Defense other Federal sources, FED LOG provides logistics information on approximately 8 million individual items of supply.  FED LOG is available on a five CD disc set or one DVD disc and has a subscription base of approximately 30,000 per month.  
Responses are due to this RFI by 3:00 PM on April 23, 2007  

2.0	DESCRIPTION/REQIREMENTS

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

This replacement and augmentation product must support user environments ranging from 16-bit DOS based applications (for system to system interfaces and disc to system interfaces), mid-1990’s UNIX platforms, extended through 32-bit Windows environments and finally – to a modern system of operations which runs in a Web Browser, and employs a desktop runtime environment capability (principally the Java Runtime Environment or JRE).  This product will have the advantage of a relational data structure using object oriented principles, and extends the presentation of the data into the client-application space, while at the same time maintaining backward compatibility and full functionality with legacy systems.  Operation of the portable media product must conform to established DoD application and security standards and policies.  The rationale is to provide customers with a product that equals and mimics Web behavior and appearance, but operates in off-line operations and in environments where connectivity is non-existent, minimal, or compromised.   While there are known implementations of the two separated production environments, we know of no process that blends legacy and web based applications.  It is imperative that the interested vendor provides a solution or set of solutions which combine the spectrum of known customer platforms, operating systems, systems capabilities, and interfaces.  The product must be offered in both CD-ROM and DVD formats.  Other potential mobile memory devices MAY be considered, but the CD-ROM and DVD requirements must be met.  Provide a brief (not more than ten pages) White Paper  to identify and describe the availability/status/schedule of any potential solutions and identify risk areas or categories and the severity of each.   Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost.  This will enable the Government to evaluate impact on the acquisition strategy and finalize the requirement.  Specify if the vendor has the capability to provide this solution under an existing GSA Schedule or other government contract vehicle 



Conceptual technical architecture alternatives 
•	Technical feasibility alternatives assessments
•	Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives
•	Schedule estimates
•	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing FEDLOG 

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about requirements enumerated above, plus any additional data not currently considered.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 3 (New York/New Jersey) is seeking sources for the provision of a cost-per-test Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS).  This would be structured such that VISN 3 retains ownership of all data, and all data would be stored on VISN 3 premises.  However, the one-time cost per test would be inclusive of all necessary consumables (e.g. storage media) and equipment (except workstations) needed to keep the system performing to contractual specifications. The single VISN-wide proposed system must interface with all five VistA and VistA Imaging systems in VISN 3 (via HL7 and DICOM) so as to be able to receive patient and exam information, either directly or through imaging equipment as an intermediary.  The PACS shall then be capable of communicating imaging reports back to the Vista Radiology/Nuclear Medicine package, either directly or via an integrated radiology voice recognition system. The proposed system must be capable of a high degree of integration with the Powerscribe Radiology Voice Recognition System.  Software and enhancement releases must be supportive of the IHE Technical Framework and must be provided at no additional cost to VISN 3 for the duration of the contract.  Additionally, an unlimited site license for all PACS software shall be included in the cost per test.  Images from the PACS shall be viewable throughout the enterprise via a web-based viewer, and this viewer must be interfaced with Vista/CPRS, to include passing authentication, patient context, and study context from CPRS to PACS. Further, the system must have a known, working interface to VistA Web, to allow image access by other VISNs. The proposed system must be compliant with the most recent DICOM  and HL-7 conformance standards.  In order to minimize bandwidth utilization of the network and also to reduce waiting times for users, images must be capable of being viewed in lower resolution prior to the entire DICOM dataset being received at the viewing location, with additional image data transmitted as needed. Vendors should indicate their ability to provide this system by contacting Stephanie A. Morreale, Contracting Officer, stephanie.morreale@va.gov, no later than April 6, 2006. DISCLAIMER    This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>LDCM Data Access Tool General Information     Document Type: 	Special Notice     Solicitation Number: 	     Posted Date: 		     Original Response Date: 	     Current Response Date: 	     Original Archive Date: 	     Current Archive Date: 	 Contracting Office Address U S GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,  APS PO BOX 25046 MS204A  DENVER FEDERAL CENTER  DENVER CO 80225 Description This is not a notice for a solicitation. This is only a Request for Information (RFI).     The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid but merely a request for information. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) is considering issuing an RFP for the development of a Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) Data Access Tool.  The LDCM Data Access Tool would be accessed through an existing USGS web server and will provide users with the capability to search, order, or download LDCM imagery.  It is anticipated that the LDCM Data Access Tool may make use of existing interfaces to USGS imagery archives and other sub-systems services.  The current EROS services are:  Registration (user authentication); Catalog (products, pricing, and order submittal), Image (pre-view image delivery), Inventory (imagery metadata), and Parameter (user-selectable processing options).  Alternative approaches that do not utilize the EROS services are also of interest and will be strongly considered. The primary functions of the LDCM Data Access Tool are the following: 1. Provide user registration and authentication 2. Geographically search USGS inventories of remote sensing imagery, including Landsat and other imagery 3. Display sub-sampled or full resolution preview imagery and metadata 4. Support both product ordering and direct download of  imagery 5. Implement standing order requests for new data 6. Interface with existing services at EROS or alternatively provide those capabilities (registration, catalog, browse image, inventory, and parameter services) The LDCM Data Access Tool will provide these functions for LDCM data, and the USGS is interested in solutions that can be easily extended to provide these functions for all historical Landsat and other remote sensing data too. The LDCM user community has been divided into five primary groups: 1. Power Users (Scientists, Government, Academic) 2. High Volume Users  3. Casual Users (Academic K-12, Public, Policy Makers) 4. Disaster Responders 5. Internal users with unique requirements (Cal/Val, etc.) The LDCM Project has unique needs for each group of users, but the LDCM Data Access Tool will serve primarily the Power Users as described above.  Even though the Power Users are USGS's primary customer, we are also very interested in solutions that can be easily extended to serve the needs of the other user groups above as well.  As an aid in procurement planning, the USGS seeks information on architectural and implementation options that will provide the greatest potential customer satisfaction while minimizing the impacts to the existing EROS infrastructure.  The USGS seeks specific information in the following areas: 1. There are several unique factors that distinguish the LDCM Data Access Tool from existing or traditional search and order applications.  First, the Data Access Tool will serve the unique needs of the science community.  Second, the full Landsat data archive contains worldwide imagery over decadal time spans.  The USGS seeks innovative approaches to user interface design and navigation that go beyond traditional web interfaces and search techniques to provide an effective, efficient easy to learn interface for these unique needs.  Responses should identify approaches to efficiently search over the three decades of Landsat imagery (i.e. visualization of data stacks) and that assist the science user in selecting Landsat images for inclusion in multi-temporal data products.  These multi-temporal data products would assist users in performing change detection over time. 2. Specific system architecture, including high-level block diagrams/flow charts, security, and general functional descriptions.  Indicate if the system architecture is platform independent and the specific use and tailoring of COTS products.  Indicate how the architecture meets the desired goals of flexibility and expandability/scalability. 3. The LDCM Data Access Tool may be built upon legacy back-end services for billing, archive, etc.  The USGS seeks specific past experiences and lessons learned in designing and implementing similar front-end search and order tools, including discussions of the trade-offs and risks of using legacy services. 4. Rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and a high-level schedule for development, integration, testing, production release, equipment, licensing and one year of technical support and maintenance for the Data Access Tool.  The estimate should include any assumptions (e.g. deliverable documents, long-term O&M approach, hardware platforms, licensing, etc.) and should highlight major cost drivers and opportunities for cost savings. 5. The Landsat program is expected to continue for decades.  The USGS is interesting in hearing options for cost-effective long-term operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Data Access Tool, including delivery of source code and all necessary tools for internal O&M by USGS. Information responding to this request should be received within 21 calendar days from publication of this notice.   Concise responses are encouraged and appreciated; it is not necessary to respond to all parts of this RFI.  Organizations interested in providing responses or additional information in person are requested to schedule a briefing at the USGS Center for EROS in Sioux Falls, SD. Informational Documents Documents describing the LDCM system can be accessed on the LDCM websites at http://ldcm.gsfc.nasa.gov  and http://ldcm.usgs.gov.

This sole source is to modify the existing contracts by extending the period of performance by four months (June 14, 2007  through October 13, 2007) and by increasing the total contract ceiling price.  These contracts provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT).  The extension for the current contracts will prevent a lapse in service during negotitation and award of multiple contracts under RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 for Patent Legal Services currently posted on www.fbo.gov.  This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 as it is impracticable to seek competition for the four month period while completing negotiations under RFP #263-2006-P(GM)-0247.  Interruption of service would result in significant harm to the U.S. Government in the loss of intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign countries in connection with multiple patent cases.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Masterspec
<DESC>Statement of Work 
For 
GSA Version of MASTERSPEC Update
And
Related Services

1.0	BACKGROUND 
1.1	The Public Buildings Service (PBS), one of the services within the General Services Administration (GSA), provides work environments for over one million Federal employees nationwide.  Created in 1949, PBS serves as a builder, developer, lessor and manager of federally owned and leased properties providing a full range of real estate services: real estate brokerage, property management, construction and repairs, security services, property disposal and overall portfolio management. PBS services over 100 Federal agencies and Commissions and maintains a diverse portfolio of over 8,000 buildings containing about 300 million gross square feet, including border stations, computer centers, courthouses, laboratories, office, parking, storage, and warehouse space.  

1.2	PBS regional Property Development Offices plan, procure and manage design and construction delivery services for prospectus projects using a variety of contract delivery methods across a variety of applicable federal regulations, building types, client agency needs and local conditions. As part of its project delivery support resources to contracted A-E’s, PBS maintains a GSA Version of MASTERSPEC, modified to address construction contract requirements that are unique to facilities GSA constructs and manages. The GSA Version of MASTERSPEC was last updated in 1998. An update to the GSA Version of MASTERSPEC is required to maintain up-to-date GSA project delivery resources for use by PBS regional offices and their contracted A-E’s. 
2.0	SCOPE
The scope of services under this requirement include providing professional services necessary to assist GSA staff in updating Division 1 documents and to convert GSA fire/life safety and mechanical sections to the 2004 edition of CSI/CSC’s MasterFormat. Distribute the updated GSA Version of MASTERSPEC to the Licensed Users of MASTERSPEC on the MASTERSPEC CD-ROM system and ARCOM website.
3.0	REQUIREMENTS
3.1	Provide professional services as necessary to update the GSA Version of MASTERSPEC and to convert these sections to MasterFormat 2004 section numbers and titles. The update will include the existing GSA sections (based on older versions of MASTERSPEC and sections unique to GSA), and additional sections that have been added to MASTERSPEC, with emphasis areas noted, per the Attached TOC. Specific tasks to accomplish the work include.
3.1.1	Collect proposed language and revisions to existing GSA language.
3.1.2	Review proposed language for good specifications practices.
3.1.3	Review proposed language for conflicts and coordination with other GSA Division 1 sections.
3.1.4	Review proposed language for conflicts and coordination with MASTERSPEC technical sections.
3.1.5	Suggest improvements to proposed specification language.
3.1.6	Convene meetings and facilitate consensus among involved GSA subject matter experts.
3.1.7	Assist in coordinating federal acquisition clauses with the GSA Version of MASTERSPEC.
3.1.8	Where GSA contract requirements are not addressed by Division 1 or FAR clauses, assist in compiling a list of topics/issues for inclusion in a separate update of GSA supplemental clauses and Division 0 language.
3.1.9	Reconcile suggestions and revisions with a GSA specifications working group.
3.2	Provide professional services as necessary to convert one (1) GSA fire/life safety specification (section 01596) to MasterFormat 2004 section number and title. This section was created by GSA. Standardize the section for styles and headers/footers to be consistent with MASTERSPEC and to work with ARCOM’s MASTERWORKS software. Additionally, work with GSA to update and incorporate the 13 National Capital Region specification sections into the GSA Version of MASTERSPEC. 
3.3	Provide professional services as necessary to convert the GSA mechanical specifications to MasterFormat 2004 section numbers and titles (71 sections in Division 15). Standardize the section for styles and headers/footers to be consistent with MASTERSPEC and to work with ARCOM’s MASTERWORKS software.
3.4	Create a conversion matrix from MasterFormat 1995 to MasterFormat 2004 for the mechanical sections. Once GSA reviews and approves the matrix, use it to automate the conversion of these sections. Should the matrix indicate that sections need to be split into multiple sections, or that sections need to be combined into one section, provide services as necessary to accomplish the conversion.
3.5	Provide logistical support and coordination to convene and facilitate groups of GSA subject matter experts to accomplish the systematic review, drafting or revision and final editing of the GSA Version of MASTERSPEC. Specific tasks to accomplish the work include.
3.5.1	Planning, coordinating schedules with meeting participants, and conducting teleconferences/web conferences and meetings with GSA.
3.5.2	Conduct up to forty (40), 4-hour meetings with GSA specification subject matter experts to review and update the GSA Version of MASTERSPEC sections. Either on-site or web-based meetings venues will be acceptable, subject to approval by the COTR.
3.5.3	Plan and convene a separate one day, 8-hour meeting of OCA and GSA regional stakeholders to develop a policy for electronic and BIM deliverables among the A-E-C delivery team, and to develop related construction contract requirements to incorporate in Division 1.

Provide a price for each performance period (base and all options) for a location.  If your company charges an environmental fee, enter the weekly fee in row 24.  If your company charges an energy surcharge during periods of high energy costs, enter the applicable percentage rate in row 27.  The percentage rate will be applicable to the rental total for the week.  In row 28, enter the percentage rate for the weekly lost/damage fee.  The lost/damaged replacement fee will fund the replacement costs for items lost or damaged by commissary personnel.  The rate will be applied to the total rental fee, excluding environmental fee and energy surcharge, if applicable.  The fee will eliminate the need for billing for individual items and for reconciliation of lost/damaged items at the end of the contract.  In row 30, enter the cost to attach one organization patch (provided by the Government) to one garment in the “Miscellaneous Garment Preparation and Repair”.  If the offeror does not charge for garment preparation, enter ‘0’.  The cost to attach one organization patch to one garment will be multiplied by the total number of upper body garments required for that location.  If a price is not entered for lines 1-30 described above, it will be assumed the item or service will be provided without charge for that item.  The resulting total dollar amount for each CLIN on the Linen Listing must be entered into the corresponding CLIN.  The associated CLIN Number can be found at the top of the Linen Listing.  EXTENSIONS IN PRICING WILL BE CORRECTED.  ITEM UNIT COST LISTED IN THE LINEN LISTING WILL PREVAIL.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Statement of Work

A. Background Information: The National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexes more than 600,000 articles annually from more than 5,000 journals for MEDLINE, NLM’s premier bibliographic database that contains over 15 million citations to journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine.  MEDLINE is the major component of PubMed, NLM’s free online bibliographic information and retrieval service (available at pubmed.gov).   Subject indexing for MEDLINE consists of application of appropriate subject headings from NLM’s controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).  Indexing policies are specified in the NLM Indexing Manual, technical memoranda, and other indexing aids. Nearly 200 individuals, including NLM staff, contractors, and staff at cooperating national and international centers participate in indexing for MEDLINE/PubMed.  Although there is a high degree of quality assurance review and computerized checking and validation built into the MEDLINE indexing production stream, it is inevitable because of the large volume of work that a few indexing errors may appear in completed MEDLINE citations.  The purpose of this project is to formulate strategies to search MEDLINE to detect potential indexing errors, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction. 

B. Purpose and Objective:   To acquire services to formulate strategies to search PubMed to detect potential indexing errors in MEDLINE citations, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction.

C. Contractor Requirements: Using advanced PubMed search capabilities, the Contractor will formulate PubMed search strategies to identify those citations that are likely to include an indexing error (usually an inappropriate MeSH heading or a missing MeSH heading). For a very simple example, a search would be developed to retrieve citations with the text word “mouse” or “mice” in the citation title or abstract, but without the MeSH heading MICE.  The Contractor will print out the results of each PubMed search performed, and hand mark the printout to indicate which MeSH term(s) should be added or deleted.  Actual maintenance of MEDLINE citations will be performed by NLM.  The Contractor will also store each PubMed search strategy to be rerun at approximately one-month intervals to detect errors in newly-added citations. There are currently about 40 existing stored searches to detect indexing errors, and the Contractor will run those at approximately one-month intervals, but it is anticipated that additional searches will be needed in the future. The Contractor will submit the marked printouts to NLM not later than the first week of each month.   If the Contractor works at a site outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the marked printouts will be sent to NLM via FedEx.   The Contractor will also submit monthly reports indicating how many searches were performed and how many corrections were marked on citation printouts; such monthly reports should be submitted to NLM within the first week of each month.

D. Government Responsibilities: NLM will provide the overall guidance and approval of submitted work. NLM will communicate to the Contractor the specific “topic” for which a new, additional search strategy is needed to detect indexing errors (the contractor will not on their own identify new “topics” for which new search strategies might be needed).  If the Contractor works outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the NLM will provide Contractor with FedEx airbills for shipment of marked search results.

<DESC>841st TTB Building 3310
LAN / Telephone Infrastructure Renovation
Scope of Work

The LAN / Telephone infrastructure in Building 3310 has reached the end of its life cycle and is in need of renovation.  The existing plant is problematic and in places ad-hoc in order to support expansion since the plant was originally installed.

In order to utilize the full high speed capability of existing and future electronic equipment and alleviate problematic telephone issues the existing CAT 5 LAN cabling and CAT 3 phone cabling should be removed and replaced with CAT 6 cabling and terminated on CAT 6 hardware for LAN and appropriate Telco hardware for digital phone service.  

Known Tasks:
1.	Existing Infrastructure removal.
A.	The existing CAT 5 infrastructure is to be removed from the building including:
a.	All CAT 5 LAN cabling in the ceiling and throughout the building.

a.	The removal of all existing phone cabling in the ceiling and throughout the building.
b.	The removal of all instances of wall or surface mount telephone outlets throughout the building.

2.	Cable Tray installation.
A.	Installation of cable tray to support new CAT 6 LAN and digital phone cabling is to be installed by the contractor.  The tray should extend from the existing communications closet and routed throughout the building.
a.	It will be the responsibility of the contractor to determine the best installation routing to access the power poles associated with the modular furniture and routing to the drops that are to be installed “down the wall”.
b.	It will be the responsibility of the contractor to determine appropriate size and quantity of tray to support the distribution of LAN / Phone drops described later in this document.

3.	CAT 6 Cabling (Modular Furniture)
A.	CAT 6 cabling will be routed from the communications closet through the installed tray system to power pole locations throughout the building common area.
a.	The cabling is to be routed down the provided power poles and distributed through the furniture to furniture mounted pre-loaded 4 port CAT 6 faceplates and terminated. 
b.	There will be a total of 22 four port pre-loaded faceplates installed in the furniture, one at each workstation location.
c.	The faceplates are to be terminated with two data and two digital phone jacks in each. 
d.	The data cables are to be routed back to the communications closet and terminated on a contractor provided CAT 6 patch panel installed on the existing 6’x 19” LAN rack.
e.	Drop total (furniture mounted) is 88, 44 data and 44 phone drops at 22 locations in the modular furniture.

4.	CAT 6 Cabling (not in modular furniture)
A.	CAT 6 cabling will be routed from the communications closet in installed tray to drop locations throughout the building.
a.	It is understood that drops not located in modular furniture will be installed “down the wall” in “Latch Duct” and surface mounted boxes. 
b.	There are a total of 23 locations where it will be necessary to install a 4 port surface mount box with associated CAT 6 jacks and latch duct etc...
c.	Drop total (not in modular furniture) is 92, 54 data and 38 phone at 23 locations throughout the building.  At 4 locations there is a requirement for 4 data drops instead of the standard 2 data/2 phone configuration.

5.	Communications Room
A.

Note: Cartridges are a combination of OEM and remanufactured cartridges.<BR><BR>Brand Name Justification The planned procurement supports the newly established USPTO Tele-work and Patents Hoteling Programs. This procurement will also support the anticipated growth of the Patents Hoteling Program in FY2007 and for the next five years. The Patent Information Technology Product Support Division (PITPSD) provides Automated Information System (AIS) support for the USPTO and users of AIS used in the patent examining process and organizations, 1) desktop and tele-work systems, 2) OA hardware and software deployments, 3) network infrastructure configuration support, 4) AIS operational support and user training, 5) Automation consumable product procurement, 6) Asset Management, budgeting, and financial management. Currently, PITPSD provides toner cartridges for approximately 7,000 printers of which 1,500 are deployed to remote sites used by the patent hoteling participants. The work-at-home participants are provided with either a Dell 1600n or 1815n printer as part of the hardware configuration. Initially, all toner cartridges provided to the participants were new. As replacement toner was requested, PITPSD provided remanufactured brands, which resulted in a matrix of printer problems, hardware failures and loss of examining production time. The toner problems required the hoteling participants to make unscheduled visits to exchange the bad toner and in multiple cases they experienced the exact problems with the second remanufactured cartridge. The problems are well documented in a series of helpdesk tickets and e-mail correspondences. Because of these widespread adverse results, PITPSD requires the Dell brand name toner for the Dell 1600n and 1815n printers - which has solved the Dell printer problems for the Telework and Hoteling participants. The Dell brand name toner is also required because any product used in Dell printers other those manufactured by Dell may void the warranties. Moreover, the severity of printer problems is exacerbated by the fact that USPTO technical support for the Dell printers is not available at the 1,500 remote relocations.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is RFQ70024 and solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11. Delivery and acceptance will be at Bethesda, Maryland.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse has a requirement for expert in publication of articles. Background: The work includes three specific tasks, 1) editorial assistance with the expeditious publication of manuscripts containing scientific data generated in the Drug Design and Synthesis Section (DDS), Chemical Biology Research Branch (CBRB), NIDA, NIH, DHHS; 2) coordination of the establishment and management of existing and future databases of compounds prepared in DDS and necessary for its work; 3) Coordination and facilitation of the molecular modeling and quantum chemistry programs necessary for DDS.  Sufficient expertise and knowledge is required in these areas to allow efficient interaction with the Chief, DDS. 
To accomplish these tasks: 1) The contractor will discuss with scientists involved with the manuscript how the scientific work should be described to enable publication of a scientific manuscript in first-rate refereed journals, and the various steps that must be followed for the process. The contractor will keep the Chief, DDS, informed as to the progress of the manuscript; 2) Databases that the Chief, DDS, deem necessary for material gathered in the Section will be established under the guidance of the contractor to allow easy access by the Chief, DDS, and the members of the Section; 3) the theoretical chemistry (molecular modeling, quantum chemistry) needed for the work of the Section will be facilitated and overseen, when necessary, by the contractor.Organic/medicinal chemistry and pharmacology are the foundation for the multidisciplinary approach used in DDS research.  The work requires synthesis of novel agonists, antagonists, imaging agents, affinity ligands, and other drugs for specific applications. New, highly selective ligands for drug receptors are synthesized, using all of the contemporary tools of medicinal chemistry, including computer assisted molecular modeling. DDS (1) Plans, develops, and conducts research to obtain and evaluate new compounds for various types of pharmacological activity; (2) promotes the use of molecular modeling and quantum chemistry to determine structure-activity relationships; (3) develops synthetic routes and methodology as required for the design, synthesis, and testing of new therapeutic agents, (4) develops ligands for positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of drug receptors in the CNS of living animals and conscious humans; and (5) collaborates with other laboratories in the evaluation of new compounds. The data that are obtained from DDS studies are published in first-rate journals. It is essential that the research findings of DDS are made available to scientists, worldwide, through the expeditious publication of research findings, that the necessary databases for essential information be established and maintained, and that important theoretical concepts derived from molecular modeling and quantum chemistry be explained so that the scientists in the Section more fully understand them.  It has been determined that it is cost efficient and in the best interests of the Government to have a contractor perform the three tasks.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions:


QUESTION:  1.  The bid states under C, Collections, item 1: located throughout the world, we can not price a test that may be done anywhere. Are we reading this correctly?

  ANSWER:  1.  Yes, at times we have pre-employment tests that must be collected in other states.

QUESTION:  2.  The bid states under D, Collection site, item 1: designated by the USUHS, we need to know those locals in order to put a price to the drug testing. We do have our own collection sites that can be chosen from.

ANSWER:  2.  The Department of Health & Human Services provides a list of certified labs Federal agencies are to use for testing urine samples.


QUESTION:  3.  The bid states under E, Scheduling Collections, item 1: 24 hours per day,  is this for a regular collection or is this referring to the post-accident collections?

  ANSWER:  3.  The 24 hours per day pertains to post accidents.  Random testing will be conducted during normal working hours (8:00 am to 4:00 pm)


QUESTION:  4.  Finally, the bid requires semi-annual meetings by person or conference call; if it is by call than it doesn't impact our pricing, but if it is in person, than it does. We need to know which in order to give a proper rate.


  ANSWER:  4.  These meetings may be conducted by phone or in person.  This will depend on the nature of the meeting.ntract in accordance with HHS Guidelines.  Appropriate follow-on training for specific collectors is required on all collections not tested due to a fatal flaw or correctable flaw collection and when DPCs deem collector performance or behavior is inappropriate.  The training shall include formal instruction, mock/practice collections, observation of an experience collector at a random testing collection event and instruction on security of information and documents.  The contractor shall document training and retain records of all training for collector personnel which may be reviewed by the USUHS DPC or other appropriate USUHS or Department of Defense (DoD) Officials.

4. The contractor is responsible for obtaining and maintaining all licenses required in the accomplishment of the work specified.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to work with the DPC to obtain passes for the collectors.

5. Problem Resolution. The contractor and the USUHS DPC will meet on a semi-annual basis to discuss contract performance issues.  Meetings shall be in person or by conference call and shall be determined by the DPC.  Serious contract performance issues may require additional meeting with the contractor, DPC, and USUHS Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).  Problems with collection personnel will be handled through consultation, memos, and/or electronic messages to the contractor.

6. The contractor representative will be available for contact on a daily basis on normal work days which is defined as Monday through Friday (except federal holidays), between the hours of 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. and because of emergency collection activity and the location of USUHS DPC, the contractor representative will also need to be available at other times.  The contractor representative must be able to be reached by DPCs seven (7) days a week, 24 hours per day for reasonable suspicion or accident/unsafe practice testing.

7. The contractor representative will monitor collection activities as required for quality assurance and shall evaluate the work of the collectors.

8. The contractor representative will interface with the urinalysis laboratory.  This interaction will involve exchange of procedural and technical information, tracking of specimens, and completion of certificates of correction.  This communication shall be conducted and conveyed to the USUHS DPC.  The contractor must use laboratories certified by HHS to perform drug testing for Federal agencies. 

9. Collection personnel.  The contractor shall ensure that personnel assigned to perform urine specimen collections are aware of the sensitivity of the testing program and deal with the donors in a professional and cooperative manner, similar to expectations in a routine medical care setting, e.g., a physician's office.  Collection personnel must be able to answer routine questions about collection procedures.  Any questions concerning receipt of a drug test results must be directed to the DPC.  Collection personnel must pass any training provided by the prime contractor.  In the event that HHS mandates a training program, all collection personnel must pass this program.

C. Collections

1. The contractor shall provide for collection of urine specimens from USUHS/AFRRI civilian employees and applicants located throughout the world.  USUHS conducts six types of tests: random, voluntary, reasonable suspicion, accident or unsafe practice, and follow-up.

2. The contractor shall have the laboratory to test urine specimens for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).  In the case of reasonable suspicion or accident or unsafe practice testing, urine specimens shall be tested for any drugs listed in Schedules I and II of 21 U.S.C S202, 802(6), and 812 (attachment 1).  The laboratory must be certified by HHS.   

3. Single specimen collection is the normal collection method in USUHS and the Department of Defense (DoD).  Split specimen collection is only performed with DPC approval.

D. Collection Site

1. Designation - collection sites shall be designated by the USUHS DPC.

2. Specifications - the Government or the contractor collection site is the location for specified employees or applicants to present themselves for the purpose of providing their urine specimens under controlled conditions.  The collection site must have rest room facilities, which are clean, well lighted, and sufficiently secure to prevent compromise during the collection of urine specimens. The contractor is to notify the DPC immediately if a site fails to meet the above requirements so that immediate correction can be made (e.g. light burnt out in rest room).

3. The contractor shall be responsible for preparing the rest rooms for collection activities.  This may include taping all water sources.  

4. The contractor shall assure the portion of the facility being used for collection is secured during drug collection operations.  No unauthorized personnel shall be permitted in any part of the collection site where urine specimens are collected or stored.

5. If there is a disagreement as to whether the collection site meets the contract requirements, the DPC determination shall be final.

6. Government Collection Sites - generally, the collection site will be at one of the USUHS/AFRRI duty locations.  Random, voluntary, and follow-up collection will be conducted at a USUHS or AFRRI site or at a government site, unless otherwise authorized by the DPC.  

7. Contractor Collection Site - In unusual circumstances when a government facility does not meet the established collection site specifications, the DPC will arrange with the contractor for an outside collection site.  The contractor may be asked to recommend a location that is reasonably accessible 
to employees and applicants and meets the above collection site specifications.  In these cases, USUHS retains final approval authority.  

8. Pre-employment testing - the DPC may ask the contractor to recommend a location that is reasonably accessible to the applicant.  Reasonable accessible is defined as within one hour's driving time of the applicant or at a site in a major metropolitan city.  For purposes of this contract, major metropolitan area is defined as a metropolitan statistical area with a population greater than 150,000.  The contractor will provide a list of non-government drug testing facilities within the Washington, DC metropolitan area that can conduct drug testing for USUHS/AFRRI employees and/or applicants.

9. Reasonable suspicion and post-accident or unsafe practice testing may be conducted at a contractor collection site or another location (e.g. hospital) as specified by the DPC.  The DPC coordinating with site personnel will have final approval of the collection site.

E. Scheduling Collections

1. Collections may take place any time during a 24 hour day and any day of the week.  This means that collections will not be restricted to normal working hours, i.e., 6:00 a.m. to 5:00p.m., Monday through Friday.  However, normally collections will be conducted during the normal workday.

2. The DPC is responsible for managing the actual scheduling, rescheduling of the dates and times and sites for collections and individual collections with the contractor.  The DPC will notify the contractor of drug testing dates and times via telephone, fax, e-mail, or other method agreed upon.

3. The contractor will notify the DPC within 24 hours after the receipt of a request for drug testing to resolve scheduling conflicts and confirm the collection time and date.  The DPC will perform all donor notifications.  The contractor shall not unilaterally cancel or reschedule a collection.

4. In scheduling collection times, the contractor must recognize that if a donor(s) is unable to provide a specimen when first requested, the contractor will notify the DPC immediately.  The donor is required to remain at the collection site until ready to provide a specimen.  When a donor is unable to provide a specimen, the following procedures shall apply:

	a. When other collections are scheduled at the same location to be performed by the same collector, the contractor shall perform these collections while waiting for the unsuccessful donor to provide a specimen.

	b. The contractor need not wait more than four (4) hours beyond the last collection for a donor to provide a specimen at a Government collection site.  The contractor may impose a fee to USUHS for additional wait time.  The fee will equal one test (of the type being collected) per 30 minutes of wait time.  The wait time will start 30 minutes after the last scheduled collection.  The USUHS liability shall not exceed the price of eight collections (four hours).  If the donor provides a specimen within 30 minutes of the last scheduled collection, the fee will not be imposed.

c. The DPC may, at his/her option, order the contractor to cancel the collection at any time.  The above wait time fees will be imposed.

5. During drug testing at a USUHS/AFRRI collection site, the DPC will normally be present to answer any donor questions during the collection process or in the event of a shy bladder situation.  If the DPC can not be present, a telephone or other means of contacting the DPC must be made available to the collector(s).  Any problems occurring during a collection will be documented and forwarded to the DPC.

6. Although every effort is made to complete collections on the date and time scheduled, there are a variety of circumstances requiring postponement and rescheduling of collections.  If the DPC must cancel an on-site collection after it has been scheduled and confirmed with the collector, the DPC shall do so as early as practicable, but in any case at least 24 hours before the scheduled collection event.  Collections scheduled at the contractor's site that must be canceled should be done as soon as practicable.  Collections must be canceled by telephone either confirming verbally with the prime contractor or by leaving a voice and an e-mail message.  If the cancellation is after normal working hours Eastern Standard Time (normal working hours is defined in section E.1), the DPC shall contact the contractor by pager or cell phone.  Fees may be imposed on USUHS for Government site collections cancelled in less than 24 hours.  The fee will be the cost of one drug test (of the type scheduled).  There will be no fees assessed for cancelled contractor site collections.

7. When a drug testing event must be rescheduled, the DPC and the contractor will determine a new collection date.  

8. The collector(s) shall arrive at the Government testing site not later than 15 minutes before the collections are scheduled.  In the event the contractor does not arrive for the scheduled collection in a timely manner and is not ready to begin collections at the scheduled time, the contractor will be liable for liquidated damages for one drug test (of the type of test scheduled) for every 15 minutes the collector is not ready, up to a maximum liability of two drug tests/collections.  If the collector does not appear at the Government collection site, the contractor will be liable for the cost of two drug tests (of the type scheduled for collection).

9. In the event the contractor arrives at the Government collection site on schedule but no donor is present, ready, and available for a collection, the USUHS shall pay the contractor the contract price for one drug test (of the type of test scheduled) for the first complete 30 minutes that no donor is present, ready, and available for collection.  The USUHS liability is limited to the price of one test.  After one hour of delay, the contractor, at its option, may leave the site.

10. Random, Volunteer, and Follow-up Collections - For these types of collections, the DPC will provide the contractor with the number of employees scheduled and the specific start time at least five (5) calendar days prior to the drug testing event.  The DPC may request that the collector personnel be a specific gender, if deemed necessary.  The contractor shall adhere strictly to the schedule established and given by the DPC and shall be prepared to begin collections at the requested times.  The date, time and number of collections should not be disclosed to any other personnel not directly involved with the collection.  Upon arrival at the collection site, the DPC will give the collector the donor name and time of collection for each collection.  This information shall remain confidential.

11. Pre-employment Collections - drug testing is required of all individuals tentatively selected for a Testing Designated Position (TDP).  Pre-employment collections may be conducted at a Government or a contractor site as determined by the DPC.  The contractor will provide the DPC with a list of non-government drug testing facilities within the Washington, DC metropolitan area that can conduct drug testing for USUHS/AFRRI employees and/or applicants.  If the applicant is outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the DPC will notify the contractor as early as possible but in any case at least 24 hours in advance of a pre-employment drug test.  In exceptional cases, the contractor may be asked to conduct a test in less than 24 hours after notification by the DPC when possible.  The DPC shall notify the contractor of the name, social security number, gender, earliest date for testing, and city and state of applicant to be tested.  If the collection is to take place at a contractor site, the contractor shall furnish the DPC with a local point-of-contact's name and telephone number for the pre-employment test.  The contractor will coordinate with the DPC to schedule a specific time and place.  Applicants do not have the authority to change the drug test date, time, or location.  If the applicant requests a change, the contractor is to direct the applicant to the DPC.  If the applicant does not appear for testing within one (1) hour of the scheduled time, the DPC must be notified immediately.

12. Reasonable Suspicion and Accident or Unsafe Practice Collections - these types of collections may be conducted at a contractor site or another location as determined by the DPC.  Reasonable suspicion is authorized when management has a reasonable suspicion that any employee in a TDP is using drugs illegally.  Employees in a non-TDP may onl

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK: 

A. General Description

The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the President's Executive Order (E.O.) 12564 address the goals of establishing a drug-free workplace for the public and private sector. The E.O. 12564 directed agencies to establish a program to test for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions.  

The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires a contractor to perform drug testing for USUHS and Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute (AFRRI) employees in accordance with:  a) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs ( 53 Federal Register-FR 1979, 59 FR 29908, 63 FR, No. 219, and FR volume 69, No. 71); b) HHS Medical Review Officer Manual for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs; c) HHS Urine Specimen Collection Handbook for the New Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (OMB Number 0930?0158, Exp Date: June 30, 2003); the Statement of Work herein; and e) USUHS Drug-Free Workplace Program Instruction 1412 (May 27, 2004).

The Secretary of HHS or his/her designee may routinely update the HHS Guidelines for the purpose of providing additional guidance.  The contractor shall be required to obtain and comply with updates of the HHS Guidelines as they are issued.

USUHS conducts urinalysis testing to detect and deter illegal drug use by its civilian employees.  USUHS is required to conduct random, reasonable suspicion, accident or unsafe practice, pre-employment, volunteer, and follow-up drug testing.  This contract will provide for collection of urine specimens from USUHS/AFRRI civilians and applicants for USUHS Testing Designated Positions (TDP).

<CONTACT>Debra Ann Rosa, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-295-3962, Fax 301-295-1716, Email drosa@usuhs.mil - Christina Johnson, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 295-3069, Fax (301) 295-1716, Email cjohnson@usuhs.mil
<DESC>The following question and answer were posed:

Q:  What is the likelihood that collections can be done at our two DC metro area clinics.  I am asking because under Collections Site 2. It states that only in unusual circumstances when a government facility does not meet the established collection site specifications, the DPC will arrange with the contractor for an outside collections site.  Under Collections 1. What resources are available to expedite drug testing for applicants located throughout the world?  Collection centers etc.

A:  We only refer pre-employment applicants to outside locations.  If an applicant is in another state, the contractor will have to provide an approved lab (approved by Health and Human Services) to perform the test.

y be tested when management has a reasonable suspicion that the employee is using drugs illegally on-duty or performing work while drug-impaired.  Accident or Unsafe Practice may also be called post?-accident testing.  Employees may be subject to testing when, based upon the circumstances of the on-the-job accident or unsafe, on-duty, job-related activity, their actions are reasonably suspected of having caused or contributed to an accident or unsafe practice.

	a. Reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing have often been termed emergency testing due to the short time frame available for scheduling the collection.  Such requests may occur at any time or day of the week and at any location.  The contractor shall respond as expeditiously as possible after notification from the DPC or other authorized USUHS official.  The DPC will notify the contractor by telephone, pager, or cell phone to schedule a collection.  Official requesting documentation via fax (or electronic e?mail) will follow this conversation.  The contractor shall notify the DPC of the collection time within one (1) hour of receiving the request for collection.  A collection team may be used and a same gender collector is required in the event an observed collection is necessary.

	b. Whenever practicable, a post-accident or unsafe practice collection shall be completed within two (2) hours of the accident/incident.  Two (2) hours from the accident/incident is the desired time frame; however, this is dependent on the timing of the notification that a collection is required.  Five (5) hours from notification is the maximum time frame.

	c. Whenever practicable, a reasonable suspicion collection shall be completed within two (2) hours of the request for collection, but not later five (5) hours. 

F. Collection Procedures

1. All collection procedures shall be adhered to whether at the Government collection site or the contractor collection site and will follow the HHS Guidelines, Subpart B, Section 2.2 Specimen Collection Procedures.

2. The collector(s) shall arrive at the Government collection site not later than 15 minutes before collections are scheduled to begin in order to prepare the site.  The contractor is responsible for being ready to perform collections at the scheduled time.  The collector(s) shall provide identification to the DPC.  The DPC will provide the collectors with a list of donors and their arrival time.  Failure of a donor to report for testing and the inability to adhere to the schedule shall be reported immediately to the DPC.

3. Upon the donor's arrival at the Government or the contractor collection site, the collector shall identify themselves to the donor and request the donor to present some type of photo identification. If the donor does not have proper identification, the collector shall determine if the DPC can positively identify the donor.

4. If the donor fails to appear at the assigned time, the collector shall contact the DPC for guidance. Pre-employment donors must arrive within one (1) hour of the collection time.  Collectors must notify the DPC immediately when a donor fails to arrive on time.

5. Upon receiving the specimen container from the donor, the collector shall determine whether it contains at least 30 milliliters of urine and preferably 45 milliliters of urine.  If there is not sufficient urine, the DPC shall be notified immediately that a second specimen is required.  The DPC or collector will instruct the donor to drink fluids and tell him/her where to wait until ready to provide another specimen.  The donor will stay in sight of the DPC or collector.  When a second specimen is collected, the collector will note on the custody and control form the time that the insufficient specimen was discarded (e.g. insufficient specimen @ 1315) in the remarks section of the Chain of Custody Form (CCF).

6.  If the donor is not able to provide a specimen, the DPC or collector will instruct the donor to drink fluids and tell him/her where to wait until ready to provide a specimen.  It will be the responsibility of agency management to direct an employee to remain at the collection site for any additional time period.  

7. Immediately after collection, the collector shall, in the presence of the donor, measure the temperature of the specimen and conduct an inspection to determine the specimen's color and odor to identify signs of contaminants.  Any unusual findings resulting from the inspection shall be included on the custody and control form.  If the temperature of the specimen is outside the range of 32-38 C/90-100 F, this gives rise to reasonable suspicion of adulteration or substitution.  After consultation with and approval by the DPC, another specimen shall be collected under direct observation.  If the temperature of the specimen is outside the range and the collector is not the same gender, the DPC may select a same gender observer.  Both specimens must be forwarded to the laboratory for testing.  Any specimen suspected to be adulterated should always be forwarded for testing per HHS Guidelines, Subpart B, Section 2.2, (f) (15).

8. Both the donor and the collector should keep the specimen in view at all times prior to it being sealed and labeled.  The collector shall direct the donor to initial and date the identification label on the specimen bottle.  If the donor does not follow these directions, the collector will write a memorandum for the record (MFR) stating that the donor was directed to write his/her initials on the label but declined to do so. This MFR will be enclosed with the CCF copy and sent to the laboratory.

9. Collection under direct observation shall never be made except with authorization from the DPC. Direct observation will be authorized only when the activity has reason to believe that the donor may or has altered or substituted the specimen.  The collector must be the same gender as the donor.  If the donor and collector are not the same gender, the DPC will select an observer of the same gender.

10. Split Specimen Collections - these procedures may only be used with prior approval of the USUHS DPC.  Split specimens will only be collected for random, follow-up, volunteer, reasonable suspicion or post-accident testing.  All HHS Guidelines will be followed when using split specimen procedures.

G. Identification and Recording of Urine Specimens

1. USUHS will be using the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF), OMB No. 0930-0158 or succeeding forms.  The identification labels on specimen bottles shall contain the date, the donor's initials, and a specimen ID number and a bar code (specimen ID number).  
The kit box/bag seal shall contain the collector's signature and date.

2. If the donor refuses to provide a social security number (SSN), the DPC shall provide the contractor with a number consisting of the activity UIC and a number identifying the individual.

3. The CCF copy will distributed as follows: Copy 1 will be sent with the specimen to the laboratory via overnight delivery; Copy 2 will be faxed to the MRO (legible copy) and the original will be sent by U.S. Mail to the MRO; Copy 3 will be retained by the collector; Copy 4 will be given to the DPC.  In cases where the collection was not done on the DPC's site, the copy will be sent by U.S. Mail to the DPC; and Copy 5 will be given to the donor at the time of the collection.

4. In the event that errors in the completion of the CCF are made by collection personnel and these errors can not be corrected by affidavit and results in the rejection of the specimen for testing by the laboratory, the contractor will be responsible for the cost of the rejected specimen(s).  USUHS will not be charged for these rejected specimen(s).  If errors made can be corrected by affidavit, the contractor will provide the affidavit correcting the error to the laboratory or MRO.

H. Transportation of Specimens

1. Specimens must be shipped overnight delivery to the laboratory at the conclusion of a drug testing event.  Should the time between collection and shipment exceed 24 hours, the USUHS DPC must be notified in writing of the circumstances.

3. Collection supplies to collectors for time sensitive collections (pre-employments, reasonable suspicion, and post-accident) may be sent by overnight delivery.

4. All transportation fees are paid by the contractor.

5. The contractor shall retain written evidence of shipping.  Written evidence may consist of a certified mail receipt, registered mail receipt, bill of lading, overnight air bill, etc.  The number of specimens per shipment shall be noted.  The contractor must maintain a copy for tracking purposes.

6. The contractor is responsible for placing traces on lost shipments and will report all such cases as well as the results of the contractor's inquiry to the DPC.

7. The risk of loss or damage to specimens that occurs while in shipment or that were improperly prepared by the collector (e.g. no accompanying custody and control form) shall remain with the contractor.  At the DPC?s direction, the contractor shall recollect all specimens not received, damaged, or improperly prepared for testing by the laboratory at no cost to the Government.  In addition, as liquidated damages, the contractor will pay the cost equal to the number of specimens lost, damaged, or improperly prepared for the type of tests collected.

8. The Custody and Control Form copies shall be distributed in accordance with the HHS Guidelines.

I. Supplies

1. The contractor shall provide all necessary supplies for the collection of the urine specimens to include, but not limited to: catch containers (individually wrapped); specimen bottles with temperature strip; bluing agent; tape; pens; thermometer; gloves; plastic pouch with absorbent pad; mailing boxes; Federal Custody & Control Forms (OMB #0930-0158); collection kits.

2. The custody and control forms (OMB #0930-0158) provided by the contractor must be bar coded (specimen ID number) on the form and the seals.  The identification number must be unique.  Any changes to the basic CCF as provided by the regulations must be approved by the USUHS DPC in advance.

J. Quality Control/Blind Sample Specimens

1. The contractor shall provide and submit quality control/blind samples to the laboratory at the minimum rate of 3% of the total number of specimens submitted per quarter as specified in HHS Guidelines, Subpart B, Section 2.5, (k).   

2. The contractor must develop and carry out a procedure for packaging the blind samples and distributing them from the designated testing location to the laboratory.  This shall be done in a manner such that the laboratory will not be able to identify the origination of the samples as control samples.  The procedures for processing and submitting blind samples will be in accordance with HHS Guidelines.

K. Specimen Security and Record Keeping

1. In order to assure that each urine specimen is properly identified and not accidentally confused with any other specimen, strict chain of custody procedures shall always be used by the collector when collecting and transferring the sample.  While performing any part of the chain of custody procedures, the contractor shall assure the urine specimen and custody documents are always under the total control of the collector.  If the collector must leave his/her workstation, the specimens and custody forms shall be taken with him/her or must be secured.  Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of persons handling the specimens in order to maximize the overall security of the specimens.

2. The Federal Custody and Control Form (CCF), shall be utilized for the purpose of maintaining control and accountability from initial collection to final disposition of all specimens.  The form will adhere to HHS specifications.  The form will identify the specimen through use of information, which matches label items, a unique number assigned to each urine specimen obtained, and bar coding.

3. The contractor shall establish and maintain the records required in a secure filing system. The records shall be maintained for a minimum of five (5) years.  The contractor will notify USUHS of any actual or attempted breach of security either with the hard copy or electronic files.

4. Destruction of records shall be in a manner that precludes any unauthorized release of information.

5. All documents or forms used in collection of urine for testing must be approved by the USUHS before use.

6. All forms or documents containing names and social security numbers must be kept according to Privacy Act requirements.

The reports shall be submitted no later than two (2) weeks following the end of the reporting month.  The report format, content, and appearance are subject to DPC approval.

2.  At a minimum, this report shall contain the following: dollar amount for each test; balance to be collected; number of specimens collected; date of collection; type of test(s); number of quality control specimens; any special comments. 

M. Quality Assurance Plan

1. The contractor shall maintain an internal quality assurance program which encompasses all aspects of the collection and transportation of urine specimens including: site/collection scheduling; collection procedures; chain of custody; security; overall professional and appropriate conduct; and procedures for resolving problems.  The contractor shall provide USUHS with the contractor's 
Quality Assurance Plan within two (2) months of the effective date of the contract.  USUHS has final approval of the Quality Assurance Plan.

2. The contractor is responsible for updating the Quality Assurance Plan with any procedural changes that may occur.

N. Testimony

1. The contractor shall make personnel and documentation available, whenever requested in writing by the USUHS DPC or appropriate agency official.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to 1) provide answers to questions from industry and 2) to modify a specification previously posted.  

NIST hereby amends Solicitation Number SB1341-07-RQ-0132 as follows:

QUESTION:
1) What is the maximum capacity of the Instron model 4482 machine (in either kN, lbs, or kgs)

ANSWER:
The Model 4482 is a floor-mounted universal testing machine with a maximum capacity of 100 kN.


QUESTION:
2) What is the manufacture year of the machine?

ANSWER:
August 2001


QUESTION:
3) What load cell capacity is used with this machine (if more than one load cell is used, please list all capacities)

ANSWER:
A range of load cells are currently available to us.  Depending on the application, our work with this machine has used load cells ranging from 100 lbf (500 N, Instron catalog #2525-816) up to 20000 lbf (100 kN, Instron catalog #2525-801).


QUESTION:
4) What accessories are used with this machine (grips, special fixtures, extensometers other than the listed video extensometer)?

ANSWER:
The primary accessories are:
a. Pneumatic Grip Control (Instron Series 2701)
b. Pneumatic Cord & Yarn Grips (Instron catalog #2714-006)
c. For clarification the current extensometer was not described.  It is a non-contacting video extensometer [Instron catalog #2663-307, Type
3(PCI-Bus)]
d. Standard compression platens


QUESTION:
5) Can you provide photos of the machine (full frame photo, photo of the drive system, photo of electronics)?

ANSWER:
One is a full load frame photo; one is a close-up of the control panel; and one is a close-up of the video extensometer and grips presently installed on the machine.  Also, in the full load frame photo, one can see the orange foot pedal that is a component of item (a) above (the pneumatic grip control).  

For a copy of the requested pictures, send requests to jroderic@nist.gov.

The drive system and electronic system within the load frame are enclosed and not readily viewable, although they should not have to be modified.  The control panel, which is attached to the right load column, contains other electronic components that are the subject of this solicitation.  The control panel, in our present configuration, has six cables attached to it:

1) Interface with the strain measurement system
2) Interface with the load measurement system
3) IEEE cable interface with a separate computer
4) Interface with the drive system of the load frame
5) Power cable drawing power from the load frame
6) Ground cable

A few other cable ports are open on the back side of the control panel.
The control unit is sealed and interior photos of it are not available.



The following language is hereby changed as follows:

FROM:
"All vendors must be capable of upgrading existing equipment, the Instron 4482 and all systems quoted must be compatible with our current video extensometer, the Instron 5565 System P31418 60 Hz video extensometer, or a non-contact extensometer that is compatible with the new equipment must be included in the quotation."

It is not the "Instron 5565 System P31418 60 Hz video extensometer" described in the solicitation.  When Instron last calibrated our video extensometer, the "5565" happens to be the testing system on which they performed the calibration, but that is not the correct designation for the extensometer itself.  Unfortunately, it is not obvious what the model number is for the extensometer.  The calibration paperwork lists it as "Part #A1697-3060".  The reference manual describes it as a "non-contacting Type 3(PCI-Bus) video extensometer."   Information provided by Instron, when the extensometer was purchased in 2004, describes it as a non-contacting 60 Hz video extensometer whose catalog number is 2663-307.  

TO:
"All vendors must be capable of upgrading existing equipment, the Instron 4482 and all systems quoted must be compatible with our current video extensometer, which is a non-contact Type 3(PCI-Bus) 60 Hz video extensometer by Instron, Catalog #2663-307.  Otherwise, a non-contact extensometer that is compatible with the new equipment must be included in the quotation."

All other terms and conditions remain the same.

Proposal Conference
Wednesday, March 28, 2007,1:00 p.m.

NOTES


Overview
Project 1 - CDC:  We need a contractor to manage all the procurements of the Child Development Center (CDC).  Our goal is to open the CDC on September 10, 2007.  The CDC will be a LEED commercial interior space.  We have been very specific in the RFP in requesting the LEED products and have asked for brand name specifics.  If the brand names are not available, the company is to find a suitable replacement.  The replacement must be approved by the SEC in writing.  We are on a very tight schedule and require delivery of the CDC products in mid August as requested in the RFP.  Lead times are critical.
Project 2-SEC Replacement Furniture:  Any LEEDs related requirements for this project would be identified in the individual Task Order.  Contractor is required to purchase replacement furniture for the SEC offices nationwide.
Question/Answers/Clarifications 
[Please note that the questions will be numbered to reflect a continuation of the questions that were asked and answered in previous amendments on FEDBIZOPS.  This will allow for clarity of identification of questions when referencing.]
SECTION B.1  Comprehensive Furniture Management Services (CFMS), Child Development Center (CDC)
Line Item 0002-Administration of the CFMS Program
Question 26:	The RFP requests the contractor to provide a FFP for administration of the CFMS program.  Why cannot the contractor bill the SEC until the end of the project?:
Response:	 This is a fixed price requirement. The administration price is a subprice.  The contractor can bill for everything else throughout the process.  This line item can be billed at the very end.  It is the SECs incentive to get the job completed.
Question 27:	Line item 1 is for product, Line Item 2 is for service?
Response:  	Yes.
Question/Comment 28:   In our industry, we are usually allowed to bill for administrative costs up to a certain percent throughout the procurement of the items.  A small percentage is left to invoice by the time the work is completed. Will you revisit this issue?  It is hard on the contractor to receive payment in this manner.
Response:	 The SEC will take this under advisement and revisit this issue.  We will determine if we will revise this requirement or if it will remain the same.
Question/Comment 29:	How about attaching the administrative costs to some milestones or tying the costs to the deliverables?
Response:	The SEC will take this under advisement and comment via an Amendment to the Solicitation.
Question 30:	Are you entertaining an hourly rate at all?
Response:	No.  
Line Item 0003-Warehousing of items
Note:	Remember - The SEC will entertain assembly on-site on a case by case basis, for example, the assembling of the large loft for the CDC.
Question 31:	Where will the acceptance punch list be approved?  How will it occur?
Response:	The acceptance punch list for the contract will be approved on site at the SECs CDC.  The Contractor is responsible for the acceptance for the initial acceptance upon purchase from the vendor.  The SEC will have an acceptance punch list done on the day the product is installed at the CDC.  It is up to the Contractor to assure safe delivery of items to the CDC.
Question 32:	Can we assume that no other contractors will be in that space after delivery of items?  This question pertains to the security of the items.
Response:	Yes, the plan is that no one except SEC authorized personnel and the Contractor will be in the space during the timeframe authorized for delivery.  This is a highly secure facility.  The security systems start once the equipment/furniture/toys are delivered.  The COTR or a designated SEC representative will be with the contractor upon delivery of the items.
Question 33:	Who will have control of the CDC security during the installation?

Line Item 0005-Storage Fee for authorized delay in delivery 
Note:  Clarification.  This line item is placed in the RFP in the event of delays caused and authorized by the SEC.  This will be tied to a milestone.  The qty/unit is PER SQUARE FOOT PER DAY as noted in the amendments.
Question 34:	Is there any licensing going on here?
Response:	Yes there is, through Washington, DC.
Question 35:	Licensing requires furniture to be in place?
Response:	Yes.
SECTION B.2 ? Comprehensive Furniture Management Services (CFMS), Commission-wide Program to Replace and Upgrade Office Furniture (SEC Offices)
NOTE:  This is Project No. 2.  It is the IDIQ part of the Contract.  The SEC is looking for other options for furniture purchase.  This requirement runs the gamut of what you would see in a typical office.  For the administration fee for this effort, the Contractor will quote a percentage of the task order.  This is a standalone SEC Contract, NOT under GSA.
Line Item 0007-Administration of the CFMS task order requirements
Question 36:  	Our GSA contract requires an hourly rate for the fee.
Question/Comment 37:	This takes away the contractors incentive to buy discount.  Would you consider an hourly rate with a percentage cap?
Response to Questions 36 and 37:	The SEC will take these questions and comments into consideration.  Any change will be noted in an Amendment to the Solicitation.
Question 38:	If the furniture goes out of region, would it impact the hourly rate for 0007?
Response:	No.  The big delta is on installation.
Question 39:	Is the SEC looking for hourly rates now or do you want hourly rates later?
Response:	Now.  We need as much up front information  as possible.
Question 40:	Can we get a breakdown of the number of  SEC employees by location and the square foot of each location?  Also, can we get the floor number for each location and the loading dock specifications?
Response:	The SEC will provide the number of SEC employees by location, the square feet of each SEC location, and the floor number for each location via Amendment to the Solicitation on FEDBIZOPS.  We will provide the loading dock specifications for each location if required during the task order process.
Question 41:	Will the results of this meeting be posted for all parties?
Response:	Yes.
Other Questions/Comments:
Question 42:	You said you would accept e-mail for the proposal delivery.  You also requested 1 hard copy to follow.  Do you need more than 1 hard copy?  How large of a file can you receive electronically?
Response:	Yes, e-mail is acceptable for the delivery date of 9 April 2007, 4:30 PM EST.  The hard copy should follow.  We are going to request 1 original and 3 hard copies of the proposal to be sent overnight (express) to be received no later than 10 April 2007, 4:30 PM EST.  We will respond via Amendment to answer the size of electronic file that can be received via e-mail.  We will send an e-mail receipt of proposal delivery.
Question 43:	What will be the turn around time after the proposals have been received?
Response:	Turnaround time depends on the amount of proposals received.  We would like to make award within two weeks, but it depends on the complexity and volume of proposals received.
Question 44:	Under corporate experience, you request experience between the years 2003-2005.  Did you mean 2006?
Response:	We will change to reflect corporate experience needed for the past 3 years, 2004-2006.
Question 45:	By using the word, commercial, are you meaning projects of this scope or a private vs. commercial effort?
Response:	We are talking about the flavor or type of the project.  It does not matter if it was for a private industry or commercial industry.
Question 46:	Is there going to be an award debrief?
Response:	No, unless it is requested.  If requested, we will do an award debrief.
Question 47:	What is the square footage of the CDC?
Response:	It is on the CD that you received.
