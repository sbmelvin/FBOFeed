<ARCHDATE>01312009
<CONTACT>Gerri Voto-Braun  Contracting Officer 4062477809     gvoto@gp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation announces its intention to negotiate Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the procurement of professional surveying services consisting of leveling, construction, geodetic, boundary, topographic, route, hydrographic, control, and cadastral surveys, Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) land base grid creation and analysis,  and the use of GPS and laser scanner technologies for projects within the Great Plains Region.  These services are to be provided on a firm, fixed-price task order basis in the states of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  The contracts will be negotiated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 36, as implemented by Departmental and Agency regulations and directives. The performance period will be for one year beginning on the date of contract award, with four pre-priced optional years.  The options may be exercised solely at the discretion of the Government without further competition.  The cumulative orders over the life of the contract may not exceed $1,000,000.  Principal items of professional surveying services are as follows: 1. Perform services under individual fixed-price task orders in any of the above referenced disciplines in any of the specified states.   2. There will be a maximum of two contracts awarded as a result of these negotiations.  3. The maximum order limitation for any task order placed under this contract will be $100,000, with cumulative orders over the life of the contract(s) not to exceed $1,000,000.   4. The minimum order guarantee per contract, per year will be $3,000.   Competent firms suitably staffed to perform the required services are invited to submit four copies of a current Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications.  In addition to the Standard Form 330, interested companies shall submit a minimum of three (3) Past Performance Questionnaires from previous federal projects.  The SF-330 and Past Performance Questionnaires must be received in this office no later than 2:00 PM on February 29, 2008.   The proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:   1. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Include your firm's Registered Professional Surveyors' experience in similar surveys for the states in which the work is to be performed.  2. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required.  List years of experience in similar surveys for the key personnel that will be involved on projects if awarded the contract.  3. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Identify your firm's equipment, personnel availability, and management and quality control procedures used to ensure reasonable deadlines are met and quality deliverables are produced.  4. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. The Government intends to award up to two contracts to provide professional surveying services to meet the survey requirements of the entire Great Plains Region.  Therefore, each firm needs to be able to provide professional surveying services for all nine states within the Great Plains Region.  If one firm is not able to provide these services and technologies for the entire region, they would need to subcontract with other firms so that they are able to meet the surveying requirements of the entire region.  Accordingly, any proposed subcontractor(s) and their SF-330's shall be included in the proposal at the time they are due.   Following the initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, the Government will initiate negotiations with the highest-rated firms.  If the Government and the firms are able to reach agreement on fair and reasonable pricing, a contract award will be made.  If not, then the Government will terminate negotiations and then initiate negotiations with the next highest rated firm.  Award of the IDIQ contract for professional surveying does not in and of itself guarantee the contractor(s) all survey work within the Great Plains Region.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right and authority to procure survey work through full and competition in response to the specific business needs as determined by the Great Plain's Chief of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>1.1 General.  The contractor shall furnish to NAMSA two sets of portable, manually operated, vehicle wash racks and related equipment. Two identical wash racks, each with two bays, with one wash rack for each of two major headquarters camps will be required.  Both wash racks will operate independently, but will feature interchangeable components. Each set of equipment will be installed in conjunction with two concrete washing bays that will be installed by others.  

These wash rack facilities, featuring manually operated high pressure washers, environmentally acceptable oil and grit separators and filters, water recycling, and collection and settlement tanks are each intended to provide effective, low maintenance, vehicle washing equipment to approximately 100 military and civilian vehicles per day.  

These wash facilities will be used over a wide range of geographic environments and climatic conditions.  

Accordingly, NATO expects the equipment to be robust and of high quality, capable of providing reliable vehicle wash systems 
under difficult conditions, that can be operated whenever the weather is above freezing. 

1.2  Wash Racks.  A two-bay vehicle wash rack will use hand held, high pressure water sprayers to remove dirt from military and civilian vehicles varying from SUV type vehicles including military land rovers and Humvees, to tractor trailer vehicles and low loading trailers.  The wash rack will use water at ambient temperature with no detergent added. 

Only occasional track vehicles will use the bays but a range of cranes, fork lifts, and front end loaders, as well as heavy military cargo trucks, is expected to use the facility.  Dirt will range from dust, heavy clay, to laterite soil and will routinely include stone up to 50 mm in diameter.  Some road salt will also be expected.  Conservation of water, the drainage of excess rainwater and the preventing of oils, greases, and other hydrocarbons from escaping to the environment, are important aspects of the requirement. 

1.3   Vehicle Wash Bays.  Each wash bay is required to accept vehicles 20 m long on a drive through basis.  These bays must be capable of handling vehicles as large as a tractor towing a trailer carrying a 6.058 m ISO container or an unloaded low loader.  

The wash bays, featuring hand held pressure washers, will contain the wash water during and after the wash and collect it for recycling.  Prior to returning the water, the heaviest material will settle out on the wash rack floor, where it can be easily removed with shovels or mechanical means.  The wash bay floor will be provided by others. 

1.4      Water Collection and Settlement.   The run off wash water, with the heaviest particles left on the wash rack, would drain from both bays into a central collection and settlement tank.  Further clarification would occur in this tank, with clarified water overflowing into a wet well for further
processing.  The settlement tank, consisting of a reinforced ISO container that is set below grade, would be cleaned as necessary using a backhoe.    

1.5      Wash Water Recycling System. Partially clarified water from the wet well would be drawn into the water treatment system that was located in adapted ISO container.  

Hydrocarbon residue, remaining grit including road salt when present, and any other impurities would be filtered from the system to allow the water to be reused.  A minimum amount of make up water would be added to the system when necessary.  

Surplus water added by precipitation would be discharged from the system only after impurities, particularly hydrocarbons, have been removed.

2.0       Climatic and Geographical Conditions 

2.1       Climatic and Geographic Conditions are based on Allied 
Environmental Conditions and Test Publication (AECTP)-200(3) for the range of A1 to C1 Climatic Zones.  

The equipment described shall be capable of remaining functional under these environmental conditions, although it is not intended that the equipment operate when the temperature is below 0.

2.2       The equipment shall support steady winds of upto 31m/s and shall remain safe under gusts up to 52m/s coming from any side. 

2.3       The equipment, even when not in use, must be designed to withstand, without damage, temperatures below freezing, snow, and ice accumulation applicable to these climatic zones. 

3.0   Transportability.    

3.1   Loose material will be transported in containers (supplied by others) that will meet the structural specifications normally associated with ISO standard sea freight containers. Shipping containers shall have the overall (outside) dimensions of a 6058 mm ISO container but be limited in height to 2438mm with a width also of 2438 mm. The gross weight shall not exceed 14,000 kg when ready for transport.  Containers will meet all of the ISO 668 specifications. 

3.2   All containers are subject to off road movement by the military Deployable Rapid Operations Platform System (DROPS) for container handling.  It is important that the internal fittings, packaging, and dunnaging withstand such conditions, in particular the steep angle of loading and unloading.  All external DROPS equipment beyond that implicit in an ISO container will be supplied by others. 

4.0      Integrated Logistics Support  

4.1      In order to minimize in-service support costs, NAMSA requires the contractor to conduct an Integrated Logistics Support programme as an integral part of his system design and development.  This integrated programme shall ensure that logistics support matters such as equipment reliability, maintenance, sparing, and training, are considered in the 
development of the proposal and in the design and production of the equipment.  

The Integrated Logistics Support requirement is achieved through the identification of equipment failures, the identification of component reliability, and the development of an optimum sparing, maintenance, and training programme that minimizes life cycle costs and achieves the expected operational availability. It is supported by documentation and data, all of which are related through the NAMSA information management system.  

4.2      The Integrated Logistics Support requirement remains applicable for both the COTS equipment and the purpose built equipment, although the tasks and analyses are expected to be tailored to recognize the maturity of the equipment.  

4.3       A 30 day spare parts package and a training package would be requested.  A critical 2 year parts list, additional spare parts, contractor assisted maintenance, and depot level maintenance would be included at the time of Invitation for Bid (IFB).

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airport Technology Research and Development Branch, Operation of New Large Aircraft (NLA) Research Program, in cooperation with the Air Force Research Laboratory, is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to evaluate specialized Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles and equipment that are capable of performing multiple tasks at an aircraft incident.  Traditional ground ladders used for accessing aircraft can be dangerous to climb, extremely difficult to secure to the airplane, require multiple firefighters to setup, and do not always reach the desired aircraft exit. Some airports have structural ladder trucks, sky lifts or air stairs, but these vehicles take time to deploy and were not intended for ARFF operations.  The FAA is seeking information on vehicles, methods, or technologies that will provide firefighter access and passenger evacuation into a variety of aircraft, including NLA, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8, and perform firefighting operations.  Of particular interest are vehicle which can quickly deploy and be able to accommodate a variety of aircraft exit door orientations, including second-level access.  The FAA may also consider evaluation of evacuation/access vehicles that do not currently have ARFF capabilities (but have potential to be modified to accommodate this type of equipment) for use on the second-level, of a double-deck aircraft.    A technical review will be conducted of all responses.  Responses found to be technically sound may be requested to participate in further evaluation at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida (just outside Panama City).   Responses will be accepted until December 31, 2008.  Both email and U.S. mail submittals will be accepted.  Please send U.S. mail responses to Mr. Keith Bagot, FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, ARFF Research Program, AAR-411, Bldg 296, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey, 08405, or via email to keith.bagot@faa.gov.  Responses should include photographs and information on the vehicle such as application, performance specifications, previous testing/uses, production status, and vehicle cost.   This RFI is for information-gathering purposes only, as provided in the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS).  This is not a solicitation or Screening Information Request (SIR). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Financial reimbursement for use of any equipment will not be provided.  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation.  In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.

<DESC>The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to Port St. Lucie Plaza I, LLC, .  The extension will be for 12,726 rentable square feet of fully serviced office space and 62 surface parking spaces for a term of five (5) months.

The government has a continuing need for this space.  A lease has been awarded for space at a new location and the space will not be ready for occupancy for five months.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interesting in commenting regarding the government's intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov,  or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division, (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida, 33351.  Any written comments are to be received within ten (10) days of the publication of this notice.

Responses are due by the close of business February 15, 2008

The NOAA research ship Okeanos Explorer, requires alternate berthing for crew and officers in Bellingham, Washington from 02/10/08-3/31/08. The ship will be undergoing major interior modifications during a shipyard period at the Fairhaven Shipyard in Bellingham, Washington. 

The ship will be uninhabitable due to the nature of the work being done to the interior spaces. This work is expected to begin daily at 0700 and end at 2400 each day. 

In order to provide accommodations for the employees of the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer during this period the government requires a maximum block of 21 single occupancy rooms for approximately 51 days from 02/10/2008-3/31/08. During this time it is expected that these numbers will change subject to ship requirements and personnel going on leave/training.

Due to training and leave, at any given time crewmen may be vacating their rooms through the usual check out procedure (making those rooms available for other clientele, the Government WILL NOT be charged for these rooms) and checking back into others upon return. Because the vessel has not been fully commissioned (personnel are being hired and assigned at this time) the exact check-in dates are unknown. The ship will determine and convey to the host personnel arrivals as they firm up and in the case of ?No Shows?, the ship will accept accountability.

The following individuals are allowed to speak in behest of the ship and agree to convey to the host timely information as ships personnel arrive and depart.

CDR Joe Pica, First Officer Richard Patana, and, LT. Jeremy Weirich

Transportation will be provided through NOAA MOC Pacific.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
(Posted 1 Feb 08 thru 7 Feb 08)

The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado, intends to award a single source commercial contract to Legacy Communications Inc. Provide Motorola communications equipment and install equipment in a housing unit to support Combat Survival Training (CST). USAFA currently has a new requirement to support CST communications with land mobile radio (LMR) communications equipment. The requirement is to purchase, install and maintain Motorola equipment. Program, install, and optimize the repeaters, install, tune and optimize an antenna combining system, mounting and grounding the antennas, and constructing and properly grounding the transmission lines. All equipment shall be installed in a mobile housing unit. Equipment and time are critical elements. Equipment must be operational, ready for use and delivered not later than 15 May 2008.   

USAFAs current LMR communications equipment is Motorola. Motorola has agreements with companies to be a federal frequency Motorola Service Stations (MSS).  The MSS procure, install and perform all maintenance and warranty work. The MSS are regionalized and can only perform service in their assigned region. With these limitations a federal frequency authorized local MSS is the only one authorized to procure, install and maintain Motorola equipment.  There is currently only one local federal frequency authorized MSS which is Legacy Communication Inc.  

The cost of work associated with equipment responsibility and warranty issues would not be covered using a non federal frequency Motorola Service Station and is not considered of benefit to the government. The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 517210 and the size standard is $1,500.00.

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

<DESC>This is a Brand Name Justification.

Data Domain DD460 provided the best combination of physical foot print, base storage capacity, scalability, data throughput, data compression and cost.  The Data Domain DD460 is the only product that provided all of the following:  

Inline deduplication in a storage appliance - data is not written to disk until after it is deduplicated, or redundant segments removed. This inline approach minimizes number of disk drives needed and supports replication to take place during the backup window for faster off-site protection.

Automatic verification of backups to enable verify feature to be disabled in backup software which will increase backup performance.
                
RAID-6 protection against dual drive failures.
                
Protect current investment of existing backup software.

<DESC>REQUIREMENTS:
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) for a parcel of land.  FEMA is seeking expressions of interest from owners of vacant parcels of land. 

The intended use of the leased land is to provide storage for travel trailers and/or mobile homes which were used by the Louisiana Housing Task Force as temporary emergency housing units (EHU) to those individuals displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.  These EHU will not be occupied.

General Services Administration (GSA) will enter into a lease contract on behalf of FEMA with the owner whose parcel of land is technically acceptable for the intended use of the Government.  FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governmental technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  In making a determination, the GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies? guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the site. 

The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for the intended use by the Government.  Those individuals responding with an expression of interest that meet these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the SFO will be considered for award.

Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA.

1.	Land in one of the following parishes in Louisiana:  East Feliciana, West Feliciana, St. Helena, Tangipahoa, Livingston, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Pointe Coupee, Ascension.  Additionally,  St. Landry, Evangeline, Allen and Beauregard parishes may be considered if the land is located either with direct frontage to Hwy 190 or is located north of 190. 
2.	Parcels of Land no smaller than 175 and no larger than 540 acres.
3.	Land that is flat and hard-surfaced (no loose soil and no crop lands), cleared of    	  	trees, debris and other impediments to support travel trailers and mobile homes.
4. 	Land owner will allow placement of gravel/rock on roadways and lanes on the 	property with possible culvert/piping to make property more accessible and 	conducive to staging travel trailers and mobile homes.
5.	Land that has direct access from primary/secondary paved roads.  Preference is for land with a minimum of 200 feet frontage on these roads with easy access from a major four-lane divided highway and/or interstate highway.  Travel trailers and full size mobile homes (14? x 70?x 13.5?) need to be towed to the site from throughout the state of Louisiana
6.	Land that is has water and electric service to the property is required.
7.	Land that is not wetlands.
8.	Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements, and any other 	necessary approvals for government intended use (parish approval required).
9.	Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical 	regulations.
10.	Occupancy is required by March 1, 2008. 

The expression of interest should include, as a minimum, the following information: 

1.	Owner name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address if 	available.
2.	Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land 	(e.g. copy of deed, mortgage document, or master lease stating the ability to 	sublease for the government?s intended use).
3.	A legal description of the property.
4.	Description of the land:  size (number of acres), physical characteristics, past and 	current use.
5.	Location of the land:  including the municipal (physical) address, city, parish, and 	a small map showing the location and access to the property.
6.	Picture of the site.
7.	If representing an owner, a written agreement with the owner showing authority 	to represent the owner.
8.	Written parish approval for the Government?s intended use.

All expressions of interest shall be addressed as follows and mailed to:
General Services Administration 
Expression of Interest to Vacant Land
3535 S. Sherwood Forest Blvd., Suite 150
Baton Rouge, LA 70816

SOLICITATION PROCESS:
Typically, GSA will solicit offers from all technically acceptable sites.  Site acceptability will be established by the process of determination described above and within the Solicitation for Offer.  The leasing action will be awarded to the lowest price technically acceptable offer.

LEASE TERM:
2 years, 1- year firm term. 

RENTAL RATE:
An annual rate of return on the estimated value of the selected site is offered as a lease rental payment.  The Government will not accept an increased value assessment or an excessive interest rate due to the nature of this requirement.  The intent of the Government is not to operate a commercial business on the property and, therefore, there is no income for consideration in determining a fair rental rate.


RIGHT-OF-ENTRY FORM:
The owner will be required to provide access and entry onto the property to FEMA and its representatives for the purpose of performance of environmental and other assessment to determine technical feasibility for intended use.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and exercise Option 1 of contract N00019-07-C-0052 with Switlik Parachute Co., Inc, Trenton, NJ to procure an accelerated quantity of floatation assemblies. It is the intent to procure an additional 7,906 units under this first option for a total of 8,906 units as a result of a requirement from the United States Marine Corps to accelerate the Helicopter Egress System for Passengers (HESP) program. HESP is the Phase II upgrade to the Interim Passenger Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device (IPHABD). HESP consists of an underwater breathing device and a flotation system. HESP provides longer breathing time and improved buoyancy for Marine Corps passengers in Naval Aircraft. HESP replaced the Navy?s Helicopter Aircrew breathing Device (HABD) with an improved and common bottle. As the sole source designer and manufacturer for the HESP flotation assembly, Switlik is the only company that has the ability, resources and technology necessary to produce the additional numbers required due to the time sensitivity of this procurement. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The estimated period of performance is eight months beginning after contract award. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is N61331-08-T-1740.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price contract to Lenovo (United States) Inc., One Manhattanville Road, Suite P, Purchase, NY 10577-2100.  This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC-PCD) Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) Acquisition Engineering Agency (AEA) has been designated responsible for system engineering, design, develo!  pment, integration, testing, production, and delivery of the DJC2 Increment I system.  This responsibility includes the development of training materials, system documentation, system testing, maintenance and inventory.  The DJC2 program is a DOD-designated ?fast track? program.  The fast track program is a DOD experiment in how rapidly evolving technologies can be developed and fielded to the warfighter.  Therefore, the program schedules for the design, integration and delivery of this system were made without the traditional acquisition program?s normal lifespan.  To date, DJC2 has fielded systems to JFCOM, SOUTHCOM, EUCOM, USAFE, and PACOM, and also produced systems for NSWC-PC designated for in house integration and development efforts.  This equipment is the next generation of the production representative hardware architecture that has already been designed and fielded.  This is the eighth delivery of a standardized, configuration-managed system.  The DJC2 Acquisition!   Strategy defines this approach during this increment of the system, i n order to maximize the potential for product improvements on current part numbers from the rapidly evolving world of information technology.  The AEA is not allowed to compete this server and storage purchases (and associated LENOVO-branded items as applicable) to other common hardware manufacturers.  The DJC2 program as already invested considerable cost and time in integration and system testing.   Using a different vendor?s hardware would force a new integration and testing cycle of the overall system at considerable cost.  Commonality and compatibility with existing DJC2 equipment will decrease the training requirements and will eliminate the need for a completely separate logistics tail for these systems.  Source control drawings, training materials and other support products have already been developed at government expense for this vendors hardware and the majority of these products will be able to be re-used. The following is being procured: CLIN 0001:  140 each part number 7663CD2 Laptop Computers CLIN 0002:  560 each part number 41N5662 Thinkpad Hard Drives CLIN 0003:  560 each part number 40Y8725 Thinkpad Hard Drive Bay Adapters CLIN 0004:  140 each part number 06P4069 Thinkplus USB Optical Wheel Mouse CLIN 0005:  140 each part number 41N3004 Gemplus GemPC smart card readers NAICS CODE IS 334111.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is N61331-08-T-1741.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price contract to Environmental Container Systems, Inc., dba ECS Composites, 3560 Rogue River Highway, Grants Pass, Oregon 97527-4640.  This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  Use of the listed ECS Composites products fulfills the following requirements:  ECS Composites is the provider of custom made equipment transit cases for DJC2.  These transit cas!  es are essential components of the DJC2 infrastructure support suite.

Also, most ECS Composites transit cases have been custom designed for specific pieces of equipment in the DJC2 system.  As it stands, ECS Composites provide the majority of the transit cases for DJC2 equipment.  In an effort to minimize the impacts to configuration management and procurement lead time, ECS Composites should be the chosen vendors for the infrastructure support equipment listed in the table.  Successf!  ul demonstration of product and service competency has been shown duri ng the previous individual system purchases.  Due to the rapid procurement and fielding requirements of the DJC2 Joint Program Office, this is deemed the most expedient and cost-effective method available for the short acquisition window.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is N61331-08-T-1742.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price contract to PowerSystems International, Inc., 860 Douglas Way, Natural Bridge Station, VA 24579.  This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The DJC2 program is an accelerated acquisition DoD program. The accelerated acquisition program is a DoD experiment in how fast rapidly evolving technologies can be developed and fielded to the warfighter.  Thu!  s said, schedules for the integration and delivery of this system were made without the traditional acquisition program's normal lifespan. DJC2 progressed from inception to Milestone "C" to the build of systems in support of its initial operational capability (IOC), over the short span of approximately eighteen months.  These listed products provide the necessary environment for control and protection of mission-critical command and control electronics in this deployable system.  These items currently fit within a specific location in the load plan, and are tested and fielded parts of the system.  While there are other hardware components that would fulfill the form, fit, and functionality of these items, these items are currently an approved part of the system configuration.  As it stands, PSI provides a significant portion of the critical infrastructure support equipment that has been fielded with the first DJC2 systems.  To eliminate the major impacts to configuration ma!  nagement, training, and logistics support, and the associated cost imp act, that would occur from selection of any other vendor, PSI is identified as the only vendor for the infrastructure support equipment listed in the table.  Successful demonstration of these products and service competency has been shown during the previous individual system purchases.  Due to the rapid procurement and fielding requirements of the DJC2 Joint Program Office, this is deemed the most expedient and cost-effective method available for the short acquisition window.  Purchase of this hardware from PSI is deemed essential due to the program's rapid timeline. Items purchase for this requisition will be used for production and fielding of a warfighter deliverable in accordance with the required delivery date of the requisition. The following is being procured: CLIN 0001:  P/N 2003727, Kit 60KW DEG Rework (Digital Conversion), 7 EA.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is N61331-08-T-1743.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price contract to PowerSystems International, Inc., 860 Douglas Way, Natural Bridge Station, VA 24579.  This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The DJC2 program is an accelerated acquisition DoD program. The accelerated acquisition program is a DoD experiment in how fast rapidly evolving technologies can be developed and fielded to the warfighter.  Thu!  s said, schedules for the integration and delivery of this system were made without the traditional acquisition program's normal lifespan. DJC2 progressed from inception to Milestone "C" to the build of systems in support of its initial operational capability (IOC), over the short span of approximately eighteen months.  These listed products provide the necessary environment for control and protection of mission-critical command and control electronics in this deployable system.  These items currently fit within a specific location in the load plan, and are tested and fielded parts of the system.  While there are other hardware components that would fulfill the form, fit, and functionality of these items, these items are currently an approved part of the system configuration.  As it stands, PSI provides a significant portion of the critical infrastructure support equipment that has been fielded with the first DJC2 systems.  To eliminate the major impacts to configuration ma!  nagement, training, and logistics support, and the associated cost imp act, that would occur from selection of any other vendor, PSI is identified as the only vendor for the infrastructure support equipment listed in the table.  Successful demonstration of these products and service competency has been shown during the previous individual system purchases.  Due to the rapid procurement and fielding requirements of the DJC2 Joint Program Office, this is deemed the most expedient and cost-effective method available for the short acquisition window.  Purchase of this hardware from PSI is deemed essential due to the program's rapid timeline. Items purchase for this requisition will be used for production and fielding of a warfighter deliverable in accordance with the required delivery date of the requisition. The following is being procured: CLIN 0001:  P/N 1000100, Support Trailer Tongue, 15 EA CLIN 0002:  P/N 2000326, Cable Assembly Battery Charger, 3 EA CLIN 0003:  P/N 2001043, Wheel Tongue Mounted, 15 EA CLIN 0004:  P/N 2001592, PDU 2-200A Inlets 6-60A Outlets, 8 EA CLIN 0005:  P/N 2001593, Cable 200A 5W 50FT PWR Distribution, 9 EA CLIN 0006:  P/N 2001594, Trlr Sys Dual 8T 160 LG, 6 EA CLIN 0007:  P/N 2001789, Transition ECU Return 18 DIA., 12 EA CLIN 0008:  P/N 2001792, Transition ECU Supply 18 DIA., 3 EA CLIN 0009:  P/N 2001853, Tie Down Assembly (2 X 144 & 1 X 192), 6 EA CLIN 0010:  P/N 2001854, Transition ECU Supply (2) X 12 DIA., 6 EA CLIN 0011:  P/N 2002025, Cable 60A 5W 250FT PWR Distribution, 27 EA CLIN 0012:  P/N 2002387, UDB 60A Feed-Thru (3) 20A GFI W/MTRS, 57 EA CLIN 0013:  P/N 2003705, UDB 60A Feed-Thru (2)20A GF (1)30A W/MTRS, 10 EA CLIN 0014:  P/N 2003723, Cable Assembly Ethernet, 3 EA CLIN 0015:  P/N 2003728, TRLR SYS 60K 208V 160" DIGITAL w/SP GRN, 9 EA CLIN 0016:  P/N 2003941, Inteligen Signal Interface Box For 5 DEG, 3 EA.

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED (ELECTRONICALLY/NO HARD COPY WILL BE ISSUED) on or about February 15, 2008 (subject to change).  This acquisition will be full and open competition. The award will be based upon the best value to the government considering tradeoffs between price and non-price related factors.  An example of the non-price evaluation factors is as follow, however; potential offerors will need to refer to the solicitation (when issued) for the selection criteria/factors to be evaluated by the government since they are subject to change. A) EXPERIENCE - PROJECTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE, MAGNITUDE AND SCOPE; LOCATED IN AN EXTREME ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT WITH VERY LIMITED ACCESS; B) PAST PERFORMANCE - IN RELATION TO THE EXPERIENCE/PROJECTS SUBMITTED; AND C) CAPACITY - ABILITY TO PERFORM THIS PROJECT RELATIVE TO OTHER WORK.  The NAICS Code is 237110 and size standard is $31M.  The estimated range of this project is $1,000,000 - $5,000,000.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with the potential contractors.  This project is subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price. Funds are available for the proposed action, however, if the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.  Responders are advised that the requirement(s) may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation, and/or final award process based on decisions related to DOI and NPS changes. Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) government system prior to award to be eligible for a government contract - the link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete and in-place should they be selected for the award. In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the contracting officer is ready to award the contract, the contracting officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered in the CCR database.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, intends to resolicit a current contract with the Regents of the University of California to continue the study of disease and disability onset in an old age cohort established in the Health ABC Study.  This is a unique scientific opportunity to take advantage of an established epidemiologic cohort on which extensive data has been obtained.  This opportunity also takes advantage of the research study management infrastructure, such as specialized data entry, quality control, and data management systems developed to support the data collected in the study, already developed in the existing Health ABC Coordinating Center contract (N01-AG-6-2106) with University of California, San Francisco.  The key elements of this project include:  twice yearly phone interviews of functional and cognitive status performed with the same telephone instrument used in the ten years of the study; continued ascertainment of disease and disability endpoints and continued adjudication of cause-of-death; and maintenance of the biorepository.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 2539(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition makes competition unfeasible for this resolicitation.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh PA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Sapko Consulting Services for a Base Effort and Optional Effort.  Tasks to be preformed under base effort are:
1)	Analyze NIOSH Lake Lynn Lab (LLL) Experimental Mine?s explosion data to assess impacts of coal mine dust particle sizing on inerting requirements.
2)	Participate in technical discussion regarding the development and assessment of calibration requirements for the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM).
3)	Analyze LLL explosion data with particular emphasis on the sourcing effects of such explosions.  Provide technical assistance correlating the dust-scouring actions of the explosions to the relevance of the existing MSHA ?one-inch depth? sampling requirements.
Tasks to be performed under the option, if exercised are as follows:
4)	Co-author a peer-reviewed article on the results from Task 3 with regards to MSHA?s ?one-inch depth? requirement.
5)	Assist DPRB personnel with development of technique or tool for collecting appropriate rock dust samples with sample depths less than one inch.
6)	New Seals Project ? to develop simple CFD models of methane accumulation, air leakage and inertization of sealed areas using the NIST FDS program.
7)	Assist with experimental design and testing of large gas explosions; practical techniques to shield seals from high pressure explosion transients and instrumentation package design and mine implementation, measurement of methane accumulation and sealed area atmosphere composition.

Mike Sapko, principal of Sapko Consulting LLC, is a internationally recognized authority in the area of hazards of fire, explosions and explosive safety and instrumentation to improve coal mine health and safety.  His research work on laboratory and large-scale dust and gas explosions provides the background to provide meaningful input concerning inerting levels for coal mine dusts and to identify operational issues associated with measuring such levels.  He also has considerable experience in developing alternative test methods for evaluating mine seals.  This, coupled with prior work with the measurement and behavior of explosive atmospheres, contributes to considering him a valuable asset for understanding the risks of maintaining such an atmosphere in a sealed area.  

The generalized knowledge of the issues surrounding dust and gas explosions, the specific experience of Sapko Consulting Services with NIOSH full-scale test facilities will improve the interpretation of data obtained from such facilities and will eliminate the need to educate an individual on the specifics of the facilities? operations.  This experience will be critical to the successful and timely completion of these tasks. 

This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Sapko Consulting Services, under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).  Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to James Ambrozic, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCB1-2008-52147, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Acquistion and Assistance Field Branch (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract.  The website is:  www.ccr.gov.

The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement.  Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Sapko Consulting Services, 106 Barr Road, Finleyville, PA 15332, as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The intent of this effort is to demonstrate technologies for real-time, on the move capacity for detection a nd identification of anomalies and pre-defined targets including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), humans, or other targets of interest which may be concealed, camouflaged, practicing spoofing/deception or otherwise hidden. The envisioned technologies m ust use covert sensor modalities which shall allow it to operate in day or night in unknown illumination conditions without the use of external calibration targets (i.e. through the use of the data itself to perform the spectral unmixing.)  Of special inte rest are combinations of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and Broadband EO/IR sensors, which have been shown to complement each other. This BAA is issued pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 6.102 (d)(2) and 35.016 in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR ) which provides for competitive selections of basic research proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA which are selected for award will be considered the result of Full and Open Competition and are in full compliance with PL 98-369, The Com petition in Contracting Act of 1984.

<DESC>02/01/2008  Questions and answers are attached. SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at  this time.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research  purposes only.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential  sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Air Force SBIR  contractors with technical assistance in accordance with USC Title 15,  Sec. 638 Paragraph q, Discretionary Technical Assistance.  The primary  focus of this assistance is intended to be in the area of planning and  preparation for commercialization of technologies, products, or services  developed under Air Force SBIR contracts.  Technical assistance provided  under this effort is not intended to focus on solving specific technical  problems that arise in the course of technology development under a  particular SBIR contract.  A proposed draft Performance Work Statement  (PWS) is attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the  needs of the AF SBIR Program and the respondent?s potential ability to  meet the Government?s requirement. The Government envisions a one year award with two subsequent 12 month  renewal options.  In the first year, assistance efforts will be limited to  Phase I SBIR recipients only, in accordance with the tasks described in  the draft PWS, Sec. 1.1. The total value of the first year effort is  expected to be limited to not more than $2M.  In the second and third  year, support efforts are expected to expand to include assistance to  Phase II SBIR recipients.  Additional tasks are described in Sec. 1.2 of  the daft PWS.  At present, the total value of the second and third year  efforts are expected to be limited to not more than $4M a year, however;  anticipated changes in the governing law may allow for a value of as high  as $6.5M a year.  Firms responding are expected to show the ability to  develop a flexible plan to provide increased levels of assistance if  additional funding is available in the second and third year. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, small disadvantaged business,  woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business or service disabled  veteran-owned small business, and should also indicate if the firm is  foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712  applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 1500 employees. The AF is requesting that respondents propose a Federal Supply Schedule,  in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.4 for this  requirement.  Respondents must propose the schedule that they feel is  appropriate for this acquisition.  The AF anticipates that the task order  will be for 1 year with 2 option years. All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly  demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort.  Foreign  contractor participation is not permitted. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this  synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated  with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  This synopsis  does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal  (RFP), or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the  Government?s acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to  reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this  announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a  part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary  data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary  information.  If the Government decides to award a contract for this or  related effort, a combined synopsis/solicitation will be published. DATE DUE:  Packages must be received in the buying office not later than  12:00 EST, 06 Feb 2008.  All questions shall be submitted in writing to  toni.waggoner@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, intends to resolicit a current contract with the Regents of the University of California to continue the study of disease and disability onset in an old age cohort established in the Health ABC Study.  This is a unique scientific opportunity to take advantage of an established epidemiologic cohort on which extensive data has been obtained.  This opportunity also takes advantage of the research study management infrastructure, such as specialized data entry, quality control, and data management systems developed to support the data collected in the study, already developed in the existing Health ABC Coordinating Center contract (N01-AG-6-2106) with University of California, San Francisco.  The key elements of this project include:  twice yearly phone interviews of functional and cognitive status performed with the same telephone instrument used in the ten years of the study; continued ascertainment of disease and disability endpoints and continued adjudication of cause-of-death; and maintenance of the biorepository.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 2539(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition makes competition unfeasible for this resolicitation.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) intends to obtain Microsoft Technology Strategy Services (MTSS), Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) and Microsoft Premier Support Services (MPSS) from Microsoft Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and all of its components, for a DHS-wide Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The contract will have a base period of three months and 3 three-month option periods with task orders issued against the contract. This contract supports the DHS mission, is in compliance with and under the direction of DHS, federal and executive mandates, national security, as well as emergency response.  

CBP's Office of Information and Technology (OIT) is responsible for the implementation and support of information technology (IT), research and development functions, and automation and technological strategies for meeting mission related needs. Specifically, OIT is responsible for automated information systems, management of the research and development functions and all forensic and laboratory support of the agency. OIT manage all computer and related resources including all operational aspects of the Computer Security Program; establish requirements for computer interfaces between CBP and various trade groups and Government agencies; and manage matters related to automated import processing and systems development. OIT focuses on integrating business and technical solutions across the OIT enterprise with an emphasis on a collaborative approach.

The objective is to provide access to Microsoft Services in support of DHS' effort in planning, implementing, deploying, using, and maintaining its Microsoft software, solutions and technologies. Access includes DHS' ability to establish unique and singularly distinct access to Microsoft's product divisions that is necessary to support and maintain CBP's far-reaching mission. Microsoft Services' infrastructure and developer expertise will be engaged to implement solutions and provide knowledge transfer to the Government and support the Government in the validation and measurement of its system integrators' involvement of Microsoft technologies in the areas of collaboration, security, connected systems, operational efficiency and deployments.

Microsoft personnel have access to proprietary information exclusively available within Microsoft such as internal product support knowledge bases and proprietary architectural and technical information not available to the public or third party (Microsoft Certified Software Engineers- MCSEs). Additionally, Microsoft personnel have access to internal development teams within Microsoft who wrote the code behind Microsoft's application. This is not only essential, but the only way to resolve complex programming and support issues efficiently. Given the state of the art technology and ability to obtain high level information available to solely Microsoft employees, Microsoft is determined to be essential to DHS' ability to quickly develop and deploy applications that have a high degree of reliability.

Microsoft is the only company that could provide an advanced escalation service that would support changes to the code-base within Microsoft's proprietary product offerings in order to respond to a Critical IT event, emergency, or for national security, within a 36 to 72 hour timeframe and resolve Critical IT Events within DHS' major IT investments in order to achieve our objectives and overall success.

The Government has determined that Microsoft Corporation is uniquely qualified to perform the services and has been selected to receive a contract award. Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any responses shall be submitted electronically to isabelle.nguyen@dhs.gov. Responses shall be submitted no later than 12:00PM EST February 7, 2008. Responses shall include the vendor's experience, expertise, capabilities, and personnel with respect to the services described herein and address the vendor's access to Microsoft's proprietary information, access to Microsoft's internal development teams, Microsoft's internal product support knowledge bases, Microsoft's proprietary architectural and technical information.

The rentable area must yield between 6, 197 and 6,479 ANSI BOMA office area square feet.  The space will be occupied by the Census Bureau for operations associated with the 2010 Census enumeration.

The following space configurations will not be considered: space split by a public corridor; space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space; extremely long or narrow runs of space; irregularly shaped space configurations or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Space shall be located in a commercially zoned area and shall not be located near railroad tracks or other land uses that negatively impact normal business operations.  Space shall not be located within a flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  Space should not be 1) located in a building housing federal, state, or local law enforcement, tax authorities, courts and associated court-related services,  immigration services, or social service agencies; 2) located in a building housing a US Department of Homeland Security agency; or 3)  located in a building housing drug treatment or prisoner detention. The agency shall have access to its space 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. The Government requires a fully serviced lease including the provision of possible overtime utility service with the number of hours established  by the Government that will be payable outside of the rent. The Government requires a loading dock (or acceptable alternative such as a scissor lift) and adequate maneuvering room for ongoing truck deliveries.  The Government requires a total of three (3) parking spaces in close proximity of the space for employees included as part of the lease.  In addition, there must be at least fifty (50) parking spaces available for free, fee or lease within three (3) blocks of the building with handicap parking availability.  Parking spaces in commercial lots shall be available throughout the day, and be within commercial rates.   The space must be located within three (3) blocks of public transportation and a variety of dining establishments.

The Government will consider quotes only from ?authorized resellers? of Tektronix, Inc.  The contractor must bid on ALL items and must be quoted FOB Destination.  This will be a brand name only procurement, all equipment and assoicated parts must be as requested items.  Substitutes will not be accepted based on the attached Brand Name Justification.

The Government will issue an order to the responsible quoter, with acceptable past performance, submitting the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation.  This order will include the following referenced clauses which may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov:
	FAR 52.204-9 (Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (JAN 2006)
	FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items) (OCT 2003)
	FAR 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items) (JUL 2005)
	FAR 52.219-8 (Utilization of Small Business Concerns and Small Disadvantage Business Concerns) (MAY 2004)
	FAR 52.232-33 (Payment by Electronic Funds-Central Contractor Registration) (OCT 2003)
	DFARS 252.204-7004, Alt A (Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (NOV 2003)
	DFARS 252.232-7003 (Electronic Submission of Payment Request) (JAN 2004)
	DFARS 252.246-7000 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report) (MAR 2003)

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information)(DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included. 


Invoicing Instructions:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an ?Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)? be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? or the ?Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)? option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the ?Invoice? option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC>Description:

Sources Sought Notices (herein referred to as a Request for Information) are issued by Department of State (DoS) in performing market research to determine industry interest and capabilities. This is a Request for Information announcement only. This is not a solicitation or request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission of this Request for Information nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.

The DoS reserves the right to terminate this request and change its requirements if needed. Responding to this notice does not guarantee participation in future Department activities. 

Background:

The Department is seeking sources capable of providing program engineering, production control and delivery to its Global Information Technology Modernization (GITM) Program under the General Services Administration (GSA) IT 70 Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) or other. The DoS Bureau of Information Resources Management (IRM) Program Management and Analysis (PMA) Directorate has had a full history of modernizing technology.  Originally, the Directorate was tasked with implementing the - A Logistical Modernization Approach - (ALMA) Program, focusing its resources solely on refreshing and modernizing overseas unclassified technology.  The ALMA Program was followed by a similar effort domestically to encourage Department bureaus to modernize equipment and systems. As part of this effort, OpenNetPlus was initiated in 2001 to provide all unclassified users access to e-mail and the Internet.

In 2001, PMA initiated the Classified Connectivity Program (CCP), acting on the Departments desire to quickly replace the obsolete computer/communications equipment that posts were using to process classified foreign affairs information and to extend capabilities to posts that did not formerly have access to classified processing and classified e-mail.  This program was completed in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 and extended both classified processing capabilities and e-mail to 221 posts.

In October 2003, ALMA and CCP were combined to establish the GITM Program.  The GITM Program provides strong customer focus and services closely aligned with the Departments E-Government (E-Gov) and E-Diplomacy guidance and vision to missions abroad and domestic bureaus/offices.  The GITM modernization of classified and unclassified systems protects the Departments substantial investment in IT infrastructure by keeping the Local Area Network (LAN) segment of the Department?s networks on a four (4) year refresh cycle.  GITMs program attributes include centralized management of the IT infrastructure under a single Program Management Office (PMO), facilitation and infrastructure changes required to support the Departments evolving reengineered business processes, and modernization of the IT infrastructure that results in an enhancement of the enterprises overall security.  These attributes promote increased operational efficiencies and cost avoidance across the Department, as well as a strengthened security posture for systems.

GITM intends to support the Presidents Management Agenda initiative of Expanded Electronic Government by employing common information technology that facilitates seamless information sharing across agencies.  GITM also supports the Departments efforts for IT Consolidation, and the Departments Strategic Architecture and Strategic Plan. Utilizing a four-year refresh cycle, each funded mission domestic and abroad is visited by GITM and receives modernized information technology equipment.  This lifecycle is successfully accomplished through the use of and adherence to well-defined processes and procedures.

PMA is an International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001 certified organization.

ManTech International Corporation, Fairfax, VA is the incumbent contractor.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), National Logistics Support Center (NLSC) located in Kansas City, MO intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for the purchase of forty (40) load cell assembly, FPU, with load cell PCB, Block, Post (Anvil), cell, Ball,  4 long machine screws with washers, lockwashers, Fischer & Porter upgrade (FPU) Electronic weighing precipitation gage, NSN:  NWS0-51-040-0008, ASN:  D111C-1A1,  on a sole source basis from Coastal Environmental Systems, Inc. based on the following: 1) The Fischer & Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage was originally manufactured in the early 1980?s for NWS.  The F&P consists of two main parts, a rain collecting pan that will hold a total of about 19.5 inches of rain and an automatic, yet intricate and delicate, weighing and recording mechanism.  Every 15 minutes, a timer activates the recording mechanism and holes are punched into a paper tape (or strip chart) indicating the cumulative amount of collected rainfall to the nearest tenth of an inch using a weight to depth conversion factor.  The paper tape is divided into frames; each individual frame is divided into 24 hour segments.  At the beginning of each month, an observer is tasked with removing the tape and sending it to the local NWS office.  There, it is examined and forwarded to the National Climatic Data Center for archiving and publication as official Hourly Precipitation Data.  2) The F&P (ASN:  D111) is a legacy system in dire need of an upgrade.  This upgrade comes in the form of the F&P Upgrade (FPU), in which the existing punch mechanism is replaced with a digital data recording system that collects, represents, and disseminates precipitation data to the same level of quality as the mechanical paper tape; 3) Both types of gauges will continue to be operated by NWS COOP Observers.  The Gauge Modification Assembly (GMA) Load Cell Assembly (D111C-1A1) is installed inside the skeleton of the legacy F&P gauge.  All hardware that interfaces to the modified gauge is custom designed and mounted to existing threaded holes.  This equipment modification is tested and qualified at significant Government expense to only change the way the precipitation measurement is taken and not in the quality or the timeliness of the station?s hourly precipitation data; 4) NWS does not maintain the design drawings or specification for the individual FPU components.  Coastal Environmental Systems Inc. is currently the only known responsible source for the individual upgraded gauge components as it is the owner of the original design drawings, specifications and tooling; 5) Because of the exacting mechanical precision of load cell and of the interacting components, unqualified reproductions will not provide the required fit, function, accuracy, resolution of the correct interface to the F&P Gauge or the FPU Zeno data logger.
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required Transmission Test Sets.  The applicable NAICS code is 334519.

DOC, CRAD requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR.     For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), National Logistics Support Center (NLSC) located in Kansas City, MO intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for the purchase of ten (10) test sets, transmission line, Ameritec Part Number AM-48XT with model 870016 padded carrying case, NSN:  6625-01-304-4945, ASN:  T335,  on a sole source basis from Ameritec Corporation, Covina, CA based on the following: 1) The Ameritec AM-48 Transmission Line Test Set is used to maintain the WSR-88D weather surveillance radars commonly known as NEXRAD.  NEXRAD is a joint program involving the Department of Commerce (National Weather Service), the Department of Defense, and the Department of transportation (Federal Aviation Administration);  2) The AM-48 is also used for maintenance and troubleshooting in the NOAA Weather Radio program; 3)  In order to gain the most benefit from the shared resources of the three agencies, like support equipment must be used at all sites; 4)  To date a minimum of 120 of the Transmission Line Test Sets have already been purchased and issued to NWS, Department of Defense (DOD), and FAA NEXRAD sites; 5) The equipment specified is used at NWS primary operational and technical support facility located in Norman, OK.  Its technical assistance hotline must be able to coach technicians through troubleshooting activities using a standard frame of reference; 6) This equipment is described in the published NEXRAD and NOAA Weather Radio maintenance procedures.  Alteration of those procedures to accommodate equipment substitutions would be costly and manpower intensive in that the manual would have to be rewritten with additional test procedures and redistributed to 120 NWS NEXRAD sites.  The Radar Operations Center (also responsible for manuals) requires that manuals with the same procedures are distributed to all NEXRAD sites (NWS, DOD, FAA); 7) This equipment is used at the NWS Training Center to train maintenance personnel.  Additional course material and classroom time would be necessary to train using other vendors equipment; 8) There is no other known vendor that can meet the specified requirements for the Transmission Test Sets; 9) Non standardized equipment is more expensive to support in the Consolidated Logistics Supply System due to the costs to catalog, stock, maintain, and supply multiple items of the same type.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Smoking Machine
<DESC>This is not a solicitation and thus quotes are neither requested nor required.  This is a special notice of intent.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) requires a 20-port Rotary smoking machine to conduct analyses of toxic and carcinogenic metals in tobacco smoke.  The smoking machine must have an integrated electrostatic precipitator and quartz collection tubes that are required for testing metals in particulate. Additionally, the smoking machine must  have an electrostatic smoke trap with tungsten tip and quartz collection tubes for trapping metals-containing smoke particulate; this requirement is the single most important integrated component.  The smoke trap is essential for adding elements to our analyses for toxic and carcinogenic metals in tobacco smoke.  In addition to the trapping capability and less contaminating nature of the tungsten probe, the quartz tubes permit extraction of tar with lower metals background than glass.

CDC intends to purchase a RM20H Rotary smoking machine with Electrostatic Precipitator, Tungsten Probes, Quartz Tubes, Accessories for Hoffmann Analytes from Borgwaldt KC, Inc., Richmond, VA which is the only known, responsible source capable of satisfying the minimum requirements.  No other source offers a 20-port rotary smoking machine that  has an integrated electrostatic precipitator and quartz collection tubes that are required for testing metals in particulate and a smoke trap with tungsten tip and quartz collection tubes for trapping metals-containing smoke particulate.

The statutory authority for this intended sole source procurement action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 10, 2008.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.

DCHA/OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability. When a crisis occurs in a priority country, DCHA/OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis. 

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. The typical OTI country strategy follows US Government policy and directly involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change - wherever and whenever possible.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

Currently, the program is attempting to strengthen independent civil society actors who are working to protect the basic rights and expand democratic space that still exist in Venezuela. The project currently has five partner organizations: Development Alternatives, Inc.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ100790 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-23.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 423450.   BACKGROUND The National Institutes of Health, CRC, currently has a medication management system.  This system has been in place since FY97.  A medication management system is used to manage controlled substances and floor stock on the nursing units and in the pharmacy department.  The system provides secure storage throughout the hospital and clinics and communicates with a central console located in the pharmacy.  This med management system increases efficiency by eliminating narcotic key searches, end of shift counts and stock outs.  The system frees up nursing time for more direct patient care and greatly enhances controlled substance accountability and control through ongoing monitoring of drug usage patterns, providing fewer opportunities for medication error, and allowing access only to medications for which orders are written.  All users of our med management system must be given system training and issued a password.  Over the years, we have upgraded our current system and plan to upgrade in the future.  These upgrades further increase the efficiency of the system and provide greater patient safety features.  Many of these upgrades will be tied to upgrades in our current hospital CRIS.

I. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
The purpose of this Request for Quote (RFQ) is to solicit sealed bids from qualified firms to establish a contract(s) for the furnishing, installation, start-up calibration, and testing of a Medication Management System for the National Institutes of Health Clinical Research Center (NIHCRC).  The NIHCRC is currently using Pyxis 2000 version for our medication management system.  The current contract will expire 4/12/2008. 
NIHCRC reserves the right to solicit service contract bids from qualified
independent service organizations in the interest of reducing its technical support costs. This decision of award will be at the sole discretion of NIHCRC and such decisions will be based on NIHCRC?s sole opinion about which firm(s) best meets the needs and requirements of NIHCRC and is the best value to the US government.

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [  ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

All responsible business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is 14 February, 2008 ? 1:00PM local time.

<DESC>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program Office (HPCMP) is sponsoring a Performance Modeling and Prediction Workshop, to be held on 21-22 February 2008, in Lorton, VA.  This workshop is to familiarize the HPC vendor community with the performance modeling methodology that is being considered for use in analysis and performance predictions in the upcoming TI-09 HPC procurement activity and to provide feedback to TI-08 HPC vendors on performance predictions for their systems.  The workshop is constructed as a half-day general session on the morning of 21 February that will consist of a review of the performance prediction methodology and its potential uses in TI-09 evaluation, followed by individual sessions on the afternoon of 21 February and the morning of 22 February with TI-08 vendors and vendors interested in TI-09 to present individual TI-08 performance prediction data to vendors and further discuss the proposed TI-09 methodology.

It is important that each HPC offeror that is interested in submitting a TI-09 proposal participate in the workshop, including the offeror's technical staff involved in benchmarking and performance modeling; this workshop will present a technical approach to performance modeling and provide offerors an opportunity to provide technical feedback on this approach.  Note that eligible TI-09 offerors must be original equipment manufacturers who:  (1) have offerings obtainable via existing GSA Contracts under Schedule 70 ?General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, Services?; (2)  have demonstrated success in large scale manufacturing, delivery and acceptance of commercially available, production HPC systems; and (3) have clearances allowing access to sensitive DoD technology and facilities.  Potential offerors meeting the above criteria that are interested in attending the Performance Modeling and Prediction Workshop should contact Mrs. Deborah E. Joeckel, General Services Administration, no later than 8 February 2008.  Please send an email to deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov, and provide the name of your company, a primary POC with email and phone number, and names of those targeted to attend.  Each potential offeror should plan to send no more than three persons from their company.  Participation in this workshop does not require a security clearance.  A separate FedBiz announcement initiating the TI-09 acquisition will be published on or about 18 February 2008.  The TI-09 Phase I RFQ will be released to pre-qualified offerors on or about 21 April 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR>Backing Compound for Poe Lock Miter Blocks<BR><BR>Part 1	GENERAL<BR><BR>1.1	Description of Need<BR><BR>The Poe Lock at the Soo Area Office has three sets of miter gates that hold back t he water pressure generated by a 21 drop in water level from the upstream side of the lock to the downstream side. In order to achieve a proper seal between the gates, a set of steel miter contact blocks are used. Each gate leaf has a block extending the entire height of the gate on the edge that contacts the opposite gate leaf. Due to varying tolerances in the width of each gate leaf, these blocks must be adjusted accordingly. Adjustment comes in the form of jacking screws which hold the blocks up to 1 f rom the edge of the gate. After adjustments are made, this gap must be filled with a material to provide a leak proof barrier. Molten zinc was poured through 1 pour holes in the back side of the 60 high gate leaf to provide this barrier. <BR><BR>Due to t he hazards imposed by the use of molten zinc, a better alternative was sought. Through research of products currently on the market, it was determined that a non-shrinking backing compound would be a suitable replacement for the zinc. However, the products  researched all appeared to have a certain bonding strength to the materials that surround them. This being the case, a brushable release agent will also be required so that the backing compound does not bond with the surrounding steel surfaces. In additio n, there are gaps around the sides and bottom of the miter blocks. These gaps must be filled with some sort of packing to prevent the uncured compound from flowing out.<BR><BR><BR>Part 2	PRODUCTS & SERVICES<BR><BR>2.1 	Materials<BR><BR>2.1.1	Backing Compou nd<BR><BR>The contractor shall supply enough compound to fill 16,800 cu. in. The compound must be supplied in containers that allow approximately 1,400 cu. in. pours to be prepared at one time. A specification sheet for the compound shall be submitted as p art of the quote. The compound shall meet the following specifications:<BR><BR>a.	Pour viscosity no greater than 25,000 Cp at 35?F.<BR>b.	Capable of curing to full mechanical properties within 5 days at 35?F.<BR>c.	Working life no less than 20 minutes at 6 0?F.<BR>d.	Capable of 1,400 cu. in. pours.<BR>e.	Linear shrinkage no more than 0.0005 in./in.<BR>f.	Pours will be in increments such that the filled void dimensions are: 10-1/8 wide X 1 deep X 120 high. After 5 hours curing at 35?F, the first pour must be capable of supporting a second pour above it.<BR>g.	Water absorption must be less than 0.5%.<BR>h.	Retention of physical properties at low temperatures down to -40?F.<BR>i.	Compressive strength no less than 16,000 psi.<BR>j.	Area occupancy within 4 hour s of pour without respirators.<BR><BR>2.1.2	Release Agent<BR><BR>The contractor shall supply enough release agent to cover 36,000 sq. in. The release agent shall provide sufficient protection of steel surfaces by not allowing backing compound to bond to th ese surfaces. The release agent must able to be applied with a brush. It must also be capable of being applied to a vertical surface. The release agent must have a working life of no less than 7 days from date of application.<BR><BR>2.1.3	Packing Material< BR><BR>The contractor shall supply 1,000 cu. in. packing material to seal gaps between gate and miter blocks. These gaps will range in size from 1/16 to 1 wide. Packing material shall supply sufficient bonding strength to steel surfaces in order to hold the pressure of uncured backing compound with minimal leakage. <BR><BR>2.2	Technical Support<BR><BR>The contractor shall make available a technical representati ve for technical support during the pouring process. One trip shall be required to the Soo Area Office in Sault Ste. Marie, MI for a maximum of 5 days. The contractor will have 7 days advance notice of the need for a technical representative to be onsite. The tentative schedule for pouring would be from late February 2008 to mid March 2008.<BR><BR>Part 3	DELIVERY<BR><BR>3.1	Delivery<BR><BR>The backing compound, release agent, and packing material shall be delivered to the Soo Area Office, 119 Water St., Sau lt Ste. Marie, Michigan 49783. All materials shall be delivered with two copies of their respective MSDS.<BR>

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).
