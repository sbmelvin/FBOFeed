<DESC>This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light in tan features three white LEDs, two blue LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The white primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination; the blue secondary LEDs serve the same purpose in a low-signature, night-vision-friendly color.<BR><BR>The Helmet Light attaches via a special mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) by means of two socket-head machine screws. Once the mount is attached, the light can be easily slid onto the mount, where it locks in place; depressing a small lever slides it right off, so the Helmet Light can be quickly removed for servicing or transport onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest. <BR>

All investigators must have law enforcement authority as defined by the laws of the State of Ohio and at least three (3) years of law enforcement and investigation experience (experience in conducting fraud investigations, gathering evidence, interview witnesses and suspects, conducting undercover and surveillance work, and preparing investigative and administrative reports).  Clerical personnel must have at least 2 years of general clerical experience preferably with a law enforcement agency, a working knowledge of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, and a typing speed of 30-35 words per minute.   The NAICS code is 561611 and the size standard is $12.5M

The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.  Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be factored into subsequent procurement set-aside determinations and/or solicitation requirements.  No award will be made based on this synopsis. The information received will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources.   Requests for copies of a solicitation and/or telephone calls will not be honored or acknowledged.  No cost or pricing data is required or requested. 

Responses MUST be submitted via email to Syreeta.Gay@ssa.gov by 4:00 p.m. June 25, 2009.  The subject line of the submission should be “OIG Investigative & Clerical Services”.

Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes.

The amount of liability coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers, in order of importance:</p>
<p>Technical - Technical evaluation ratings for the items listed in the Statement of Need. The ratings will range from Acceptable, Reasonably susceptible to being made acceptable, to unacceptable. A complete justification will be prepared for each rating.</p>
<p>Past performance- will be given an overall general assessment risk rating. Performance risk relates to the assessment of an offeror's present and past work record to assess confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements.</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used in assessing performance risks on a scale ranging from exceptional to neutral that most accurately describes the contractor's performance or situation.</p>
<p><br />SCALE RATING DEFINITION</p>
<p>E Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements with many exceeded<br />To the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the<br />element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with no more<br />than a few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the<br />contractor were highly effective.</p>
<p>G Good Performance meets contractual requirements with some exceeded<br />to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the<br />element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with no more<br />than some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the<br />contractor were effective.</p>
<p>S Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual <br />performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor<br />problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were <br />satisfactory.</p>
<p>M Marginal Performance does not meet contractual requirements. The<br />Contractual performance of the element or sub-element<br />being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor<br />has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor's<br />proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not<br />fully implemented.</p>
<p>U Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements.<br />and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual<br />performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious<br />problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear<br />or were ineffective.<br /><br />N Neutral Performance was not observed or not applicable to the current<br />Effort being reported against.</p>
<p><br />Price - <br />(1) The Government will evaluate offers for award based on the realism and reasonableness of total price proposed for the solicitation.<br />(2) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best price, terms and conditions.<br />(3) Realism - Offerors are advised that unrealistically proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating an offer from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. Realism accesses whether the proposed price is compatible with the scope of effort and the requirements of the solicitation.<br />(4) Reasonable is defined as a price that provides best value to the Government when considering current market prices, wage determinations included in the solicitation and technical capabilities of the offeror. Also a fair price should ensure the offer a reasonable profit commensurate with performance.</p>
<p><br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>Contract award will be to the offeror who provides the offer most advantageous to the Government. The lowest priced proposal may not necessarily receive award; likewise, the highest rated technical proposal may not necessarily receive the award.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 - EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (January 1999)</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offeror's past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offer or accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offertory must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements documented in 52.212-1 and it's associated Addendum, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, including option prices if applicable, as identified on the Pricing Schedule (Supplies/Services pages) of this solicitation. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Item to confirm the extended amount for each; all extended prices will be added together and this final total will be compared against the figure annotated by the offeror in the price schedule. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on each offeror based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving all engineering, design, labor, travel, equipment, materials, training required to provide a complete functioning C5/C17 Mobile Tail Enclosure that are similar or greater in scope than the effort described in this solicitation; see Addendum to 52.212-1 for a detailed description of the factors considered relevant to this solicitation. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past and present performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence/, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3. Past and present performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past and present performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence,"meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past and present performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. In the event that the government does not make an award pursuant to paragraph D above, the government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance assessment rating of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions contained in 52.212-1 and it's associated Addendum; information shall enable the evaluator to fully ascertain each offeror's capability to perform all the requirements contemplated by this solicitation. Offerors may be asked, at the discretion of the Government, to provide additional information and clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past and present performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past and present performance is defined as past and present performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>G. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also an ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.
