<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Surface and Materials Measurement Science Division (MMSD) develops measurements and standards to support forensic characterization of explosives and narcotics using a variety of analytical methods. The ongoing work supports NIST's forensics program, Homeland Security programs, and programs with the Department of Defense that require sensitive instrumentation which can accurately separate and measure explosives and narcotics.
<p>The recent transfer of a Cameca IMS 6F SIMS instrument, serial number 644, from the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to MMSD will provide NIST an instrument capable of detecting, identifying and measuring organic and inorganic particles, greatly enhancing the work described above. Ownership of the 6F was transferred to NIST on April 23, 2013. The 6F was moved to NIST on April, 24, 2014, and currently resides, disconnected, on the NIST Gaithersburg, MD campus.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the installation, upgrade and recertification of the Cameca 6F. The acquisition also includes an option line item for a one year maintenance agreement. The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, parts, software and technology necessary to install the instrument, run diagnostic tests on the instrument, repair any defects, recertify the instrument, perform a software upgrade and provide maintenance for the instrument (if the option line item is exercised.)</p>
<p>Sole source determination is based on the following:</p>
<p>The IMS 6F SIMS instrument is a commercial item that was manufactured by Cameca Instruments, Inc. Cameca has proprietary rights to the existing equipment, including all hardware, software, technology and expertise, and is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the equipment. Cameca has no authorized resellers or service providers, therefore, only they can complete the required work and guarantee that the maintenance and parts will be fully compatible with, and meet the original performance specifications for the equipment.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219 and the size standard is $19.0 M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by July 18, 2014 will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Surgery Branch (SB) plans to procure on a sole source basis a service contract for 40,000 input genomes, and 200,000 TCR sequences survey which includes a DNA Extraction Fee and domestic shipping and handling, from<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Adaptive Biotechnologies, 1551 Eastlake Ave E #200, Seattle, WA 98102. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">This process will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisitions procedures as stated in FAR Part 13 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt for the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">541711, and the business size standard is 500.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.&nbsp; Note: The period of performance has not been detemined at this time. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute has a dual function at the NIH. Investigators in the Branch are involved in the conduct of laboratory and clinical research aimed at improving the care, management, and outcome of patients with cancer. Important areas of laboratory research include tumor immunology, immunotherapy and gene therapy of solid tumors, epigenetic changes in pulmonary malignancies, tumor stem cells, and molecular changes in breast carcinogenesis. In these studies, an emphasis is placed on the translation of laboratory findings into the development of clinical protocols. Clinical efforts emphasize the development of new approaches to the immunotherapy of cancer, to the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of solid tumors, as well as the development of innovative surgical and adjunctive approaches to the treatment of patients with primary and metastatic cancer. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">T cells express a T cell receptor (TCR) on the cell surface that determines their specificity. A TCR is created by selecting and splicing together a single V, D and J segment from a collection of available genomic segments. At the junctions between V-D and D-J segments, a varying number of nucleotides are deleted and a special enzyme inserts random nucleotides, creating a unique TCR. It is these inserted nucleotides that are responsible for the vast diversity found in the human TCR repertoire. T cell receptor immune-profiling can be used to monitor T cell responses to a given immune challenge even without the knowledge of the specific epitope <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>targeted. NCI is particularly interested in performing TCR sequencing from T cell populations isolated from human tumor samples. In the tumors, T cells are exposed to tumor antigens, and the frequency of a specific TCR clono type could be indicative of its ability to recognize the tumor. Thus, the study of the intra tumoral T cell repertoire may lead to novel ways to rapidly identify and isolate TCRs that can be used to treat patients with cancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technology necessary to sequence the hyper variable region of the TCR involves a multiplex PCR with a mixture of primers targeting the rearranged variable and joining segments to capture receptor diversity. Differential hybridization kinetics can introduce significant amplification biases that alter the composition of sequence libraries and potentially biasing the data obtained. To identify and minimize such biases Adaptive Biotechnologies uses a synthetic immune receptor repertoire, which enables the computational removal residual bias after sequencing. Adaptive Biotechnologies has invented a patent-pending technology that utilizes advances in high-throughput sequencing and a state-of-the-art computer infrastructure to provide researchers in-depth analysis of the T-cell receptor repertoire. With this technology, scientists are able to identify the exact makeup of approximately 10-15 million unique TCRs in one individual, compared to previous techniques that could catalog only about 30,000. In addition to the qualifications of Adaptive to perform this service they provide their service at a highly competitive price. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Finally, </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">TCR deep sequencing is a relatively new and evolving technology and Adaptive Biotechnologies has pioneered this technology and made it commercially available. Adaptive Biotechnologies has 6+ years of a proven track record, including a growing list of clients, and their services have resulted in the publication of numerous articles in peer reviewed scientific journals, and has works in close contact with the Surgery Branch in providing state-of-the-art technology and superior serving. No other company provides the services provided by Adaptive Biotechnologies, including TCR sequencing and personalized analysis adapted to each project at such a competitive price. NCI has been working with Adaptive technologies and have performed some control experiments to test their technology, even with low starting cell number (&lt;10,000), and have received accurate results back. Thus, the results provided by Adaptive Biotechnologies have proven to be reliable, and give NCI confidence to proceed using their technology. Finally, the service contract provided by Adaptive Biotechnologies will provide the necessary tools NCI needs to study the TCR repertoire of intratumoral T cell subsets and may help NCI identify and isolate tumor-specific T cell receptors. Adaptive Biotechnologies has exclusively&nbsp;in-licensed a patent family from the FHRCR called&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Method of Measuring Adaptive Immunity. This patent provides exclusive access to the proprietary sequencing technology developed by Harlan Robins and Chris Carlson at the FHCRC.&nbsp;Adaptive has an 11 step sample preparation methodology which goes way beyond competition to standardize the template (genetic material) that is loaded onto the sequencer.&nbsp;In addition, Adaptive has written <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>seven <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>propriety software programs that "clean the data" after it comes off the sequencer.&nbsp; These steps remove bias, correct errors, and have other quality control mechanisms built in. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Thus based on this information </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Adaptive Biotechnologies </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">is the only known source for this service. </span></p>

<p>ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334516-Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with associated small business size standard 500 employees.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provides a stimulating setting for a comprehensive effort to understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator-initiated research, in this regard. The Laboratory of Neurogenetics at NIA in the IRP is tasked with finding the genes and gene mutations that cause or contribute to neurological disease. These discoveries allow the transfer of those genes and mutations into cells in order to make a model which helps the field to better understand disease processes. As more is understood about the disease progression additional models can be used to test therapies.</p>
<p>The NIA, IRP, LN has a potential requirement for a laboratory instrument for the analysis, characterization and timely purification of exosomes in existing research. The essential government feature that this potential requirement needs to achieve is obtaining a tunable resistive pulse sensor (TRPS) type device, which accurately characterizes and differentiates between exosome particles in the size range required (50 to 200 nm particle size), achieving a method capable of distinguishing between distinct particle size groups within the range desired (dynamic light scattering (DLS) and particle tracking analysis(PTA)). A primary focus of the Laboratory of Neurosciences is to study basic mechanisms and elucidate potential therapies directed to neurodegenerative  diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral sclerosis. There is a growing body of scientific evidence describing the role exosomes in cell/cell signaling events in normal and disease states, including neurodegenerative diseases.All deliveries must be made FOB destination to 251 Bayview Blvd; Baltimore, MD, 21224.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/ solicitation number remains the same: </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">N02RC42535-83. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 20) 05-72, (January 2014) Simplified Procedures for a Commercial Item. The Government contemplates only one award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. The Associated North America Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 541711 and the Business Size Standard is 500. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute has a dual function at the NIH. Investigators in the Branch are involved in the conduct of laboratory and clinical research aimed at improving the care, management, and outcome of patients with cancer. Important areas of laboratory research include tumor immunology, immunotherapy and gene therapy of solid tumors, epigenetic changes in pulmonary malignancies, tumor stem cells, and molecular changes in breast carcinogenesis. In these studies, an emphasis is placed on the translation of laboratory findings into the development of clinical protocols. Clinical efforts emphasize the development of new approaches to the immunotherapy of cancer, to the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of solid tumors, as well as the development of innovative surgical and adjunctive approaches to the treatment of patients with primary and metastatic cancer. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">T cells express a T cell receptor (TCR) on the cell surface that determines their specificity. A TCR is created by selecting and splicing together a single V, D and J segment from a collection of available genomic segments. At the junctions between V-D and D-J segments, a varying number of nucleotides are deleted and a special enzyme inserts random nucleotides, creating a unique TCR. It is these inserted nucleotides that are responsible for the vast diversity found in the human TCR repertoire. T cell receptor immune-profiling can be used to monitor T cell responses to a given immune challenge even without the knowledge of the specific epitope <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>targeted. NCI is particularly interested in performing TCR sequencing from T cell populations isolated from human tumor samples. In the tumors, T cells are exposed to tumor antigens, and the frequency of a specific TCR clonotype could be indicative of its ability to recognize the tumor. Thus, the study of the intratumoral T cell repertoire may lead to novel ways to rapidly identify and isolate TCRs that can be used to treat patients with cancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technology necessary to sequence the hyper variable region of the TCR involves a multiplex PCR with a mixture of primers targeting the rearranged variable and joining segments to capture receptor diversity. Differential hybridization kinetics can introduce significant amplification biases that alter the composition of sequence libraries and potentially biasing the data obtained. To identify and minimize such biases Adaptive Biotechnologies uses a synthetic immune receptor repertoire, which enables the computational removal residual bias after sequencing. Adaptive Biotechnologies has invented a patent-pending technology that utilizes advances in high-throughput sequencing and a state-of-the-art computer infrastructure to provide researchers in-depth analysis of the T-cell receptor repertoire. With this technology, scientists are able to identify the exact makeup of approximately 10-15 million unique TCRs in one individual, compared to previous techniques that could catalog only about 30,000. In addition to the qualifications of Adaptive to perform this service they provide their service at a highly competitive price. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Finally, </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">TCR deep sequencing is a relatively new and evolving technology and Adaptive Biotechnologies has pioneered this technology and made it commercially available. Adaptive Biotechnologies has 6+ years of a proven track record, including a growing list of clients, and their services have resulted in the publication of numerous articles in peer reviewed scientific journals, and has works in close contact with the Surgery Branch in providing state-of-the-art technology and superior serving. No other company provides the services provided by Adaptive Biotechnologies, including TCR sequencing and personalized analysis adapted to each project at such a competitive price. NCI has been working with Adaptive technologies and have performed some control experiments to test their technology, even with low starting cell number (&lt;10,000), and have received accurate results back. Thus, the results provided by Adaptive Biotechnologies have proven to be reliable, and give NCI confidence to proceed using their technology. Finally, the service contract provided by Adaptive Biotechnologies will provide the necessary tools NCI needs to study the TCR repertoire of intratumoral T cell subsets and may help NCI identify and isolate tumor-specific T cell receptors. Adaptive Biotechnologies has exclusively&nbsp;in-licensed a patent family from the FHRCR called&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Method of Measuring Adaptive Immunity. This patent provides exclusive access to the proprietary sequencing technology developed by Harlan Robins and Chris Carlson at the FHCRC.&nbsp;Adaptive has an 11 step sample preparation methodology which goes way beyond competition to standardize the template (genetic material) that is loaded onto the sequencer.&nbsp;In addition,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Adaptive has written <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>seven <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>propriety software programs that "clean the data" after it comes off the sequencer.&nbsp; These steps remove bias, correct errors, and have other quality control mechanisms built in. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Thus based on this information </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Adaptive Biotechnologies </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">is the only known source for this service. </span></p>
