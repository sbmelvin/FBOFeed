<DESC><br />The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedure (dollar threshold of $100,000), for expert services from Joseph Swerdzewski and Aassociates, 6585 HWY 431 South, Suite E457, Hampton Cove, AL 35763-9230. Under the authority of FAR 6.301-1 10 U.S.C. 2304 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. The purpose of this request is to obtain research, analysis and consultative services in pursuit of a new Master Labor Agreement (MLA) to include advice and guidance on Executive Order 13522 which requires the establishment of a cooperative and productive form of labor-management relations within CMS. The current MLA between the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 (AFGE or the Union), expires this year and in anticipation of its expiration, CMS must begin preparing for negotiations. The agency is in need of expert assistance for research, analysis and consultative services regarding all aspects of implementation and post implementation (including litigation) of a new MLA, and the establishment of a cooperative form of labor management relations within CMS. Specialized experience in federal sector labor relations or direct specialized experience working with Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) case law is critical to fulfilling the agencies needs for research, analysis and consultative services in pursuit of a new MLA. There is only one potential contractor who is currently available and possesses the necessary expertise and experience to provide the specific consultative services deemed necessary by the Agency to ensure a successful and timely implementation of a new MLA for the agency. Mr. Swerdzewski, served as the General Counsel for the FLRA for two terms. He has over 20 years working in the FLRA, an agency that oversees and sets the standard for federal labor relations. He has worked both sides in the authority as a staff attorney dealing directly with agencies, and he has been in charge of the FLRA. In the Federal labor relations community, he is well known for his advice and policy memorandums on labor relations topics for the federal sector, which he issued, while General Counsel. The inside knowledge and experience that Mr. Swerdzewski has gained while working for the FLRA has equipped him with specialized experience in federal labor relations theories, principles and practices, problems precedents, regulations, and concepts pertaining to Federal labor relations. For CMS's upcoming negotiations and involvement in establishing a labor management forum within CMS, this specialized experience is needed to ensure that the agency negotiates the best contract possible and in the most efficient manner. In addition, the agency needs to make sure that it meets the criteria of Executive Order 13522. Other potential candidates reviewed didn't come close to possessing the knowledge and the experience needed to negotiate a Union-management labor agreement in a federal environment. All responsible sources may submit capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency in accordance with the requirements in the synopsis and the attached Statement of Work. The period of performance is July 1, 2010 - June 31, 2011. NAICS CODE is 541990.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Space SystemsCompany (LMSSC) 7474 Greenway Center Drive, Greenbelt, MD 20770 for systems anddiscipline engineering services in support of the development and execution of two GSFCdeveloped Station Development Technical Objectives (SDTOs). These infrastructuredemonstrations will take place on the International Space Station (ISS) and are designedto be launched on a space shuttle or a government-provided expendable launch vehicle withan October 2010 delivery to the launch site. NASA/GSFC plans to award LMSSC a cost plusfixed fee contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, with anestimated 18 month period of performance. The proposed cost plus fixed fee contract will include the following efforts related tothe SDTOs: requirements definition and verification, hardware design, support of flighthardware fabrication, development of avionics, assembly of ground support equipment (GSE)and harnesses, software development support, interface control planning anddocumentation, mission planning, support of mission execution, and mission analysis. TheContractor will provide the integration and testing support as well as the necessaryprogram management and quality assurance to support the contract activities. The LMSSC team has unique knowledge and experience in several specific areas required forthis effort: flying a payload on a man-rated vehicle, working with the ISS robot, Dextre,developing space-qualified tools, interfacing with the ISS infrastructure, and performingsystems engineering support within the GSFC development environment in accordance with anaggressive schedule requirement. LMSSCs involvement with the Hubble Space Telescope(HST) servicing missions has given them experience in the critical systems engineeringskills required for planning, developing and executing activities in a man-rated spaceenvironment. In addition to having experience with designing for an astronaut-rated environment, LMSSCis also experienced with the Dextre robot having worked with this robot during the HSTRobotic Servicing and De-orbit Module (HRSDM) effort. The extensive knowledge of roboticservicing gained by LMSSC and its understanding of the workings of Dextre has producedengineering results critical to the successful performance of these, especially withinthe timeframe needed to meet the aggressive schedule of these payloads. Furthermore, theLMSSC team has unique and extensive experience in space-rated tool development gained onfive previous HST servicing missions and has been working with NASA on developing robotictools. The body of knowledge and expertise accumulated by LMSSC and its subcontractorteam during nearly 20 years of on-orbit servicing activities makes it the onlyresponsible source capable of meeting the technical requirements within the scheduleconstraints. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 5:00 PM EDT on April3rd 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This notice is for informational purposes only. This opportunity is available only to PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS (PWC) as a logical follow-on task order in accordance with FAR 8.405-6 (b) (2). The new work is a logical follow-on to N10PD40062, which was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures.
PWC will support the Interior Recovery Office in complying with Recovery Act recipient reporting requirements to include OMB memorandum M-10-08 and support bureaus in monitoring the progress of their own programs, completing and submitting required reports with an appropriate level of data quality, and complying with recipient reporting. 
Task 1: Recipient Reporting SupportN10PD40062 included limited contractor support for recipient reporting. However, DOI's responsibilities for preparing for recipient reporting and reviewing the quality of data submitted by recipients were expanded as a result of OMB memorandum M-10-08 (dated December 18, 2009) entitled "Updated Guidance on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - Data Quality, Non-Reporting Recipients, and Reporting of Job Estimates."  The Interior Recovery Office now requires support in gathering the data from the bureaus, maintaining a master log of recipients and providing the information in an automated fashion to recipients.  The Interior Recovery Office also requires support in reviewing the reports, commenting on reports with errors or inaccuracies, maintaining a log of non-reporters, and maintaining a log of all recipient reports with errors and inaccuracies. PWC assisted DOI in implementing an initial solution to comply with OMB memorandum M-10-08 to provide key award information to recipients. PWC understands the Interior environment and issues and risks for Interior in overseeing recipient reporting. PWC has a strong understanding of each bureau's issues in preparing for and participating in recipient reporting. Due to the knowledge and experience gained from supporting N10PD40062, PWC is uniquely capable of providing the expanded recipient reporting support needed by the Interior Recovery Office. 
Task 2: Support Bureau Oversight of Recovery ActN10PD40062 included contractor support for the bureaus in preparing and submitting program performance data on a monthly basis. It was assumed that limited direct support of the bureaus would be needed at the conclusion of this task. In December of 2009, Secretary Salazar issued a memorandum to all Bureaus requesting that all projects be mobilized by June 2010, requiring bureaus to accelerate project awards.  To meet this acceleration target, bureaus will have to aggressively monitor project performance to ensure award dates and mobilization dates are achieved. Acceleration of award also introduces additional potential risk for project completion.  Bureaus will need to monitor project completion to ensure there is no waste, fraud or abuse of government fiscal resources. The purpose of Task 2 is to remedy the bureau-level monitoring issues. PWC has an in-depth understanding of the data quality issues in bureau performance reports and the level of monitoring that is being conducted by the bureaus and any resource constraints. PWC personnel supported bureaus in documenting their acceleration strategy and have a good understanding of the risks associated with the strategies. PWC personnel have developed a good working relationship with their bureau counterparts.  With the June 2010 acceleration deadline quickly approaching, there is no time for a learning curve or for another contractor to become acclimated in the bureaus environments.  
All questions regarding this procurement must be submitted via email to Alexis_N_Williams@nbc.gov with "RECIPIENT REPORTING AND BUREAU DIRECT SUPPORT" in the subject line. Questions submitted by a method other than electronic mail shall not be accepted and shall not be answered.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland intends to negotiate and award a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Coherent, Inc. in Santa Clara, CA for One (1) MIRA 900D, Tri:S laser system, P/N 1043518.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500.</p>
<p>The system required shall be an upgrade to an existing laser system originally purchased from Coherent Laser Group. This laser light source shall be used in the development of a video rate for a, Coherent Raman Scattering Optical Microscope.</p>
<p>To increase the stability and useable spectral coverage of a Coherent Raman Scattering Optical Microscope, NIST requires a matched laser source that is a direct upgrade for the existing laser system.</p>
<p>Coherent Laser Group's Mira 900D, Ti:S laser system with cavity length control will be locked (same rep rate and phase) to NIST's existing Mira 900P's internal crystal oscillator frequency. To achieve the necessary, high fidelity lock across a broad bandwidth pulse (100 nm) and to take full advantage of the pre-existing wavelength optimization servos, matched Ti:S oscillators are required.</p>
<p>Coherent Laser Group has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology. The upgrade must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment. The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to Coherent Laser Group. Coherent Laser Group has no distributors; therefore, they are the only source capable of providing this upgrade.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by April 2, 2010 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Pfeiffer Vacuum Company (Pfeiffer) of Nashua, New Hampshire, for the purchase of a Prisma Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA), C-SEM Detector, Open Ion Source, YT Filament, 200 Degree Celsius Bakeout, Catalog #PT M25 252, Model #QMA200M, Yt. <br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the following:<br />The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology Division (CNST) of NIST requires a Pfieffer RGA so that the RGA head in this purchase can be operated from CNST's existing Pfeiffer Prisma Control Electronics and Pfeiffer Quadra software. CNST uses one (1) Control Electronics to operate multiple RGA heads on different vacuum systems to save costs. In addition, CNST requires compatibility and interchangeability with existing Pfeiffer QMA200M heads to allow critical experiments to continue operating in case of failure. Pfeiffer produces the only commercially-available product to ensure total compatibility with the existing system. Products from other manufacturers can be used with the exisiting system; however, significant changes would need to be completed in-house to accommodate upgrading the existing system with products from other manufacturers, of which would also create unnecessary effort, time and cost. As a result, Pfeiffer is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, Maryland, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Sotax Corporation (Sotax) of Horsham, Pennsylvania, for the purchase of a Sotax CE7 Smart USP Apparatus.<br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the following:<br />The Surface and Microanalysis Science Division (SMSD) of NIST is developing standards for the Department of Homeland Security. These standards are typically comprised of a polymeric material containing known amounts of explosives of which are later used to test ion mobility spectrometers and/or explosive screening portals commonly located at airports. Accordingly, it is necessary to test the stability and diffusion processes that occur over time. These existing technologies are being leveraged for the development of novel drug delivery standards for pharmaceutical applications. SMSD thusly requires a flow-through dissolution system in order to validate the stability of these standards in water and to study the release characteristics in similar drug delivery systems.<br />The dissolution system sought must allow for characterization of both microspheres and thin films and be a United States Pharmacopeia apparatus 4 (USP-4) flow-through system with special cells provided for both dissolution measurements of microspheres and thin films on 1 cm substrates. Additional flow cells specific for characterization for drug eluting stents must be readily available for future purchase. The system must have a pump that achieves a flow rate in the range of 1.6 to 38 ml per minute. The system must be able to operate at least seven (7) different samples simultaneously for statistical analysis. The system must be fully-automated and flow directly into a UV spectrophotometer. The software must be fully compatible with SMSD's computer systems. The system must also be compatible with a previously-utilized FDA dissolution system in which earlier data was published (Sotax USP-4 flow-through model) on drug testing stents. Installation and operational consultation is required, as is a warranty of at least one (1) year from date of approved installation.<br />The Sotax CE7 Smart USP Apparatus is known to be the only commercially-available hardware and software system to ensure compatibility the existing system. Products from other manufacturers can be used with the exisiting system; however, significant changes would need to be completed in-house to accommodate upgrading the existing system with products from other manufacturers, of which would also create unnecessary effort, time and cost. As a result, Sotax is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirements.</p>

<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 PM ET on Friday, April 2, 2010. Inquiries will be accepted via email at charles.koehler@nist.gov.

Description
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB), Behavioral Research Program (BRP) plans to procure on a sole source basis the services of  Rand Corporation; 1776 Main Street; Santa Monica, CA 90407 to provide scientific support to the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) for survey development, dissemination and data users through the use of social networking technology.
The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0 million.  

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

Period of Performance: Performance shall be for the twelve (12) months from date of award.

The Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB) in the Behavioral Research Program (BRP) in the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) at the NCI is charged with planning, developing, disseminating, and coordinating research on health communication relevant to cancer prevention and control.  The HINTS survey was designed to support the mission of HCIRB and NCI by providing a vehicle for systematic surveillance of the American publics cancer-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.  HINTS is conducted biennially by the NCI. HINTS aims to assess the publics use of health information and to provide the extramural community of behavioral, social, and communication scientists access to a data source for conducting hypothesis-generating and policy-informing research on the links between health communication and cancer prevention and control.  HINTS completed its third administration (HINTS 2007-2008) in 2009; NCI  expanding collaborative access to this data source, and to enable public participation in the development of the next HINTS survey (HINTS 4), to be fielded in 2011.

The contractor shall provide services to complete four tasks/products to accomplish the goals of expanding access related to HINTS activities. NCI seeks to create a tool that enables researchers to navigate HINTS and HINTS research at the item-level (a HINTS item network; Task 1); use social networking technology to allow researchers to engage in a participatory process during the development of the HINTS 4 instrument (HINTS-GEM; Task 2); produce a collaboration guide that enables researchers to field HINTS at the state-level or in an international setting (Collaboration Guide; Task 3); and, strategically integrate HINTS data into existing NIH initiatives (Task 4).

The contractor shall have specific knowledge of the HINTS program and data infrastructure, including (a) knowledge of existing HINTS instruments; (b) experience with the development of previous iterations of the survey; (c) knowledge related to health information technology; and (d) ability to prepare materials for local and national conferences meant to disseminate the products of the NCIs efforts related to HINTS in these very specific areas.

The RAND Corporation possesses the specific expertise in health information technology and has worked extensively in this area.  RAND completed a series of studies to assess the potential for widespread use of electronic medical records and to identify relevant government policy options.  This project was the first known effort to quantify, at a national level, the health care quality improvements and savings related to full and partial integration of information technology into health care delivery.  The NCI knows of no other entity that possesses the necessary expertise.

Additionally, RAND is uniquely positioned to carry out the tasks described above because its personnel has worked on the redesign of the HINTS website; conducted multiple HINTS analyses that resulted in several peer-reviewed manuscripts and conference presentations at national and international conferences; worked closely with HINTS leadership to develop content and a sampling plan for the most recent iteration of HINTS (HINTS 2007); and assisted in several HINTS dissemination activities (e.g., creation of HINTS briefs and the recent Cancer Communication:  Health Information National Trends Survey 2003 and 2005 report).  Rands experiences both supporting the development of the HINTS program and as a HINTS user have given them a distinctive expertise and programmatic insight essential to the activities of HCIRB and the HINTS program.  

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:&nbsp;</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contract Data Management Program (CDMP) within the NIH Office of Acquisition &amp; Logistics Management (OALM) requires the services of a contractor to support several unique systems and provide extensive data reports that draw from several complex acquisition systems across NIH.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A contract with a base year (600 hours) and a one year option (450 hours) is required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The NIH Contractor Performance System (CPS) is a multi-agency shared file database system that efficiently and economically collects, maintains, and disseminates contractor performance information throughout the federal government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All facets of contractor performance are completely automated from the initiation of an evaluation by a government contracting official through the government program official's entering his/her evaluation into the system, to the contractor's retrieval, review and entering rebuttal comments on each evaluation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The past performance information can be entered and retrieved by authorized users anywhere in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>OALM was innovative in developing and marketing the CPS government-wide emphasizing the benefits of sharing information and reducing costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The outcome has been an efficient and inexpensive system that ensures a timely and consistent method of collecting and reviewing evaluations of a contractor's performance, past and present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CPS, however, is being revised and potentially revamped, adding new feeds to <a href="http://www.ppirs.gov/"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; text-underline: none">Past Performance Information Retrieval System</span></a> (PPIRS), and including other updates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>In addition to the on-going effort of attempting to keep up with the various activities, which involve thousands of customers, and continuing improvements or changes to the two systems, the CDMP has significant responsibilities for developing and managing approaches to use the Departmental Contract Information System (DCIS) for monitoring data, management reporting, and fulfilling special requests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will support OALM on several reporting initiatives that will be on-going at NIH over the proposed period of performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In particular, improvement and validation of DCIS and automating DCIS feeds to other systems in a manner that ensures consistency of data between the systems is underway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>In addition, the reporting required under the American Recovery Act has significantly increased the number of data calls and request for reports through the CDMP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, to ensure timeliness of reporting, the contractor will support various report preparation activities within the OALM/CDMP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

Proposed Issue Date:  19 March 2010"	Title of Project:  GRCA - CONSTRUCT 64 UNIT HIGH DENSITY EMPLOYEE HOUSING"	Description:  The work of this contract consists of the construction of 64 high density units in a multi-family setting, in accordance with NPS standards, including parking, roads, sidewalks, utilities, and landscaping. The 32 one-bedroom and 32 two bedroom apartments will provide a flexible housing solution for permanent and seasonal employees and offer up to 96 bedrooms at full capacity. It is anticipated that both required and non-required occupants will occupy these units (approximately 50% of each, with the flexibility to adjust as seasonal/permanent and required/non-required housing needs fluctuates.) This project, coupled with a short term project for temporary housing will meet the immediate needs for housing on the South Rim. The estimated construction cost, including utilities, parking, sidewalks and landscaping, was well under the Housing budget cost model back when the project was initiated and submitted for approval.  Utilities are already on the selected site or within approximately 150 feet. This should be a very cost effective solution to the immediate housing needs of Grand Canyon. The existing trailers at the proposed site will be removed and disposed of, taking care of the existing health and safety hazards of the units and site. Housing units have water leaks and resulting damage. They are infested with mice and insects creating hantavirus and insect health hazards. Egress windows are undersized per current code. Electrical service needs to be upgraded; it is not grounded, has no GFCI's and doesn't meet current code. 
"	Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.

"	Estimated price range, over $10 million."	Time for completion, 365 calendar days. "	Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available."	All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.

<DESC>NSWC Panama City Division, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Circuit Services LLC, dba Career Technologies, 18634 Parthenia St Ste 3, Northridge, CA 91324-5332 on a sole-source basis for the re-layout of the Auxiliary Module (P/N 53771-7449680) circuit, design of the production representative enclosure, fabrication of a first piece module for government testing, and production of five (5) additional modules.  Career Technologies has key design knowledge of the Auxiliary Module having produced the item successfully before.   Moreover, the company has the original circuit layouts created by their engineering staff, archived in its native Gerber digital format.  The Government already has a significant investment in the nonrecurring engineering undertaken by Career technologies and to start anew with a different vendor would result in incurring these costs again.  The company and its personnel have critical technical knowledge pertaining to the design of this item.  Using any other source for this effort would significantly increase cost, program schedule and technical risk.  It is estimated that using any other source for this effort would increase delivery time for this hardware by 100% and cost, due to a significant nonrecurring engineering effort, by 500%. 
The NAICS code is 334418 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. FSC code 5998.Contract Specialist: Scott Dubuque, Code B31, NSWC PC, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001 (850) 234-4864, FAX (850) 234-4251 or email at scott.dubuque@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE.  The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start (OHS), through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Zero to Three, 2000 M Street, Northwest Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036, TO EXTEND ITS CURRENT CONTRACT, number HHSP23320042900YC, for six (6) months.  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

OHS is seeking a six-month extension to its contract for the Early Head Start National Resource Center (EHSNRC) with Zero to Three.  Zero to Three provides technical assistance (TA) and support to more than 700 Early Head Start (EHS) programs across the country serving 62,000 children and families.  As a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), an additional 600 programs were recently funded, serving an additional 50,000 children.  This funding created almost twice the number of Early Head Start (EHS) grantees.  All grantees are required to attend national orientation to begin work with pregnant woman, infants and toddlers.  Two of the orientations are taking place through the current contract period and two additional national orientations will take place 2 to 3 weeks after the current contracts expiration.  The OHS is working with the PSC to get a follow-on contract in place; however a long, competitive acquisition process is expected, which will exceed the current contracts expiration.  Services cannot be suspended between the time the current contract expires and a new contract is awarded.  The 600 new grantees need immediate and continued support.  A break in service will jeopardize support services to newly awarded ARRA-funded expansion grantees.  Zero to Three is the only firm with the capacity to complete the tasks that must be continued though the spring of 2010.

The statement of work will remain the same during the extension period.  The following tasks need to continue, uninterrupted, to accommodate the funding of the 600 new ARRA EHS grantees.  

1.  Maintain and monitor the toll-free number and phone and email information requests.  The current system will need to be expanded to include new parties. 

2.  Plan and conduct Leadership Seminars.  In response to the ARRA funding, OHS has hired new federal staff across the country to award funding and monitor newly awarded grantees.  Zero to Three will conduct Leadership Seminars during winter and spring, 2010.

3.  Plan and conduct National Orientation Conference.  The OHS requires that new grantees attend a National Orientation Conference.  Two National Orientation Conferences will be held during the extension period.  New grantees are required to attend a National Orientation Conference.

4.  Disseminating materials to Federal Staff, TA staff and newly awarded ARRA EHS programs.  Materials are disseminated to all federal, TA and program staff to ensure everyone has the same information.  The material is also used to build capacity of new programs at the individual program level.  

Zero to Three is uniquely qualified to continue the tasks and complete them in the 6 month time period.  Zero to Three has been the contractor for the EHSNRC, since Early Head Start was established in 1995.  Zero to Three trains and supports professionals, policymakers and parents in their efforts to improve the lives of infants and toddlers.  In the initial funding of Early Head Start grantees in 1996, and the expansions in the few years following, Zero to Three took a leadership role in providing services, resources, materials, and training to new grantees.  Early Head Start presented unique challenges to the Head Start community, and Zero to Threes EHSNRC has provided outstanding leadership and support to the federal government and new grantees.  

Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required in the timeframe required.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, REQUEST FOR SUCH DOCUMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID RESPONSES.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the modification.

The vessel will provide transportation and support for the science crew of 6 people working for USGS and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS).
The objective of the cruise will be to deploy satellite-linked radio-tags from small workboats on walruses within the sea ice margin. Two workboats will be provided by USGS for the field work and must be loaded onto the charter vessel from a port with road access near Anchorage, Alaska. The work area will be the southeastern Chukchi Sea at the southern end of the retreating pack ice. The vessel will operate within the sea ice margin.

A fixed price type purchase order is contemplated for this requirement. Competitive procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, will be utilized. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is the best value to the government. Vessel suitability, as determined by a USGS project leader/inspector, will be a main factor in selecting the contract vessel.

It is anticipated that a Request for Quote (RFQ) will be issued and be available upon request on or about April 5, 2010 with proposals due on or about April 14,2010. All RFQ requests shall be made via e-mail to jglenn@usgs.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered. Note: Funding is not yet available for this effort.

Deliveries forthe M220 propelling charges would need to commence in October 2010 with aminimum required production capability of 160,000 units per month.  Deliveries for the M204 propelling charges would need to commence in May 2012with a minimum required production capability of 160,000 units per month.The M220 Propelling Charges consist of two (2) components: a molded felted fiber nitrocellulose case (increment container) and (M38) ball powder propellant. The M204 Propelling Charges also consist of two (2) components: a molded felted fiber nitrocellulose case (increment container) and M10 flake powder propellant.  The propellant is loaded into the increment container and then sealed, which makes up the completed propelling charge.  The propelling charge is placed over the fin.  When the ignition cartridge is ignited, it flashes through the holes in the fin assembly and sets off the propellantcharges.  The burning of the increment container and propellant produces thegas pressure to force the mortar cartridge out of the tube and down range.  The M220 propelling charge supports the M889A1/M889A2/M821A2 81mm highexplosive cartridges and the M879 81mm full range practice cartridge and theM204 propelling charge supports the M888 60mm high explosive cartridge and theM722A1 60mm WP Smoke cartridge.Interested sources should demonstrate that they currently possess the experience and capability, necessary to fabricate, assemble and inspect the referenced quantities of propelling charges and deliver to Load Assembly and Pack facility prior to required date. Interested sources should also possess the necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver these propelling charges at a high rate of production.  Interested sources should also possess capability to obtain safety clearance to handle up to Hazard Class 1.3 explosives/hazardous components.

A.  STATEMENT OF DUTIES

1.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Department of State (DOS) is required to provide for the personal protection and safety of personnel under Chief of Mission authority and designated Chief of Mission facilities in Iraq.

DOS needs a capability to provide secure, safe QRF transport, Search and Rescue / MEDEVAC, route reconnaissance and convoy escort, and air transportation of personnel and equipment in support of Embassy programs.  To accomplish the mission a fleet of aircraft, potentially including fixed wing aircraft, light lift helicopters and medium lift helicopters will be required.  The aircraft will perform their missions during the hours of daylight and darkness (to include Night Vision Goggles) under both visual meteorological conditions and instrument meteorological conditions.  Aircraft and crew must be available on a 24 hour basis to meet the needs of the U.S. Mission in Iraq.

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this personal services contract (PSC) position is to provide a Senior Aviation Advisor for the U.S. Mission in Iraq.  The incumbent serves as the senior in-country aviation advisor, responsible to Diplomatic Security for providing program implementation, direction, and execution oversight in support of aviation transportation services in Iraq for Search and Rescue (SAR) and medical evacuations (ME), transporting Quick Reaction Forces (QRF) to respond to incidents, and where noted, provide air transportation (AT) for Chief of Mission personnel or other personnel required by Government to conduct official business.

<p>&bull; ASA24 Administration and Versioning. In addition to maintaining the existing system capability of assigning roles and deleting Users, the Contractor shall create a tool or system to track, maintain, and manage usage of multiple versions of the ASA24 System. This tool should allow current users to maintain the status quo or upgrade to the most current version, based on preference. Versions may differ based on updates to nutrient/food group/supplement databases, updates to the Graphic User Interface (GUI), and updates for a country-specific version.</p>
<p>&bull; Enhancements of the ASA24 Respondent Website. In addition to maintaining the existing system, the Contractor shall add new features to the GUI including the addition of more animation/movement to the existing animated agent to better guide respondents. The Contractor shall also create at least two additional agent characters to add interest to the software, and shall develop new tutorial and help systems. Updates to the search system are required, as is a thorough review and update of the existing food list used for browsing, to improve usability. Additional features that require development are the addition of a "Favorites" function allowing Respondent Users to create a list of foods they designate as commonly consumed that would be available to them upon subsequent administrations of ASA24), upon, and adaptations for children.</p>
<p>&bull; Enhancement of the ASA24 Researcher Website. The ASA24 System includes a website to register Researcher Users. The Contractor will be responsible for improving the process for registering studies, including the import of files, validation of import files, the generation of passwords for Respondent Users, and the creation of study-specific logos. The Contractor shall also improve the display for respondent tracking, sorting of respondent identifiers, analytic modules for nutrients, food groups and supplements, and provide options for automated reports and updates for Researcher Users. The Contractor shall also provide ongoing support and trouble shooting for Researcher Users and shall continuously monitor all websites and website documents to be up-to-date and accurate.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, P.O. Box 500, Top of BH Observatory Road at 13, Milton, MA 02186-0998 for the following requirement: This requirement is intended to provide all personnel, equipment, materials, services and facilities (except as otherwise specified), to perform the following: The Government will provide necessary maintenance (ASOS) required for the continuous function of Government owned equipment located at the observatory. The contractor shall record data and remarks on forms B-16 (Surface Weather Observations), F-6 (Preliminary Local Climatological Data) and B-83B (Record of Reference-Climatological Station Observations) for previous 24 hours, download ASOS data, compare ASOS data with other older technologies for the previous 24 hours, and update computer files including documents and spreadsheets, for the NOAA National Weather Service, Observations &amp; Facilities Branch, 630 Johnson Ave., Bohemia, New York. All work to be in accordance with the Statement of Work included in the solicitation. The period of performance is April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011, with priced options for four (4) additional years. Deliverables to be delivered to NOAA National Weather Service, Observations &amp; Facilities Branch, 630 Johnson Ave., Bohemia, New York. In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract. For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm. Authority: 41 USC 253(c)(1). The FSC for this is R427 and the NAICS Code is 541990, small business size standard is $6.5 million. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. The Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory is the sole provider for climatological weather observations and services at this site. The Federal government has stated that climate change is a national priority. This site is the only site where climate data has been collected in the same location for over 125 years. The cost to maintain this service is minimal for the support of climatic change research. The Blue Hill Observatory is home to the oldest continuously monitored meteorological records in North America, and its unique in the fact that the measurement site has changed very little since its foundation in 1885.
<p>Data gathering at this site was performed by National Weather Service personnel using the space (and utilities) provided by the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center until May of 1999. The NWS changed the nature of its presence at the site from that of NWS employees to a contract, and due to some facts that still apply today, the NWS asked Eastern Administrative Service Center (EASC) to enter into a sole source type of contract with the representatives of the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center.</p>
<p>In a letter dated January 29, 1999 Dr. William Minsinger, President of the Blue Hill Science Center expressed their uneasiness at the prospect of non-NWS personnel using their facilities. In other words, letting contract personnel with which they are not familiar with into their land, facilities, etc., was not an option they felt comfortable with. Because of this, in his letter Dr. Minsinger also indicated the willingness of the Science Center to obtain the contract themselves to take on the responsibilities of the observational work. These are some of the items, still relevant today, for pursuing a sole source contract with the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center as opposed to an " outsider" contract: <br />&bull; The Blue Hill Observatory Science center has a long term agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (owners of the building and former known as the Metropolitan District Commission) to provide all public programming in the newly renovated facility. This organization also provides the maintenance for the building and the grounds that surround it. <br />&bull; Access to and from the building where observations are taken is controlled by the Science Center, and have been provided freely until now. For contract personnel access to and from the Observatory would become an issue, including issuance of passes, badges, separate keys for those areas of the building we use, security, etc. <br />&bull; Another site is not acceptable as the whole purpose of this exercise is to maintain the 125 year record and its site intact. <br />&bull; The site has gone through renovations, and the Science Center Museum is now open. This observer on duty introduces climate measurement concepts to visitors to the Center. Anybody other than a NWS employee or observer provided by the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center is not acceptable.<br />&bull; The hiring of contract personnel will, by the very nature of the Observatory, necessitate that adequate training be provided by the NWS in the operation and maintenance of the unique equipment used at the site. <br />These issues became irrelevant in 1999, including that of training, as the Science Center identified an observer with over 40 years of experience at Blue Hill, and two more part time meteorologists as ready to maintain the observational work for them, if the contract was awarded to the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center.</p>
<p>Finally, and to quote Dr. Minsinger, "We are most willing to continue to support the current NWS observer with the current arrangement. However we feel that any other arrangement in which the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center could not directly participate in or indeed provide the observational work at the Observatory would prove entirely unsatisfactory." These feelings are still prevalent today.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the recommendation of the Eastern Region Headquarters that at this time the NWS enter once again into a sole source type of contract with the representatives of the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. March 29, 2010 will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the required analysis. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes, as part of a market survey led by the Navy Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons [PEO (U&W)].  It is NOT a Request for Proposals.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  

The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (DCNO) for Information Dominance (N2/N6) has identified a need for an aircraft carrier based aircraft system providing persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities that will enhance the versatility provided by an aircraft carrier.  Over the next ten years, Navy investment will focus on defining requirements and beginning development of an unmanned capability to achieve this enhanced versatility.  

The Navy is interested in information on carrier based, low observable (LO) Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) concepts optimized for Irregular and Hybrid Warfare scenarios, capable of integrating with manned platforms as part of the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) by the end of 2018 to support limited operations in contested scenarios.  The UAS should enhance situational awareness and shorten the time it takes to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess time sensitive targets.   This RFI is intended to determine the existence of sources that can provide a limited inventory of systems capable of being operated by fleet Sailors and performing the above mentioned Navy UAS mission.   

Attached to this announcement is a complete version of this RFI to include constraints, content of RFI responses, security and submission information, additional information, and points of contact.

The goal is to reduce direct and indirect purchase costs and to capture detailed spend data. Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas:
Buyers shall have the ability to set a target price, optionally set the criteria for selecting the winner (s), include DON terms and conditions, and set a specified start and end date of each auction.  At the end of the auction, the buyer shall have the option to select the winner(s) manually.
Suppliers shall be able to submit a successively lower bid than the target price and see whether their submitted bid is leading or lagging behind the lead bid.   Suppliers shall not have knowledge of the other bids posted or bidders participating in the auction to anonymously compete for a DON requirement.
Contractors who believe that they posses the expertise and experience to fulfill all of these requirements are invited to submit technical and management capabilities addressing each of these areas in writing. Interested contractors should also address whether they can fulfill the requirements via GSA schedules. Please send responses via e-mail to david.felling@navy.mil by close of business on 8 April 2010. Please limit your response to no more than five pages.

<DESC>New Requirement.&nbsp; Additional Sources sought.&nbsp; Up to 2 positions available.<br /><br />The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), located at SLAC, began operation last year as the world's first x-ray free-electron laser, producing ultra-fast pulses of coherent x-rays with unprecedented brightness. A suite of x-ray instruments for exploiting the unique LCLS scientific capabilities are being produced. This is a heterogeneous system comprised of VME and cPCI and ATCA single board computers running RTEMS and clusters of machines running Linux. Components to be controlled and readout are several different types of stepper motors (e.g. IMS smart motors), vacuum gauges with MKS controllers, Gamma ion-pump controllers, high-voltage via VME modules, low-voltage supplies, Automation Direct Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and several different types of CCD cameras. The components are connected either via terminal server serial port, Ethernet, or directly via plug-in cards in VME and cPCI crates or in PCI slots in linux servers. Control processes run on VME CPU modules running the RTEMS open-source real-time operation system, or cPCI and PCI servers running the Red-Hat linux operating system. For the controls the Experimental Physics and Industrial Controls System (EPICS) frame-work is used. User interface are GUI screens written in EDM or python/Qt.<br /><br />The contractor will work on the development, installation, debugging, commissioning, and maintenance of the above described controllers including hardware and software. The successful candidate will interact with scientists and engineers to get and keep the systems running and implement improvements.<br /><br /><br />This presolicitation does not obligate SLAC to fill these positions nor binds SLAC to provide an RFP or solicit or award a contract.

<DESC>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) intends to award a sole-source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) supplemental agreement to the SBSS maintenance and operations requirements contract (FA8819-08-C-0006) for all remaining pre-launch, launch, and post-launch tasks currently contracted for under the SBSS development contract (FA8819-04-C-0002). Activities include preparation for and execution of launch activities, execution of post launch through completion of on-orbit checkout, maintenance and storage of the system in near-launch-ready status, transportation of the system and system components to the launch site upon launch call-up, and mission assurance and risk reduction activities. These activities will be removed from the SBSS development contract upon incorporation of this work into the SBSS maintenance and operations requirements contract.
<p>The estimated period of performance for this work is June 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011. The period of performance may vary based on the actual launch date and completion of on-orbit checkout. The intended source for this effort is Boeing Company, 2600 Westminster Blvd, Seal Beach, CA 90470, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".<br />The Government believes Boeing is the only company capable of providing the services involved in the pre-launch, launch, and post-launch support of the SBSS Block 10. This effort is for the continued provisioning of highly specialized services. It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling Air Force requirements.<br />Any persons or companies interested may submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) containing the following information: Company name, address, primary POC including phone number, technical description of the offeror's experience, knowledge of Air Force Space Command space situational awareness (SSA), taskable space sensors and the associated Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and architecture, description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; and proof of security clearances for government evaluation. Interested parties must have experience with analysis of Air Force Space Command military systems and capabilities, to include development of software and associated software tools, and must have detailed knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, capabilities, and their operations across all SSA mission areas. All interested parties must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret - SCI accredited SCIF.<br />Responses to this synopsis should be submitted via email in electronic format MS Word 2000 or newer format, or PDF format and must conform to 8.5" X 11" page size, type 12 font, with a maximum of 20 total pages (11x17" foldouts with minimum 12 font are acceptable but will count as two pages). Send SOCs to attention: Roy Lee &amp; Jack May or e-mailed to roy.lee@losangeles.af.mil &amp; jack.may@losangeles.af.mil to be received by 5:00 P.M, PST, on 31 March 2010. Oral communications are not acceptable. Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact. No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 employees. Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOC's. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.

<CONTACT>JOAZ JOAZ, Contracting Officer, Fax 304-480-7203, Email psb2@bpd.treas.gov
<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center, Division of Procurement, intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to Bloomberg Financial L.P., 731 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10022 for the renewal of Bloomberg Online Financial Subscription Service, for a base and four (4) option years. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.
<p>The Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) is currently utilizing the Bloomberg Online Financial Subscription Service and is in need of the renewal of this service for 2010 in order to ensure continued performance. A sole source is intended for this order; no other source is known that is fully capable and available to provide the required services.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Online Financial Subscription Service is used by Treasury Auction participants, U.S. Treasury policymakers, and debt managers to access historical and prevailing data on U.S. Treasury securities, such as real-time pricing, issue information, and WI rates. The data provided by Bloomberg is proprietary data. It is absolutely critical that BPD have access to this specific service so that they may monitor and verify the information provided by Bloomberg to auction participants and to ensure the integrity and efficiency of the auction process. Bloomberg also provides news and historical data used by offices at BPD to analyze and monitor fixed-income markets. BPD's staff has been trained by Bloomberg personnel on the use of the Bloomberg terminal.</p>
<p>Interested respondents shall demonstrate the capability to provide the same level of service, including user training, in a manner as cost effective as renewing services with Bloomberg. BPD will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 10 days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show how it would be advantageous to the Government to switch providers for this requirement (i.e. software costs, training for employees, contingencies, professional environment, and Government securities regulations (GSRS)). A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available.</p>
<p>If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that it is more advantageous to the Government,&nbsp;BPD intends to negotiate a sole-source award to Bloomberg Financial.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intended period of performance for this requirement is 12 months from the date of award, plus four (4) option years.</p>
<p>Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. Responses to this request can be emailed to psb2@bpd.treas.gov - Attention: JOAZ .</p>

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7220-00-NIB-0367<br />Name: Disposable Urinal Floor Mat<br />Description: Charcoal colored mat designed to be used with all single, hanging urinals. Impregnated with pleasant "Fresh" scent to eliminate odors in the immediate area.</p>
<p>NSN: 7220-00-NIB-0368<br />Name: Disposable Toilet Floor Mat<br />Description: Disposable, Charcoal Black ,Restroom Mats designed to be used with the commode</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be GSA/Federal Acquisition Service, Southwest Supply Center, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7220-00-NIB-0367<br />Similar Items: BGD668HALFPK, IMP1525, 2LHJ9, WIZKID 000-1</p>
<p>NSN: 7220-00-NIB-0368<br />Similar Items: BGD667HALFPK, IMP1550, WIZKID 000-2</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 2, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>Proposer's Day Announcement<br />MOIRE - Membrane Optic Imager Real-Time Exploitation<br />Tactical Technology Office<br />Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a Proposers' Day in support of a planned Broad Agency Announcement (DARPA BAA 10-51) for a new program to develop a large, diffractive optics membrane and associated deployment and support structures, and communications equipment for use in a geosynchronous orbit-based telescope. The MOIRE Proposer's Day will be held 0730 -1700 EST on April 8, 2010, at the Westfields Washington Dulles Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and program planning purposes. The Proposers' Day is intended to introduce the research and development community to the program vision, goals and objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of interdisciplinary teams to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The Proposer's Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.</p>
<p>The objective of the MOIRE program is to provide persistent, real-time, tactical video to the war fighter. Development of diffractive membrane optics may facilitate low-cost geosynchronous imaging. A 10-meter diffractive membrane is currently envisioned for a Phase III flight demonstration. All designs must be traceable to an operational 20-meter system providing 24/7 visible NIIRS 3.5+ coverage over denied areas with at least a 1 Hz rate, FOV &gt; 100 km^2, field of regard &gt; 10^8 km^2 with a designed cost not to exceed $500M a copy after initial NRE. This set of requirements is referred to as the operational Design Reference Mission (DRM).</p>
<p>Upon release of the BAA, DARPA will seek complete balanced innovative system-oriented proposals that address all the following important technical factors: <br />[1] Large low cost, lightweight, deployable, diffractive membrane optics for geosynchronous orbit imaging systems.<br />[2] Near real time image stabilization and tactical geolocation knowledge<br />[3] A telescope design that increases spectral bandwidth<br />[4] Stability and dynamics of the large structure in geosynchronous orbit<br />[5] Target motion detection capability for highway speeds</p>
<p>To facilitate maximum participation DARPA will host a MOIRE Proposers' Day that will: (a) Introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the program vision and objectives; (b) Explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this potential effort; and (c) Promote teaming arrangements among organizations having relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to execute an interdisciplinary research program responsive to the program goals. The Proposer's Day will include overview presentations by Government personnel in the morning and 10-15 minute one (organization)-on-one sessions with the Program Manager in the afternoon. Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas is critical.</p>
<p>Registration is limited by the venue capacity. To maximize the number of organizations participating, there is a limit of five persons per organization (not per division). Early registration is strongly recommended. The registration cutoff date is 11:00 AM ET, April 5, 2010.</p>
<p>The registration website is www.schafertmd.com/conference/moire. Details including registration, agenda, meeting location, meals, parking and lodging will be provided on the registration website.</p>
<p>MOIRE Proposer's Day Details:</p>
<p>Time: April 8, 2010, 7:30am-5:00pm<br />Location: Westfields Washington Dulles Marriott<br />14750 Conference Center Drive<br />Chantilly, Virginia 20151</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY   TAS::14 1035::TAS RECOVERY CRMO PMIS 129834  The National Park Service intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract to C-2 Construction, 805 So. 18th West, Suite 100, Mountain Home, Idaho 83647 for construction of a trail connecting the existing camping area to the visitor's center at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (CRMO) near Arco, Idaho 83213. This project will be partially or wholly funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the contractor must meet all reporting requirements of ARRA as described in FAR 52.204-11 (MAR 2010 Deviation), Section 1512 of ARRA, and other reports as required by law or regulation, additional information may also be found at www.federalreporting.gov
The acquisition has been offered to the U.S. Small Business Administration under the 8(a) Program and will be negotiated and awarded to C-2 Construction as a non-competitive award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, FAR Part 19.8.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to this project is 237990 Trails Construction with a corresponding small business size standard of $33.5M. The magnitude of this construction project is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000. Final acceptance by the SBA Boise District Office is pending; however, no changes are expected from what has been proposed. This is not a request for competitive proposals and is published for the purpose of providing public notification.  
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS SOLE SOURCE ACTION
1.	 Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity: Department of Interior, National Park Service, Pacific West Region, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, action awarded through North Cascades National Park, Sedro-Woolley, WA 98284.
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: The National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract for trail construction in accordance with FAR 19.8 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (5) to C-2 Construction of Mountain Home, Idaho. 
3.	A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: Construction of an ADA accessible concrete trail between the existing camping area and the visitor's center at CRMO near Arco, Idaho. The estimated magnitude of the construction project is between $100,000 and $250,000.
4.	An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (5) and FAR 19.8, the U.S. Small Business Administration 8a small and disadvantaged business program.
5.	A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: C-2 Construction is a Small Business Administration certified small and disadvantaged business.  C-2 has extensive construction experience at CRMO.  C-2 recently received an award for construction of a fire protection system at CRMO.  C-2 Construction submitted the lowest price among five competing offers and will be performing this contract on-site in the next several months.  Access to utilities, such as water and power, is logistically limited at CRMO and having multiple contractors competing for limited access to resources will increase costs and promote inefficiency.  Award of this contract will improve job-site efficiency and also save mobilization costs as C-2 Construction will already have supervision, equipment, tools, and other resources on-site.
6.	A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies: Soliciting a single offer from a SBA certified small disadvantaged business is authorized through the SBA 8a Program at this dollar threshold. A synopsis for SBA approved 8a actions at this dollar threshold is normally not required.  This ARRA funded action is synopsized to promote maximum transparency of expenditure of ARRA funds.
7.	A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: C-2 Construction has a long history of cost efficient and satisfactory performance at CRMO.  C-2 Construction recently submitted the lowest price offer among five competing proposals, and was subsequently awarded the contract, for construction of fire detection at CRMO.  NPS utilizes Architects and Engineers to develop and estimate construction costs prior to solicitation issuance and negotiation of the final contract amount to insure fair and reasonable pricing.
8.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was conducted by the Contracting Officer at North Cascades National Park and by the Facilities Manager at CRMO to verify the aforementioned factors are accurate. 
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples): N/A
10.	 A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A
11.	 A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome    Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required: Award of this action is in accordance with all laws and within all guidelines of Federal Acquisition Regulations and based upon the aforementioned factors is in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC><br />DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Coast Guard Base Support Unit Miami Office of Procurement intends TO PROCURE CONTRACTOR SERVICES TO REPAIR GROVE CRANE MODEL#RT58D. THE PURPOSE OF THE REPAIR IS TO ADDRESS DISCREPANCIES FOUND DURING THE ANNUAL SAFETY INSPECTION AND LOAD TESTS. IN ORDER FOR THE CRANE TO MAINTAIN ITS OPERATIONAL STATUS, THE CRANE MUST PASS THE INSPECTIONS TO MAINTAIN THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION. THIS EQUIPMENT IS A MISSION CRITICAL ITEM WHICH IS USED ON A DAILY BASIS TO SERVICE COAST GUARD VESSELS, DURING DOCKSIDE WORK ORDERS AND CASUALTY REPORTS (CASREPS). THESE REPAIRS MUST BEGIN IMMEDIATELY. THE SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED ARE THE FOLLOWING:<br /><br />1. REPOSITION PINS ON SHEAVES FOR EXTENDING WIRE ROPE<br />2. REPLACE WIRE ROPES PER OEM SPECS. (GROVE MOBILE CRANE)<br />3. REMOVE REPLACE ROD AND REINSTALL THE LEFT SIDE AXEL LOCK OUT CYLINDER. (ROD IS PITTED)<br />4. REMOVE BOOM CYLINDERS AND REPLACE RODS, REINSTALL CYLINDERS.

<p>NOTE 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies AND services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with RING POWER CRANE under the authority of FAR 6.302. MARKET RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED WITH SEVERAL CRANE MAINTENANCE COMPANIES TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL SOURCES. RING POWER CRANE WAS THE ONLY COMPANY SURVEYED THAT HAS ACCESS TO GROVE SERVICE BULLETINS AND SPECIFICATIONS. A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION WOULD ADD SIGNIFICANT DELAYS AS THE PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS WOULD HAVE TO BE FAMILIARIZED WITH THE CRANE OR SURVEY THE NEEDED REPAIRS WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE CRANE BEING TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AND THE UNIT UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS MISSION. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this <br />procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) supports the development of nanotechnology through research on measurement and fabrication methods, standards and technology, and by operating a nanofabrication facility.</p>
<p>The CNST requires a hydrofluoric acid vapor etching system (HFVE) to etch silicon dioxide on wafers and chips for nanofabrication applications. All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation with consideration to all of the minimum specifications as follows:</p>
<p>A. The HFVE system must use hydrofluoric acid (HF) vapor to etch silicon dioxide. The liquid HF used to generate the vapor must be able to be 49% HF or a mixture of 49% HF and organic solvents;</p>
<p>B. The HFVE system must be able to etch wafers with a diameter of 75 mm, 100 mm and 150 mm diameter, as well as chips as small as 5 mm;</p>
<p>C. The silicon dioxide etch rate must cover the range from 4 micrometers/hour to 25 micrometers/hour;</p>
<p>D. The HFVE system must consist of a reaction chamber, a heated wafer/chip holder, an HF storage container and temperature control unit. The expected process will be as follows:</p>
<p>a. The wafer/chip is loaded onto the holder.</p>
<p>b. The wafer/chip holder is loaded onto the reaction chamber.</p>
<p>c. The holder is heated to the desired temperature.</p>
<p>d. HF is transferred from the storage container into the reaction chamber.</p>
<p>e. The etching proceeds.</p>
<p>E. The HFVE system must be designed to work within an acid fume hood and have a volume smaller than 600 mm length x 450 mm depth x 400 mm height;</p>
<p>F. The temperature of the wafer/chip holder must be controlled by an electronics module that can achieve at least 1 degree Celsius resolution and can operate between room temperature and 60 degrees Celsius;</p>
<p>G. The temperature control module must be able to sit outside of the acid fume hood and therefore should have cables that are sufficiently long;</p>
<p>H. As a measure of etching uniformity, the standard deviation of the etched material must be no greater than 30% of the amount of material etched. For example, if 1 micrometer is etched, the standard deviation across the wafer must be no greater than 300 nm (quotation must provide data to satisfy this specification);</p>
<p>I. Wafers must be held by a clamping ring that protects the back side of the wafer and blocks no more than 5 mm from the edge of the front side of the wafer;</p>
<p>J. An electrostatic clamping holder must be provided to hold small chips and odd-sized parts; and</p>
<p>K. The HF container must hold at least 200 mL.</p>
<p>Although not required as minimum specifications, the following will be considered advantageous upon consideration of all quotations submitted:</p>
<p>A. Better etching uniformity than listed above, and</p>
<p>B. The ability to pump-out the reaction chamber and purge with nitrogen. The exhaust will be plumbed to the ventilation exit of the acid fume hood.</p>
<p>DELIVERY<br />Delivery must be completed no later than 60 days after receipt of order. All line items shall be delivered to NIST, ATTN: Shipping and Receiving, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899.</p>
<p>Delivery term shall be FOB Destination regardless of prepaid freight. The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.<br /><br />FINAL ACCEPTANCE <br />Final acceptance shall be provided and payment in full shall be made upon receipt and acceptance of all line items.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD<br />Award will be made on a technically acceptable/best value basis. Technically acceptable means that all of the minimum technical specifications are met as required by this solicitation. Of the technically acceptable quotations, overall value, not necessarily relating only to price, shall be the determining factor.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone: (2) 372-3692 or Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received via email to Ms. Tamara Mason, Contract Specialist, at Tamara.M.Mason@uscg.mil, by 12:00 noon, Eastern Time, on 2 April 2010. Quotes received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Any formal questions resulting from the site visit or questions for clarification concerning this solicitation shall be submitted via email to the Contract Specialist, Tamara Mason, at Tamara.M.Mason@uscg.mil no later than 12:00 noon, Eastern Time, on 29 March 2010.</p>

The following Statement/Information is in reference to this Acquisition being considered to be a Sole Source Acquisition based on the following as provided to the Contracting Officer and hereby agreed upon.  

USCG C2CEN SEAWATCH FRC LAB SOFTWARE PURCHASE
Justification for other than full and open competition


USCG C2CEN SEAWATCH FRC
 SOFTWARE PURCHASE
Justification for other than full and open competition.
(a) Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information: 
(1)Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." 
 United States Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), Portsmouth Virginia

(2)Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 

SEAWATCH Fast Response Cutter (FRC) requires four software applications produced by SSR Engineering for use in development of the command and control system.

(3)A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. 
The SEAWATCH FRC requires four software applications designed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), SSR Engineering.  These software applications include:

Radar Display Operator Position RDOP/C-ARPA Radar Software for Windows (P/N 700) 
Camera Manager Software for Solaris (P/N 642-CM4)
Automated Information System (AIS) Parser with Blue Force Tracking Software (P/N 310-BF)
Composite Tracker Software (P/N 600)

(4)An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
6.302-1 (2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.

(5)A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
The use of the Personal Computer Radar Processor (PCRP) from SSR Engineering has been dictated by the FRC Circular of Requirements (COR) and in order to interface properly with this equipment certain software applications need to be running in SEAWATCH.

(6)A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
Requirement shall be posted on FedBizOpps as brand specific.  This posting will include verbage that any Offeror that feels that they can provide Items that meet this requirement as stated may provide a quotation, and all offers will be considered by the Government. 

(7)A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
These software applications are Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) products that fit seamlessly into the design of the system.  They require no further modifications to interface with the PCRP and fully meet our requirements as built.  Therefore, we would not need to pay for the cost of either developing an application or modifying another application to interface with the PCRP. The anticipated purchase cost will be the same that the General Public would pay for the same identical item. 

(8)A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  
We have performed Market Research and found other products that perform similar functions to the applications requested, however, they would need to be Modified to meet the interface requirements for the PCRP.  The COTS applications built by SSR Engineering does not need to be modified because they already interface with the PCRP and that would cut the cost of hiring someone else to modify their COTS product to interface with the PCRP.

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
The PCRP is part of the C4ISR developed by prime contractor for the FRC.  The protocol that the PCRP communicates in is Common Radar Information Communication (COMRIC) which was developed by SSR Engineering.  In order to properly interface with the PCPR, which will be installed on the FRC as per the COR section 451-3, SEAWATCH requires the use of these 3 particular software applications to bring in radar and track data in order to fulfill Coast Guard-7 (CG-7) requirements.  These applications understand COMRIC data formats and will be able to seamlessly bring in the required data that is needed by SEAWATCH.
  
(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
None

(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 
Ongoing Market Research shall be conducted for future requirements.   The hardware requirements in the FRC COR specify the use of a PCRP for radar data and SEAWATCH must interface with this equipment.  Therefore, we need software applications to interface.

(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. 
(a)  The requirement to interface with a PCRP is valid.  In order to interface with a PCRP SEAWATCH needs certain software applications developed by SSR Engineering, the same company that builds the PCRP in order to fully meet the interface requirements.

 (b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel. 
C2CEN is developing SEAWATCH FRC for delivery as Government Furnished Information to the FRC prime contractor.  The FRC COR Section 451-3 specifies the use of the PCRP for use in the FRC radar design.  This particular piece of hardware is made by SSR Engineering.  In order for SEAWATCH to properly interface with this hardware to receive radar picture and track information, it needs to be running certain software applications that are only developed by SSR Engineering.  Normally, these software applications are residing on SSR Engineering equipment, however, in the case of the FRC they will not be.  Therefore, they need to be running on SEAWATCH.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

As a force provider, ACC organizes, trains, equips, and maintains combat-ready forces for rapid deployment and employment while ensuring strategic air defense forces are ready to meet the challenges of peace and wartime air sovereignty and air defense missions.

<DESC>Government Response to contractors question

1. After reading and rereading the SOW it remains unclear to me the DOJ preferred method d of pricing. Is the DOJ looking for and hourly rate per task or a flat rate per task or some other method?

2. No where in the SOW or in the accompanying Excel spread sheet are the number of network drops per office defined. Is that information available?

Response: At minimum, each office will have two (2) data drops.  Specific requirements are identified by local USAO personnel and submitted to EOUSA after the project is approved.  


3. This is a very large requirement for a small business will DOJ consider dividing the requirement into geographical regions?


Response: The Program Management team must be based in Washington, DC.  EOUSA is interested in options available to address the nationwide cable project requirement.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses posed by potential offerors.

NIST will provide any necessary 1 GB switches. NIST will handle the integration of the cluster into the surrounding infrastructure.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:<br /></span>What processor speed do you want in the dual quad core processors? Will any be acceptable as long as they have two Xeons?<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response:</span><br />Any speed as long as we get eight cores per blade. Since power consumption is a concern, it may even be better to run the slower clock rate. More blades at 2.26 GHz will be considered better than fewer blades at 2.66 GHz or 2.93 GHz.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:<br /></span>How did you want the 24GB RAM configured? 12x2 GB, or 6x4GB? Apple branded RAM only or third party OK?<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response:<br /></span>Quality third party RAM is perfectly acceptable. Bear in mind that you will be warranting the cluster, so please choose carefully from sources known to be reliable. Also, the 12x2 GB will be perfectly acceptable.

Quality third party SSDs are also acceptable. We will consider the performance specifications of the SSD with a minimum of 128 GB storage in regards to random I/O, and rewrite lifetime and price in evaluating the proposals.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:<br /></span>Apple doesn't carry the 40-Gigabit Infiniband HCA Adapter Card so please do let us know what exactly we have to quote and configure.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response:</span><br />The 40-Gigabit Infiniband HCA Adapter Card does not have to be an Apple product.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>**************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Purchase Request Number: F3W4010071AQ01 Request for Proposal. This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.</p>
<p>**************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil)</p>
<p>52.212-1 - INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror meets the performance and technical capability<br />requirements defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>A copy of the company's business license(s) and a narrative summarizing the company's experience with similar work are required to be submitted with the proposal. The narrative must include statement of understanding regarding the Government's requirement to be provided with the HVAC and electrical certificates for technicians prior to the performance of such work. Also, one of the following documents are required: a Meisterbrief or an ISO 9001 or 9002 certificate. Proposal must be submitted on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>2) Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest 5 proposals) against the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>--Business License(s): Business licenses submitted will be evaluated to determine if the contractor has authority to perform in Germany.</p>
<p>--A Meisterbrief or an ISO 9001 or 9002 certificate: Documentation will be reviewed to determine relevant experience.</p>
<p>--A narrative summarizing company's experience with similar work. Narrative must include statement of understanding regarding the Government's requirement to be provided with the HVAC and electrical certificates for technicians prior to the performance of such work. Documentation will be reviewed to determine relevant experience.</p>
<p>3) By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>4) Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding<br />contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of clause)</p>

An evaluation of the Vendors' price quotes will be made to determine if they are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the technical quote.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone: (2) 372-3692 or Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received via email to Ms. Tamara Mason, Contract Specialist, at Tamara.M.Mason@uscg.mil, by 12:00 noon, Eastern Time, on 2 April 2010. Quotes received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Any formal questions resulting from the site visit or questions for clarification concerning this solicitation shall be submitted via email to the Contract Specialist, Tamara Mason, at Tamara.M.Mason@uscg.mil no later than 12:00 noon, Eastern Time, on 29 March 2010.</p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS RECEIVED, with RESPONSE.

QUESTION 1  The info states on page 3 of 3 under point B "Material Specifications" that "It (corrocote) is to be applied to both the outside and the inside of the pole?" I have been unable to find anyone that will corrocote on the inside of the pole. United Galvanizing (whom we normally use for galvanizing and corrocote) will do this, but only for poles with a base OD of 19" or more. None of these poles have a base OD large enough to corrocote the inside of the poles. United Galvanizing claims that no one can corrocote the inside the inside of small poles. I've checked with 2 other galvanizers and they confirmed that small poles cannot have corrocote inside. 
The questions are: Is it necessary to corrocoate inside the poles?
RESPONSE:   YES 
If so, have they ever received poles that were corrocoted on the inside?
RESPONSE:  YES
If so, can they tell us who is able to do this so that we can get it done? 
RESPONSE:  Valmont Coatings

QUESTION 2  The info on Page 2 of 2 under point B "Material Specifications" states "the poles must be circular in cross section". 
By this, do they mean that the poles MUST BE round?  
RESPONSE:  YES
Or, can they be 12-sided and still meet this "circular in cross section" criteria?
RESPONSE:   NO

<DESC>AMENDED TO ISSUE AN AMENDED RFP, POST QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, POST Pre-Proposal Conference Slides and Attendance List.<br /><br />The proposal due date has not been extended.<br /><br />AMENDED TO&nbsp;ISSUE THE FINAL RFP.<br /><br />AMENDED TO INCLUDE NOTICE THAT THERE&nbsp;IS A PREPROPOSAL CONFERENCE FOR THIS EFFORT&nbsp;ON MARCH 16, 2010&nbsp;as noted in Section L.<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for providing security and law enforcement services for federal facilities. <br />The ICE Office of Acquisition (OAQ) plans to offer a requirement for a Computer Aided Dispatch Information System (CADIS) in support of the FPS Law Enforcement Mission.<br />To eliminate current functionality gaps and to address new law enforcement requirements a new system is needed that will automate core FPS law enforcement business processes and will result in a more standardized, integrated, and efficient national information technology solution for FPS. The system must provide a level of scalability and compatibility with other DHS, ICE, and FPS systems and shall always be in compliance with emerging DHS enterprise architecture. Further, the system must reflect the seamless integration of the following three functional components. <br />1) Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System for personnel dispatching in response to incidents.<br />2) Record Management System (RMS) to collect, share, and report incident information based on National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) standards. A system to conduct efficient call center management, which includes automated data collection, calls routing, viewing call history, etc.<br />3) Geographic Information System (GIS) to provide location information to assess dangerous sites, improving routing, vehicle tracking and to display other relevant neighborhood information.
<p>Furthermore, the proposed CADIS must replace the current Daily Operations Log (DOL) and Web Records Management System (WebRMS). <br />CADIS shall have the capability to collect, modify, store, retrieve, and process record management and geographic information data via a report management function and a record management system. CADIS will improve FPS Officer Safety, as the current manual processes will be automated; reducing the chances of critical errors by removing the extensive liability that currently exists with the dispatchers. Additionally, CADIS will provide intelligent resources in reporting information that is needed to make knowledgeable business decisions and aid in criminal analysis, helping FPS' efforts in providing preventative security measures. <br />Specifically, the system shall:<br />&bull; Be fully National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) compliant<br />&bull; Implement a system availability of 99.999 percent when measured on a 24-hour per day, seven day a week basis for 365 days. Processor, disk storage, and power supply redundancy may be required in order to achieve the desired availability and protection of information. The system shall be configured such that operating a training component and/or running reports will not affect system response time.<br />&bull; Interface with external applications and data sources.<br />&bull; Have the ability to push the client application via the DHS network to desktops and Mobile Computing Devices (MCD) via the internal network.<br />&bull; Allow a user the ability to access the application, download appropriate information and forms relating to incidents, and submit the necessary information without re-keying information. <br />&bull; Allow the capability to be directly expandable by adding hardware and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) modules. <br />&bull; Include a feature for backup, archival and recovery capability without taking CADIS out of service and with minimal impact on dispatch operations. <br />&bull; Provide the capability for users to work offline in the event of connectivity failures, and the capability to continue to work off-line in the event the failure occurs in the middle of a session without any data loss, and to upload saved offline data when connectivity is re-established.<br />&bull; Contain data exporting capabilities. CADIS must have the capability to export data in industry standard database formats to facilitate providing data to other databases controlled by DHS and/or other government entities. <br />&bull; Be able to generate standard automated forms and templates to be used by all regions; such as incident report, spot report, etc.<br />&bull; Contain a wide variety of reports and statistical information for analysis and management reporting and/or reporting requirements in real time. <br />&bull; Allow ad-hoc, dynamically generated reports such that code modifications are not required for each new report.</p>
<p>It is the intent of FPS to adapt to the current industry best practices as it relates to the FPS operating procedures and the operating environment of CADIS. Implementing CADIS will enable key FPS stakeholders the opportunity to assess current operating procedures against any productivity gains that can be realized through the introduction of automation. Consequently, neither a blanket "technology driving the process," nor a "process driving the technology" approach will be embraced, but a balanced approach that seriously evaluates the cost/benefit trade-off in moving from current to new operating procedures.</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;a full and open competition&nbsp;with proposals due <strong>APRIL 8, 2010</strong>.</p>

<p>The NIAID provides immunological and virological support for nonhuman primate studies conducted at NIAID's Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit contract sites (SVEUs) and by AIDS vaccine researchers through three Nonhuman Primate Immunology and Virology Laboratories for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development, previously called the NHP "Core Laboratories." The objective of the Core Laboratories has been to insure standardization and comparability of the assays conducted for preclinical NHP studies and to provide a common basis for assessment of the immunogenicity and efficacy of candidate HIV and SIV vaccines. The current contract for this work Contract No. N01-AI-30057, is entitled "Primate Core Immunology - Virology Laboratories, Part C: Quantitative Viral RNA Laboratory" with Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed contract is to provide a nonhuman primate virology laboratory that will conduct quantitative viral RNA measurements in support of studies that evaluate prototype AIDS vaccines in nonhuman primates. The contract will support the conduct, improvement, and development of assays designed to measure viral RNA loads in nonhuman primates that have been immunized with candidate HIV or SIV vaccines and challenged with SIV or SHIV in studies conducted at DAIDS Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit contract sites or by NIH-supported investigators.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use state-of the-art technologies to accomplish the contract objectives and shall incorporate new and improved technologies into contract activities when appropriate. The Contractor shall focus on the development, optimization, and conduct of assays to detect and assess antiviral neutralizing antibodies from immunized and infected animals. The Contractor shall use GLP processes to conduct assays when assessing humoral immune responses in NHP studies conducted with human clinical candidate AIDS vaccines.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a 1-year Base period plus six 1-year options for a possible total period of performance of 7 years beginning on or about March 30, 2011. The performance requirement will be for the delivery of 2.04 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and option periods (Years 2 through 7), which may be unilaterally exercised by the Government.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options to accommodate significant increases in work to be provided for the base period and option periods. Should the Government elect to exercise&nbsp;these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by .35 FTE for each option exercised. The Government may exercise an option up to three times in any year of the contract.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about April 2, 2010, and may be accessed through&nbsp;the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract</a> and through&nbsp;FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>Premier Data Services has been awarded the subject requirement.  Below is a description of that requirement.
The BLM maintains thousands of historic vital records of public land ownership in California. These records contain copies of original documents that have been microfilmed and are currently stored as a collection of microfilm aperture cards referred to as the Control Document Index (CDI). The BLM, California State Office has only one set of these aging microfilm aperture cards that are cumbersome to research and are not backed up in a digital format. The cards contain images of records that date back to the mid-1800s and include copies of patents and deeds that convey title of public lands to and from the United States. 
The purpose of this project is to scan up to 600,000 land status records from these micro-graphic copies of legal documents mounted on aperture cards. These records are within 4,850 Public Land Survey System (PLSS) townships and include townships identified as having existing or renewable energy applications/authorizations. This project will enable the BLM to more efficiently evaluate right of way applications and permits for renewable energy or other projects in a more efficient and timely manner; thereby saving the public and the BLM time in the land use application process.

<AWARDEE>Actigraph LLC  DUNS# 144830952, 15 W. Main Street, Pensacola, FL 325025927 US
<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide accelerometer-based activity monitors for researchers participating in the Biomarker-Based Validation of Diet and Physical Activity Assessment Tools in Existing Cohorts. <br /><br />Accelerometers are an accepted objective measure of physical activity, and are an essential element of the proposed research.  The validation study requires detailed movement information to characterize the physical activity patterns of study participants for comparison with self-reported information and with activity energy expenditure calculated from doubly labeled water and resting metabolic rate measures. The current state of the physical activity field is that the best information would include triaxial acceleration information captured in high resolution (e.g., epoch length of 10 sec or less), step count data, and information about postural position.<br /><br />The contractor shall provide:<br />1)	400 Actigraph GT3X with expanded memory physical activity monitors<br />2)	8 7-port USB hub with cables<br />3)	4 ActiLife Software for device initialization and data download
<p>Salient characteristics of the Actigraph GT3X with expanded memory physical activity monitors include:<br />1.)	Triaxial acceleration information captured in high resolution (which allows evaluation of orientation), <br />2.)	Capability for &lt; 10 second epoch length, and sufficient memory and battery for at least 7 days. <br />3.)	Step count data<br />4.)	Availability of information about postural position</p>
<p>1)  The first delivery of 175 devices shall be delivered by March 26, 2010 to:<br />2)  The second delivery of 175 devices shall be delivered by April 8, 2010 to:<br />3)  The third delivery of 1,050 devices shall be delivered by July 30, 2010.</p>
<p>The Actigraph GT3X with expanded memory allows capture and storage of a week of triaxial acceleration data at one second resolution in addition to step count and postural orientation data.  This is necessary to support the precise physical activity measurements required for the research to be supported.  These capabilities are not found in other known physical activity monitors.<br />The Actigraph GT3X is the only known established monitor that meets the requirements noted above and Actigraph L.L.C. is the only known provider of the monitor and its related software.</p>

<AWARDEE>Lockheed Martin Corp., Simulation, Training and Support, 12506 Lake Underhill Road
, Orlando, FL 32825-5002 US
<DESC>Lockheed Martin Corp., Simulation, Training and Support, Orlando, Fla., is being awarded an $83,305,442 cost-plus-incentive-fee contract to design, develop, fabricate, integrate, and test the electronic Consolidated Automated Support System. In addition, this provides for the procurement of 14 engineering development models (EDMs)during the system design and development phase(SDD) of the contract. The development path goal for eCASS is to develop a capability to utilize the Navys approximately 700 Test program Sets (TPS) currently in use. To attempt to achieve that goal, under the contract the contractor will be required to successfully demonstrate a certain number of TPS on the system to be developed. The development of the EDMs and the TPS sets will likely require a significant amount of re-work by the eventual contractor in order to work out the integration and compatibility issues that will inevitably result from the process of converting CASS TPS sets to operate on the eCASS system. Given this development process and the resultant degree of risk, a fixed price contract approach was determined insufficient to elicit industry participation in the acquisition. The use of Cost Plus Incentive Fee as the contract type for SDD appropriately allocates the cost growth risk to the Government. To help motivate industry to constrain costs, a share ratio of 70/30 Government /contractor was utilized. Work will be performed in Orlando, Fla. (61 percent); Hunt Valley, Md. (26 percent); North Reading, Mass.(12 percent); and Reston, Va. (1 percent), and is expected to be completed in March 2015. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured via an electronic request for proposals; three offers were received. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, N.J., is the contracting activity (N68335-10-C-0225).

<DESC>Sole Source Justification 

The DeltaVision system is a very sophisticated piece of equipment that enables investigators to make observations that cannot be made by conventional fluorescence microscopy.  It is very important to maximize the use of this expensive piece of equipment as the number of investigators who use it has increased steadily.  In addition to the increase in users, this system is being used for more sophisticated types of experiments like multi-point long-term time lapse.  A service contract is required to reduce downtime and allow users access to new software upgrades.  Replacement parts and repairs are prohibitively expensive without a pre-arranged service contract.  Applied Precision equipment must be repaired, calibrated and cleaned by certified Applied Precision technicians.  No other company can provide Applied Precision certified service and parts.
