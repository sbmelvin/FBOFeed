<SUBJECT>B--The Archaeological and Biological Analysis of World War II Shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico: A Pilot Study of the Artificial Reef Effect in Deepwater
<SOLNBR>0103RP73095
<RESPDATE>070803
<ARCHDATE>06102004
<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement (0103RP73095) solicits sources for a study in specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Environmental Studies Program, relative to artificial reef effects in deep water.  BACKGROUND:  The Minerals Management Service hereby solicits, in cooperation with the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP), research proposals pursuing the goal and purpose of the Partnership Program outlined in Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201.  The central focus of the Partnership Program is an integrated and sustained ocean observation system achieved by a federation of many elements to support a wide range of users. The following five Investment Areas form the basis of the NOPP Investment Portfolio:  A) Operational/Routine Observations (including pilots, testbeds, etc.); B) Research "Observatories" (long-term experiments and data series, etc.); C) Observational Technique Development (sensors and platforms); D) "Commons" for Ocean Information ("hubs" and "nodes", etc.); E) Outreach/Education.  This solicitation specifically addresses two (2) of these areas; the Operational/ Routine Observations (Topic A) and the Outreach/Education (Topic E) Investment Areas.  Partnership proposals shall be sought to investigate up to eight (8) shipwrecks dating from the World War II era in primarily deep water, which is here defined as anything deeper than 300 feet.  Oil industry surveys have located each of these wrecks and MMS presumes a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the positions as they have been reported.  OBJECTIVES:  The archaeological objective of this study is to ground-truth, document, positively identify, and assess the National Register status of these wrecks.  This objective will require both historical research and field investigation to be conducted for each site.  Several of the vessels are attributed solely based on their location relative to their reported position of loss.  Others have been positively identified by means of videography acquired by the oil industry.  Copies of these tapes will be made available to the contractor by the MMS for purposes of their pre-dive planning.  The biological component of this study is intended to approach one basic question: do man-made artificial structures or objects, i.e., shipwrecks, function as artificial reefs in deep water?  Although there is not yet a complete understanding of how artificial reefs function on the continental shelf, particularly in the photic zone above 100 m, it is generally accepted that artificial reefs can serve a positive function by the creation of new hard bottom habitat in areas where hard bottom is naturally lacking (most of the Gulf of Mexico).  In the case of fish, artificial reefs can act both as attraction devices and as new habitat where new fish biomass is created and exported, meaning production.  The fouling community growing on new hard bottom provided by artificial substrate is unquestionably new production for those organisms that require hard substrate. Although artificial structures alone do not add food or nutrients to the marine environment, the biofouling community may be very efficient in stripping both nutrients and suspended material from passing water and plankton and building a high standing stock community. The trophic linkages between the flux of organic material to deepwater fouling communities and potentially related fish communities have not been investigated.  THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE of the resultant contract will be twenty-four (24) months, with an estimated cost of $300,000 - $350,000.  Up to eighteen (18) days of ship time aboard NOAA research vessels, operating personnel, and a remotely operated vehicle will be made available to the successful Offeror(s) in FY 2004 by the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration at no cost, subject to appropriation and final approval by the National Ocean Research Leadership Council.  TO VIEW THE DETAILED STATEMENT OF WORK and the required deliverables and schedule, send an email request to richard.bolick@mms.gov and reference Solicitation Number 0103RP73095. IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT, Offerors must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 3:00PM EDT, July 8, 2003, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail: (A) Your key personnel, scientific and technical (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project), with their qualifications and specific expertise and experience.

The software and hardware to be maintained are located in Reston, Virginia and Denver, Colorado, Menlo Park, California, and Rolla, Missouri. The Contractor is required to provide maintenance and source revision updates for the Intergraph Commercial Off the Shelf Software packages.  Maintenance will be required on newer photogrammetric workstations and associated software, and on aging photogrammetric scanners with associated custom-developed software.

The anticipated period of performance for this contract will be a base year with four option years.  Potential sources for the required hardware and/or software maintenance services are invited to provide an affirmative response within 10 days of the publication date of this notice. The anticipated date of award is 9/1/03.  Interested parties may respond with information on capabilities for both hardware and software maintenance or they may respond with only the capabilities for only hardware or the software. Responses should include full technical information on the vendor in such detail to enable the Government to confirm the submitter's capabilities to maintain the hardware and/or software. All responses will be evaluated in order to determine whether that firm has full knowledge of the USGS's requirement for maintenance of existing hardware and software in accordance with the above mandatory requirements. An affirmative response shall include literature, brochures, and other such information corresponding to the required items that demonstrates the capabilities of the offeror's services. All responses must be in writing; no telephone responses will be accepted. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; NO COMPETITIVE RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE. Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP), replacing RFP 263-03-P-001, to implement the program described below. The new Agricultural Exports and Rural Incomes (AERI) project is designed to address three key socio-economic problems in Egypt: high unemployment, low rural income and underdeveloped agricultural export potential. The goal of AERI is to increase rural incomes and on-farm and agro-business jobs. Its purpose is to strengthen the competitiveness of Egypt’s agriculture in a global economy by expanding access of Egypt’s farmers and agribusiness firms to the knowledge, technology, markets and institutions that are key elements for success.
 
Interventions under AERI will emphasize: 1)Increasing agricultural incomes to stimulate increased rural non-farm employment, especially in Upper Egypt; 2)Improving the productivity and competitiveness of smallholders to achieve increased incomes; 3)Broadening horticultural development efforts to diversify crops and markets, enhance the role of small growers as suppliers to exporters, integrate the fresh and processed segments of the industry, and expand the use of good agricultural practices in domestic horticulture; 4)Improving the smallholder livestock sector as a means to increase agricultural incomes, especially for women who dominate this sector and 5) Bringing about world-class research and training that is more responsive to private sector needs.  AERI’s goal and purpose will be achieved through five activities. 
 
Activities three and four will be implemented through two grants and a cooperative agreement to be awarded by USAID in the near future. This RFP pertains specifically to three out of AERI’s five activities as follows: Activity One: Sub-grants for smallholder groups (this activity replaces the original AERI activity 1 focusing on Policy); Activity Two: Technical Support to Agriculture-based Trade Associations; Activity Five: Legacy Program Design. One direct contract will be awarded for implementation of these three activities. Implementation under the contract will occur over two years with two option periods (the first option period will be one year and the second will be of 6-month duration). Activity One: The objective of Activity One is to make available grants to fund infrastructure and equipment needs of smallholders on a cost-share basis to further AERI objectives of rural income and horticultural export growth. Activity Two: The objectives of Activity two are to consolidate and build on gains made in Egypt’s agricultural competitiveness through past USAID programs, with support to key technological elements of the marketing chain for strategically selected agricultural commodities promoted by trade associations. Activity Five: The objective of Activity five is to assure long-term sustainability for certain project elements. 
 
The work conducted under the Contract awarded through this RFP will be integrated with implementation mechanisms for other activities under AERI. USAID encourages qualified bidders to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of project objectives. Bidders must propose an approach that carries out the project objectives and seeks to institutionalize the thrust of the objectives. We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a June 29, 2003.

<DESC>NA NOTE:  . THE RESPONSE TIME PROVIDED HEREIN IS ONLY AN ESTIMATE.  INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ADVISED TO REFER TO THE INTERACTIVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES PAGE (IBOP)/ARMY SINGLE FACE TO INDUSTRY (ASFI) FOR UPDATES TO THIS, AND OTHER INFORMATION. In accordance with (IAW) the direction previously provided in the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), DAAB07-00-R-LBAA, dated 27 January 2000, the Government intends to execute the next phase of the Aerial Common Sensor development program.  The Government ca utions that this is not a solicitation, but is provided for planning purposes only, and subject to change. A contract will not be awarded from this announcement.  The Government intends to award a single Cost Plus X Fee contract for execution of the System  Development and Demonstration (SDD)  phase of Aerial Common Sensor (ACS) Acquisition.  The Government will require, among other documents, a technical/performance proposal, cost/price proposal, an Executive Summary of the proposal, Past Performance inform ation on work of similar type and complexity, and a Small Business Management Plan.  The purpose of this announcement is to provide industry and other Government agencies advanced notification of Government intent.  In January of 2000, the Government annou nced its intent to enter into Concept Exploration (CE) phase of the ACS acquisition. Three competing industry teams were selected and completed CE in January 2001.  The Government performed a source selection to enter into the Component Advanced Developmen t (CAD), since renamed Technology Development (TD).  These activities are scheduled to conclude in July 2003.  It is the intent of the Government to enter into a SDD phase for systems development and integration in accordance with the 24 March 03 Operation al Requirements Document (ORD), the ACS Performance Based Specification (PBS), and the ACS Statement of Objectives (SOO)/Statement of Work (SOW).  SDD will have the primary objective of completing a detailed system design then translate and execute the des ign into a stable, interoperable, producible, supportable, and cost-effective ISR system; validate the manufacturing or production process, and demonstrate system capabilities through virtual and empirical testing.  This effort will require the contractor to integrate multiple payloads on to an airborne platform, build the first SET of ISR platforms to be tested through, and in preparation for, fielding in FY 09.  The system selected in this phase must be designed for, able to accommodate, and capable of th e Evolution Acquisition Strategy (IAW DoDI 5000.2) for this program, in a cost effective and efficient process.  The team selected will additionally support Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) of the SDD developed ACS.  ACS is viewed as a major  systems integration challenge.  The Government intent is to competitively award an SDD contract, in 2QTR FY04, to a system integrator with proven capability of related, relevant, successful major airframe/intelligence systems integration.  An executive su mmary of the program, draft documents and other information and instructions will be available through the IBOP/ASFI in JUNE 2003.   A DD 254 will be provided to allow access to classified information associated with the program that is needed to respond t o the actual solicitation.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE Cage Code information in order for the Government to determine facility clearance verification for receipt of classified documents.  Note: The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR part 12, see note 26.

<DESC>NA Commercial Acquisition The United States Army Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), AZ has a requirement for C-123 and C-130 Aircraft Support for the balance of fiscal year 2003 with ordering periods through 30 September 2006.  Please note that the Contractor proximi ty of response time must be 2-3 hours from YPG. The Aviation and Airdrop Systems Division, YPG, manages the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s test and evaluation programs for all aspects of air delivery systems.  The systems include personnel and cargo parachute systems, aerial  delivery platforms and associated hardware, delivery techniques, and certification of equipment for airdrop. The division defines the test requirements, develops detailed test plans, executes the test program, and reviews and reports on the results. This work is done in partnership with the Natick Soldier Center, Program Manager for Soldier Support, and other government and commercial activities. Air Force aircraft are typically used for our test mission and are obtained through the Joint Airborne/Air Tran sport Training (JA/ATT) program. YPG has experienced recent difficulties in obtaining aircraft support through this process and is establishing contract support to provide Ã¢Â€Â˜back-upÃ¢Â€Â™ flight capability to the JA/ATT program. 2. Requirements. a. Saf ety: All test operations are conducted within established Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs) and/or field manuals for various systems.  The safety of range personnel and equipment is encompassed in these procedures.  The safety aspects of delivering aird rop payloads from the aircraft are coordinated with the Air Force agencies responsible for airworthiness of these aircraft. A Proposed Test Plan (PTP) is developed and staffed through the Air Force and reviewed by Natick to ensure the safe deployment from the Air Force aircraft.  The flight scenarios (e.g. airspeed, heading, deck angle) will be outlined in the PTP.  The contractor is to review the PTP, or equivalent, and provide required modifications for safe aircraft deployment. For contract airlift, the airworthiness of the proposed operation is at the discretion of the contractor operating the aircraft. A PTP (or equivalent) will be provided to the contractor for review/approval. The contractor retains liability for the aircraft throughout operations inc luding deployment of the test item. The contractor assumes no liability for the test item itself. YPG retains all liability for personnel and equipment on the ground. A joint (contractor/government) inspection will be performed of all test payloads and air craft loading operations. The government personnel will function solely as advisors to the contractor. YPG will provide an on-board safety monitor for all flight operations. The contractor must comply with the YPG Standing Operating Procedure (YP-MTRO-P-10 00), Range Operations, and all airfield operations policies and procedures. b. Mission Briefings: The contractor flight crew and aircraft loading/maintenance personnel, will attend pre- and post-flight mission briefings. These briefings will provide the de tailed mission scenario required for each flight activity.  YPG test directors will conduct the briefing. The contractor shall review the information presented and provide an assessment of the readiness of the aircraft and safety of the aircraft operations . c. Aircraft Loading Operations:  The contractor shall provide suitably trained personnel for aircraft loading operations. d. Flight Test Operations: The aircrew, as directed by the YPG test director, shall execute the mission profile and maintain communi cations as required in the mission brief.  The aircraft personnel will record in-flight test observations for discussion at the post-flight mission briefing. Predominantly, testing will be conducted within YPGÃ¢Â€Â™s restricted airspace (typically R-2306A/ B/C/D/E). However, periodic flights may be required within other restricted areas or in commercial airspace.  The flight crew maintains the responsibility for c omplying with all Federal Aviation Regulations. e. Aircraft Refueling:  The aircrew will contact Laguna Army Airfield (LAAF) operations to request fuel. YPG personnel will perform the refueling operation.  The contractor shall provide oversight of this ope ration as required to ensure safety of the aircraft. 3. Scope of Effort: Each test flight is typically scheduled for a two-hour duration with pre-mission briefings and loading operations commencing approximately 2-hours prior to the scheduled mission time.   Post-flight debriefings are typically conducted 1-hour after the scheduled drop time. Up to three sorties per day may be conducted. The contractor should provide the crew-rest requirements and YPG will schedule the missions within those requirements. App roximately 10-15 flight hours per week are envisioned during a scheduled mission week for 2-3 test weeks per month.  The contractor shall provide the aircraft (including POL), all support personnel, and all support equipment required for these operations.  Non-standard equipment can be provided by YPG with proper coordination. C-123 Aircraft Requirements.  The aircraft will be a C-123, CASA 212 or 235, Shorts Skyvan or Sherpa, DHC-3 Twin Otter, DHC-5 Buffalo, or equivalent type with the following attributes : (1) Operable UHF and VHF radios (preferably two of each) (2) Operable flight deck and cargo compartment, (3) Oxygen systems with the capability of supporting a supplemental oxygen system, (4) Ability to operate at altitudes up to 15,000 feet MSL, (5) Abi lity to deploy: a.

This shall include a break down of each terminals usage including the terminals mobile number, date and time of each call, zone called, number called, country call name, service type, duration of call, price per unit and total charge for the call.  There should be a summary page, which lists all Coast Guard terminals and their respective monthly charge and total minutes used.  Typically about 97% of all Coast Guard Mobile Earth Station (MES) originated calls are to the United States Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and are therefore within the INMARSAT Zone 1 coverage area.  The remainder of calls are made up of Zones 2, 3 and MES to MES.  The total number of minutes used per month varies widely and highly depends upon world events.  For the past 7 months the Coast Guard has averaged 11,500 minutes per month.  Based on past performance it is estimated that of the 11,500 total minutes about 11,200 would be from MES to Zone 1 countries (mostly the United States), 100 minutes to Zone 2; 100 minutes to Zone 3; and approximately 100 minutes are MES to MES calls. Bidders are required to use per minute rates; one for each Zone, and one for MES to MES calls.  Use columns for each zone, citing the monthly cost, yearly cost and the total price for the base and four option years. The average minutes are being provided in the sample chart for calculation purposes.  It is required that bidders use this sample chart:(See Attachment 1). The Government will utilize this sample methodology to arrive at the overall lowest rate per
minute. Bidders are to calculate their figures using this methodology for the base and four option years.  Your proposals should be sent to the following address:  Commandant (G-ACS-1B/CL), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001.  The Coast Guard will award a contract to the lowest responsible bidder offering the lowest total price.  The Government may reject any or all bids.  The following FAR provisions apply: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-3,Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and     Conditions-Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders- Commercial Items; 52-217-8, Option to Extend Services; 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center and Los Angeles Air Force Base  (SMC/LAAFB) intend to issue an Official Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about 27Jun2003.  This proposed action is a competitive 8(a) acquisition for providing Custodial services at LAAFB and the Air Force Space and Missile Systems.  The proposed new contract requires the contractor to perform basic custodial services in the Base Medical Clinics, the Child Development Centers, the Base Fitness Centers, and general commercial-type office facilities.  Custodial services required involve three types of standards:  quality standards, frequency standards, and performance standards.  Quality standards require that appropriate surfaces are free of dirt, debris, lint, smudges, streaks, etc.  Frequency standards require cleaning tasks to be performed at certain times, i.e., weekly, twice weekly, three times weekly, etc.  Performance standards are based on the number of defects permitted before a service is considered unsatisfactory. In all Medical facilities the required cleaning will be in accordance with the Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) (www.apic.org) and the American Society for Healthcare Environmental Services (ASHES) (www.ashes.org).  These two organizations pretty much write the prescriptive commonly accepted housekeeping practice guidelines for the healthcare industry.  All potential contractors will have experience in or knowledge of generally accepted healthcare industry housekeeping/cleaning practices.    Immunizations, health screening, and personnel background investigations will be required of employees working in all Medical and Child Development Centers.  At this time, Child Development Centers, Fitness Centers, and all office facilities total approximately 912,089 square feet and are located at LAAFB in El Segundo, Lawndale and San Pedro, CA.  All Medical facilities total approximately 53,563 square feet and are located at LAAFB in El Segundo and San Pedro, CA.  Any resulting contract will be subject to U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Wage Determination 94-2047 (Revision 22) dated 10Sep2002 (most current revision will be issued at RFP release).  The NAICS Code 561720 – Janitorial Services is applicable to this acquisition.  The Government anticipates the award of a Fixed Price with Indefinite Quantity CLINs type contract with a base period of performance of 12 months and up to four (4) one-year options.  The anticipated award date is 08Sep2003.  The 61ABG/CE Acquisition Team is planning to hold Industry Days from 08-09Jul2003 at LAAFB, 2420 Vela Way, Bldg 212, 1st Floor Conference room, near the intersection of El Segundo Blvd and Aviation Streets in El Segundo, CA.  The Industry Day will include a Government presentation of the work to be performed and conduct a one-on-one question and answer period along with a tour of several high visible areas that will be included in this contract. The one-on-one discussions are to permit interested contractors an opportunity to provide the Government with feedback to questionnaires provided to industry and inputs to the proposed acquisition.  Interested parties are requested to have prepared responses to the Government questions in narrative or chart format at the One-on-One sessions.  Contractors considering teaming arrangements are encouraged to bring teammates to the Industry Day session.    The solicitation for a proposal will follow and a contract will be awarded based on information submitted in response to the requested documentation identified in the RFP.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Persons attending the Industry Day/One-on-Ones must provide two forms of picture identification for entry to LAAFB and their vehicles may be searched prior to entry onto the base.  Interested contractors shall contact Marla P. Jordan, via FAX:  310-363-5499 or e-mail: marla.jordan@losangeles.af.mil, not later than 02Jul2003, or Mrs. Lavern M. Wirrie, via e-mail: laverne.wirrie@losangeles.af.mil, to schedule one-on-ones, receive questionnaires, and provide names of attendees.

This action is an expansion of the current contract.  Minot State University has already established the methodology for the study and maintains all data previously gathered in this project.  It would be difficult if not impossible for another entity to continue with the program without the expertise developed by Minot State University and without access to the proprietary data maintained by the University.  Therefore, to compete this project and award to another contractor would cause an undue expense to the Government, the loss of valuable research already conducted, and the risk of not completing the project requirements in Fiscal Year 2003. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<SOLNBR>N0001403R0015
<RESPDATE>080603
<ARCHDATE>08292003
<CONTACT>Wade Wargo, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-2574, Email wargow@onr.navy.mil - Susan Sutherland, Branch Head ONR Code 251, Phone 703-696-4601, Email suthers@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has a requirement for the Phase 2 development of the Electronic Warfare Integrated System for Small Platforms (EWISSP) program.  This notice is to announce the Office of Naval Research’s (ONR) release of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the design, development, fabrication, integration and test and evaluation of the EWISSP.  The EWISSP program is a joint Government/Industry effort.  The EWISSP concept is to develop a highly integrated and compact EW system to protect small platforms.  EWISSP will develop a family of sensor and countermeasure subsystems with applications to a variety of small platforms that have little or no self-protection against smart weapons or munitions.  EWISSP will provide a combination of Radio Frequency (RF), Infrared (IR), and Laser sensors to detect threats against platforms operating in the Littorals.  EWISSP sensors will detect emitters to provide situation awareness, hostile intent and cueing of countermeasures.  EWISSP countermeasures will include combinations of onboard and offboard RF, IR, and Laser responses that contribute to both self-protection as well as countermeasures against threat targeting and surveillance sensors to disrupt, dilute, confuse, and defeat the enemy’s ability to launch effective attacks against amphibious forces.  The objective is to improve platform survivability by providing an EW system for self-protection as well as a system that is integrated in a network centric environment to allow the netting of sensors and countermeasures among the various units deployed on a specific mission.  

This RFP will provide for award of an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contract(s).  The contract will have a five-year ordering period.  The initial task order is for the design, development, fabrication, integration and test of an EWISSP on an Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV) developed by the Marine Corps.  This initial task order will have a four-year period of performance.   Future task orders under this contract could include work to support Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decisions, including production engineering, preparation of production documentation and qualification testing, and the tasking for the actual production and testing of limited quantities of system/subsystems, i.e., LRIP, for installation on the AAAV.   This IDIQ contract will allow for the issuance of orders by ONR and the Marine Corp's AAAV Program Office.  ONR anticipates the basic contract will have a maximum ordering ceiling of $75M.   Funding of $15-20M is anticipated to be made available for the initial task order.

The solicitation will be made available on the ONR website at http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/rfps/n00014_03_r_0015/ on approximately 18 JUN 2003.  No hardcopies of this RFP will be mailed, faxed, or emailed.  In order to submit a proposal under this solicitation, Offerors must possess a SECRET facility clearance with SECRET safeguarding.  The RFP will be unclassified, but the System Requirements Document (SRD) will be classified Secret and therefore will be provided under separate cover.  The SRD will only be provided to interested Offerors who have a SECRET facility clearance with SECRET safeguarding.  The SRD will be mailed in hardcopy or on CD ROM to Offerors upon request via the following methods: Mail to Office of Naval Research, Ballston Centre Tower One, Attn: Wade Wargo, ONR 251, 800 N. Quincy Street, Rm. 720, Arlington, VA, 22217-5660; Email to wargow@onr.navy.mil; or Fax to 703-696-0066.  All requests should include RFP Number, Company Cage Code, Facility address, and Request Point of Contact information.  Requests for the SRD can be sent immediately after publication of this synopsis.  Additional classified background documentation will be made available to Offerors for viewing at the Naval Research Laboratory weekdays from 0900 to 1500 (local time) starting on the date of RFP issuance until the due date for proposals.  Interested Offerors should consult the ONR website (http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/rfps/n00014_03_r_0015/) around the approximate date of RFP issuance for further instructions on how to visit NRL to view this information.

An Industry Day is tentatively scheduled for Friday, 27 JUN 2003 at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), 4555 Overlook Avenue SW Washington, DC 20375-5326 in Building 210, Conference Room 1440.

<DESC>The Specialized Diagnostics Unit of the Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research., National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Dako Corporation 6392 Via Real, Carpinteria, CA 93013, immunohistochemical staining reagents and antibodies.   The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12 and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedure for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.    The North American Industry Classification System Code is 422210 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The Laboratory of Pathology currently offers tests using numerous reagents and antibodies.  Each antibody that is used in the laboratory is subjected to rigorous quality control procedures that test the antibody's reactivity and sensitivity.   The reagents are used for diagnostic immunohistochemistry laboratory clinical use as well as for supporting clinical and basic research in the Laboratory of Pathology.   The primary Dako reagents and antibodies that are required, include the following: 1) detection reagents, 2) high sensitivity polymer-based amplification systems, 3) high sensitivity non-radioactive amplification systems for immunohistochemical staining, 4) ancillary reagents, 5) antibodies, 6) secondary reagents, 7) negative control reagents, and 8) non-radioactive amplification systems for immunohistochemical staining.  As new items are introduced they shall be added to the contract for ordering as needed.  Furthermore, the high sensitivity non-radioactive amplification systems for immunohistochemical staining and the high sensitivity polymer-based amplification systems, along with other reagents/antibodies, are proprietary lines that can only be purchased through Dako.   Changing vendors at this time would force the laboratory to retest and perform quality control procedures on all of approximately 75 antibodies traditionally ordered from Dako.  Even if quality controls are met, the same antibody from other vendors may present differences in staining due to packaging differences (diluent or added carriers).  Therefore, to maintain consistency in staining and in the interpretation of the slides, the Laboratory of Pathology must purchase the same antibodies from Dako.   There is no other source known by the NCI researcher that can perform the above requirement.  Period of Performance:  Upon award through twelve (12) months with four (4) with four, one-year options is also anticipated.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Service (11/99) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (3/00) apply. This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above reagents, antibodies and supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can provide the above items.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1 PM (local Washington DC time) on June 26, 2003.   If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Radiation Oncology Branch, (ROB), plans to procure a service agreement with Radionics Software Application, Inc., 22 Terry Avenue, Burlington, MA 01803, for a base year plus two (2) option year period for stereotactic radiosurgery system which includes fixed applicators, couch stabilizers, dual accelerator installation, minimum multileaf collimator, and computerized system for stereotactic conformal and dynamic treatment planning. 
The services will be procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 811310 and the business size standard is $6M.  The work being generated by NCI, and the clinical protocols used by the ROB clinic, require that current, up to date devices be implemented for the stereotactic radiosurgery system.  ROB will exchange the existing, outdated HP computer and monitor for a new computer and monitor.  In addition, Radionics shall provide  service for the stereotactic radiosurgery system allowing the continued treatment of patients on current and future protocols.  Currently, the patients are being treated off site due to the current status of the machine and doctors cannot properly provide treatment to their patients. The service agreement for this system shall include upgrading these units to current standards used on newer models.    
The current system functions on existing NCI and future purchases of linear accelerators.  The system provides stereotactic positioning, immobilization and alignment hardware, precision stereotactic applicators and an FDA approved treatment-planning system.   This system is vital to the growing success of the Radiation Oncology Clinic, as well as, the well-being of our patients. There is no known equivalent surgical software and hardware available on the market that can be integrated for use with the stereotactic radiosurgery system and linear accelerator.  Preventative Maintenance:  Contractor shall perform standard contract maintenance during the contract period.  All parts, labor, and travel expenses required to keep instrument functioning properly shall be included.  Service shall be performed by technically qualified factory trained personnel.  Service consists of recalibration of the system, lubrication of motion stages, testing of all safety interlocks, and inspection and replacement, if needed, of all other components in the system in accordance with the manufacturers latest established service procedures.  All equipment shall be operationally tested through at least one complete operating cycle at the end of the preventive maintenance inspection to assure optimum and efficient performance.  Emergency Services: Emergency service shall be provided during the term of this contract at no additional cost to the Government.  Emergency service shall be provided during normal working hours, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays.  The workstation is backed by the Contractors four (4) hour service response team. Emergency service calls shall not replace the necessity for scheduled PMI's. Personnel:  Personnel shall have factory training and experience in servicing the stereotactic radiosurgery system including  the Xknife and ImageFusion software and hardware covered by this service contract.  All primary service personnel shall have at least one backup support and have at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this contract.  Period of Performance:  Base year, upon award through 12 months; Option year 1 and 2 shall be for 12 months.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services" (November 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract" (March 2000) applies.  The software and hardware of the Xknife and ImageFusion shall be in accordance with the manufacturers latest established service procedures, to include telephone access and technical support for use of program software and trouble shooting of the operating systems at no additional costs to the Government.  Software maintenance and updates shall include automatic transmittal of upgrades to software as well as new version of the Xknife and ImageFusion software.   Xknife and ImageFusion software and hardware  is proprietary to Radionics Software Applications, Inc.  As a result, Radionics is the only known source that can provide the software and hardware required to bring the aforementioned system up to the standards and specifications required to maintain the instrument being used in clinical protocols and patients. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, (local Washington DC time), on June 26, 2003.  If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via fax 301-402-4513 or via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a competition resulting in an award of an Independent Testing Contract [ITC] to perform Quarterly Release Test Management (QRTM) and regression testing on the Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) and the Common Working File (CWF).  Currently Medicare fiscal intermediaries (FIs) use the FISS as the primary component of Medicare bill processing function under Medicare Part A. FISS Part A Medicare claims processing includes inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health, hospice care and other areas of institutional claims processing.  The purpose of the overall effort is to significantly improve the quality of standard systems software releases.  The effort requires various levels of traceability and methodical development and management of testing items such as standard systems business requirements, testing requirements, testing strategies, regression test cases, quarterly release test cases, test results and test metrics.  The scope of this testing effort includes the FISS and CWF systems that perform FI fee-for-service claims processing and the integrated fee-for-service claims processing software components that are integrated with the FISS systems.  These components include but are not limited to the various Pricers, Outpatient Code Editor (OCE), Medicare Code Editor (MCE), Grouper, and the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System [HIGLAS] payment component modules. All efforts shall be performed in accordance with CMS requirements and shall meet the objectives of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of QRTM and RT operations.  The regression testing program includes three areas of work: 1) business rules identification, 2) test-set development and maintenance, and 3) test preparations, executions, results analysis and reporting.  The contractor shall continue to maintain the existing regression testing schedules, products and processes to fully implement the comprehensive regression test program.  The contractor shall work with the incumbent contractor to assure a transition period through September 30, 2003 to ensure full continuity of the regression-testing program.  The Contractor shall maintain a detailed schedule for all regression testing related tasks in Microsoft Project.  The schedule shall include all activities and tasks from business rules related tasks to execution results reporting. To improve the software quality of the systems that support FI claims processing (e.g. FISS, CWF, Pricers, OCE, MCE, Grouper), CMS has implemented the QRTM initiative. The QRTM for the FI claims processing initiative consists of testing current quarterly release CRs through the integrated FISS and CWF Beta test sites'effort to emulate the production claim-processing environment.  The Beta test sites that support FI claims processing will execute integrated data exchanges simulating FI claims processing test cycles using the CMS supplied test-set and submit the results to CMS and the testing contractor.  The testing contractor shall assimilate the test results, develop test metrics, verify requirements traceability, and create metrics, test summary and risk assessment reports.  The Contractor will also require proficiency in the COTS products that are currently being used to support the CMS testing initiatives.  These COTS products include: The Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System (DOORS), WinRunner, COMPAREX, TestDirector, and FileAid. These initiatives also require knowledge of COBOL as required to map copybooks to VSAM files to successfully perform file comparisons and data manipulations; proficiency in JCL to run jobs such as file comparisons and data selections; and proficiency in mainframe utilities such as TSO/ISPF and INFOMAN.  These initiatives require extensive, broad-based Medicare business and technical knowledge and skills. CMS intends to award a full and open competitive Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract for a one-year base, with four one-year option periods.  SETA Inc. is the incumbent contractor. The anticipated release of the RFP is on or about November 22, 2002 and will be available on FedBizOpps.  If you register with FedBizOpps, you will receive any subsequent RFP information.

<DESC>This project is located in the North Fork of American Fork Canyon on the Uinta National Forest.  The work site is referred to as the Bog Mine and is located in a remote area of Mineral Basin.  This project will treat a mine waste rock pile that has elevated concentrations of heavy metals including lead, zinc, iron, cadmium, etc.  An EE/CA has been prepared for this project, available at the Uinta National Forest Supervisor’s Office, addressing the health concerns related to the heavy metals and the removal action to be implemented at the mine site.  This project consists of expanding an existing borrow area, installing a temporary stream crossing including erosion control features, reshaping a mine waste rock pile, removing small piles of mine waste from the Iron Bog, covering the reshaped waste pile with 30 inches of borrow material, repairing a concrete barrier blocking access to the mine tunnel, spreading topsoil salvaged from the borrow area over the borrow area, installing a rock barrier between the borrow area and Mineral Basin Road, furnishing and installing an interpretive sign, and applying seed, fertilizer, and mulch to the disturbed areas.  Some repairs to the main access road will be required to accommodate the contractor’s use. Contractor will be responsible for the disposal of materials.  40 hours of Hazwoper Training, with current certification, will be required for all personnel working on site at this project because of the heavy metal concentrations in the waste rock pile.  This will apply until the mine waste pile is completely covered with soil and ready for seeding.  The project has a Government estimate between $25,000 - $100,000.  100% payment bond or Irrevocable letter of credit is required after award.  The approximate posting date for the solicitation and applicable drawings / maps will be 26 June 2003 to this same website. There will be a show-me trip on 8 July 2003 @ 10:00 a.m.  This is the only time the site is available to visit – plan accordingly.  Those interested will meet at Little Cottonwood Canyon at the second scenic overlook located 1 1/4 miles above the Tanner Flat Campground at 10:00 a.m.  We will travel in convoy from there through Snowbird Ski Resort into upper Mineral Basin in the North Fork of American Fork Canyon to the job site. Four wheel drive vehicles will be needed and the tour will last into the late afternoon.  The start date for project is anticipated to be 11 Aug 2003 with a period of performance approximately 30 days.  *****

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command intends to modify contract N00019-03-C-6517 to build a CV-22 Cabin Part Task Trainer.  The CV-22 Cabin Part Task Trainer (CPTT) will provide the initial hands on training capability for CV-22 Flight Engineers.  This device will consist of two parts, providing training for cargo handling, (load, unload, restraint, and airdrop rigging), ingress/emergency egress, manual release/operation of the windows and doors, and the Cockpit Management System (CMS). The fuselage trainer is a full-sized replica of the fuselage from the nose to the end of the horizontal stabilizer, including the lower portion of the vertical stabilizer. It will have a self-contained hydraulic system and transportable undercarriage allowing for easy transport.  In addition to the above trainer, an examination of the Flight Engineers enabling objectives has identified the need for a desktop device to introduce the aircraft’s complex CMS to the Flight Engineer.  This device should not be a part of the fuselage trainer, but a PC based device that would allow the student to navigate CMS layers as well as run checklists in a classroom environment.  Together, these devices will form the CPTT and provide for training that would otherwise be accomplished on the actual aircraft thus eliminating the need and risk of scheduling a mission ready aircraft.  Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office (JPO), 47123 Buse Rd. Patuxent River, MD 20670 will perform the work The CPTT will be co-located with the V-22 Naval Aviation Maintenance Trainer Suite (NAMTS) at New River MCAS, Jacksonville, North Carolina.  The Bell-Boeing team is the designer, developer and sole producer of the CV-22 tilt rotor aircraft and is currently performing the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and the low-rate initial-production (LRIP) of these aircraft.  Bell-Boeing is the only source that possesses the engineering data; technical skills; and requisite knowledge of the design, fabrication, performance, and operational characteristics of the CV-22 aircraft to design and build the CPTT.See Note 22

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  This technology is a multi-source ion funnel for mass spectrometer instruments.  It is designed to introduce ions generated in a region of high pressure into a region of low pressure using at least two electrospray ion sources, at least two capillary inlets, and at least two “ion funnels”.  The technology may also include a jet disturber positioned within one or more of the ion funnels that utilizes voltage to control the transmission of ions. The technology enables both static and dynamic control of ion transmission and modulation of calibrant ion peak intensities, while maintaining high transmission of analyte ions.  Thus, it provides a basis for simultaneously improving sensitivity, dynamic range, and mass measurement accuracy. Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an updated list of the anticipated functional areas and the list of anticipated core labor categories for each functional area.  As we announced in our last project update, the labor category scenario presented in our original draft requirements document has been modified as a result of recommendations received during Industry Day sessions.  Rather than requiring contractors to propose on a long list of labor categories for each functional area as was originally anticipated, contractors will be required to propose on government identified core labor categories for each functional area in which they are competing.  Contractors may also propose the additional labor categories they deem necessary to provide the full gamut of service support in the functional area(s) in which they are competing.   CONTRACTORS NOTE:  DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT, NO QUESTIONS OR ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS REGARDING THE DHS SPIRIT PROJECT ARE BEING ACCEPTED.  E-MAILS OR TELEPHONIC INQUIRIES RECEIVED WILL NOT BE ADDESSED.  All further DHS SPIRIT project information, including the RFP, will be posted on this site as it becomes available.

<DESC>This modification incorporates FAR 52.219-14, "LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING (DEC 1996)" into the SOLICITATION/SYNOPSIS.

Offerors intending to subcontract must do so in accordance with 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 124.520.  (CFR=Code of Federal Regulations).



The following information is posted in response to questions regarding Federal Emergency Management Agency RFP No. EMW-2003-RP-0025.

Question:	“..is it mandatory to bid for every language combination in the Performance Work Statement or can we select some of the languages and bid for those?”

Answer:	The languages listed in Appendix A of the Performance Work Statement are those languages that FEMA has previously encountered in the past.  The number of languages an Offeror can translate will be evaluated under No. 2, “Technical Capabilities,” of the Technical and Past Performance Evaluation Factors.  Therefore, the number of languages an offeror can translate will effect the technical rating.

Question:	“Will this be awarded to more than one respondent?”

Answer:	The Government will award one contract “resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered (Synopsis/Solicitation (ix)).”		

Question:	“What is you(r) position on 8(a) firms teamed with others to respond to this solicitation?”

Answer:	See this modification to the synopsis/solicitation (above) for details.

Question:	“Will DHA/FEMA provide all the 800 line connectivity to vendors?”

Answer:	“The contractor shall maintain adequate telecommunications systems capable of meeting the proposed FEMA call volumes.  This presupposes the availability of dedicated T-1 lines serving the call centers established for this purpose… (PWS 3.4).”
		“The contractor shall provide sufficient lines…(PWS 3.1).”

Question:	How will the agency distinguish dialects and languages to forward to vendors?”

Answer:	“If an agent services a caller who speaks a language that the agent is not directly capable of understanding, the agent must have immediate access to an interpretation support service (Synopsis/Solicitation).”  If the agent does not understand the language of the caller, contractor services will be required.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number N68836-03-T-0192 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the lastest Federal Acquisition Circular.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, NAICS 333315.  The Trident Refit Facility, Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay Ga 31547 requires: 2 each Duplex Document Scanners (suggested model Canon DR-3080C); 2 each OTG Applicatin Xtender Single User w/Scanextender; 2 each Scan Station/Image Server, Pentium 4, 2.53GHZ, 384MB Ram, 80GB HD, CD-R Recorder, 20/40GB Tape System w/11 each Tape Media, 17" Flat CRT Color Monitor, Windows XP PRO; 2 each Professional Services to include Application Design, Implementation, Installation, On-Site Training, Customized Procedures and Manuals; 2 each One Year Standard Service Agreement on equipment;
STATEMENT OF WORK:
The Trident Refit Facility (TRIREFFAC) is a Department of The Navy (DON), Intermediate Repair Facility in support of the fast overhaul and turnaround of Ohio Class Trident Nuclear Submarines.  Servicing the Trident Submarines, being nuclear in nature, presents unique data storage and retrieval requirements that include recording and storing a variety of sensitive documents and special work orders. In many cases this data is maintained for the life of the submarine (appx. 50 years) and should be able to be reproduce on demand.  The reproduced documents must be of high quality and meet all legal specification for signature authenticity. 
TRF currently uses a Canonfile 510 system to scans and index the target document.   The Canonfile 510 system stores the images and indexes the information onto a double-sided 502 MB magneto optical (MO) disk.  This process continues until both sides of the MO are full.  Each side of the MO disk is then transferred to the local hard drive.  This process uses a DOS based downloader program "Albase" to accomplish this task.  This process takes approximately 2 hours per disk to complete.   The converted information is transferred from the hard drive to CD ROM.  Two CD ROMs are generated for back up purposes.  CD ROM index information is transferred to the 16 bit Albase application and made available for retrieval.  The 502 MB MO disk is then formatted and the process starts over again from the beginning.  This entire process is repeated over and over again and has become the standard way of storing images.
Retrieval of documents is accomplished by using the 16 bit Albase application.  After a document search has been executed, the end user is prompted to insert the appropriate CD ROM containing the information.  The current information is stored on a combination of 502 MB MO disk and Albase CD ROM. 
TRF Code 420 records, processes and files approximately 3,000, two sided pages, per day, when recording.  Several different types of records/documents are processed, they are: 1. Refit Records, 2. Material Records, 3. Triper Records, 4. Supervisor Records, 5. End-Of-Refit letters and 6. Transfer Log Records.  Each of these records has it's own unique indexing structure and are subject to the same index and storage process as explained above.  These records are retained for the life of the boat, which equates to approximately 50 years.
The current Canonfile Document Imaging System's scanning, indexing and storage process is cumbersome, inefficient and no longer supported by the vendor.  This outdated system relies on 16 bit technology and will not operate under the newer 32 bit environment.  The existing 502 MB MO disks are no longer available.  The current system is incapable of growth or expansion.  The hardware components are no longer manufactured and when spare parts are exhausted this system will remain inoperable.
TRF needs to upgrade the existing file imaging system to a more modern, state-of-the-art, document imaging system that employs open-system architecture commonly used in industry.  This system should provide at a minimum all of the features currently provided by the existing system listed above.  In addition the new system should be expandable to a fully networked solution that utilizes networking technology commonly used in industry that includes but not limited to Token-Ring 16 MBPS and Ethernet 100 MBPS LAN interface.
Proposed Solution:
Provide a modern, state-of-the-art, File Imaging System that employees open system architecture, which is widely acceptable in industry.  All components proposed should be readily available, off-the-shelf and commonly used in industry.  All hardware and software should be transportable and interface with like systems.
This system should be easily upgraded to a fully networked LAN version.  All associated software and hardware should be compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows NT operating systems.  The system should have the ability to interface with either/or Token-Ring and Ethernet LANs. The system should meet all of the storage and retrieval requirements listed above.
The file imaging system should have a fully automated backup capability.  The system needs to be easy to use and efficient.  The system needs to provide fast and accurate indexing that allows personnel to efficiently pinpoint documents within the file.  The system should allow the user to intelligently organize, index and store any type of data file in the user-defined applications, enable quick and easy retrieval of mission critical data.  Also, provide an advanced graphical user interface that makes it easy to capture, display, index, store, retrieve, route and process documents and other data files.
The system should provide storage management software that will automatically and intelligently manage data and image storage and retention.  Provide fast backup and data protection.  Provide efficient access to critical data from the workstations.
The high speed document scanner should be a desktop version that can scan up to 11 in. x 17 in. size, double-sided documents on a single feed duplex read (one-pass/two sided scanning).  Provide a 100 sheet auto feeder for 8.5 in. x 11 in. paper at 86 images per minute (duplex). 
Engineering And Services:   As part of this order the vendor will provide all engineering and installation support  necessary to assure the document imaging system is properly installed, operational and meets the customer's needs.  The vendor will provide onsite training to assure the customer can properly operate and maintain, from a user's perspective, all components and features of the imaging system.  The vendor will provide all documentation to include operator manuals, system specifications, and maintenance manuals as they apply.
The following provisions and clauses apply: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items and citing: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.222-41 and 52.222-42; 252.204-7004 Central Contractor Registration; 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes Applicable to Defense Acquisition of Commercial Items, and citing 252.225-7001.  Offers are due by close of business 15 Jun 2003 and may be emailed or faxed to 912/673-2191.

The following has been added by modification to original notice: this is for a three (3) concurrent user system that is expandable to a fully networked version that can support the document archiving needs of other departments throughout the command.

<DESC>AMENDED TO CHANGE HERBICIDE REQUIREMENTS. (THIS SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION REPLACES ALL THE PREVIOUS SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION)

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemental and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be used.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation number is RFQ-R8-03-16.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17.  The applicable Standard Industrial Classification 325320 and size standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Forest Services is soliciting for the acquisition of the following herbicides/pesticides:  Item 1a – Glyphosate 4#/gallon (no surfactant) 2.5 gallon container (2 per box) 600 gallons OR Item 1b – Glyphosate 5.4#/gallon (no surfactant) 2.5 gallon container (2 per box) 450 gallons OR Item 1c - a mix of the 2 formulations yielding the equivalent poundage of ai.; Item 2 – Velpar L (product specific; no substitutions) 2.5 gallon container (2 per box), 1500 gallons; Item 3 – Arsenal Applicators Concentrate (Forestry 4 lb ai) (product specific; no substitutions) 1 quart container (4 per box) 100 gallons; Item 4 –Arsenal (2 lb ai) (product specific; no substitutions) 1 quart container (4 per box) 100 gallons; Item 5 – Triclopyr amine in water solution 1000 gallons of 3# a.i. per gallon product or equivalent amount of a.i. (4050 lbs a.i.) in alternative formulation 2.5 gallons container (2 per box) 1000 gallons of 3# a.i. per gallon product or equivalent amount of a.i. (4050 lbs a.i.) in alternative formulation; and Item 6 – Triclopyr ester solution  2.5 gallons container (2 per box) 800 gallons of 4# a.i. per gallon product or equivalent amount of a.i. (4000 lbs a.i.) in alternative formulation.  Products 2-4 are product specific (to meet Environment Protection Agency (EPA) labeling requirements), and package size specific to meet desired storage and use safety standards. While other products or packaging is available it is unacceptable due to either to regulatory or safety constraints.  
 
Products 1a, 1b and lc are equivalent products, calculations reflecting the fact that different formulators package at different rates of active ingredient per gallon.  Either rate per gallon is acceptable if tendered product is labeled for forestry use and the formulation contains no surfactant.  Packaging other than 2 per box is acceptable but 2.5 gallon/container is the maximum volume container acceptable.  Proposed working for the quote would be "Glyphosate as a solution in water without – 2400 lbs ai as either 600 gallons of a 4 lb ai/gallon formulation, 450 gallons of a 5.4 lb ai/gallon formulation, or a combination of the two formulation weights (2.5 gallon containers, 2 per box); must be labeled for forestry use."  Quoters may submit a quote on Items 1a or lb.  (Separate listings are given to allow purchase of existing 4# ai/gallon stock or to procure appropriate 5.4# ai/gallon products).  

Product 5 is formulated triclopyr – amine formulation in water solution. A total of 1350 gallons of the 3# a.i./gallon formulations (traditional formulation = 4050 lbs a.i.) is estimated for need. This may be filled as  3# a.i. gallon formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.i. in product formulated at a different rate of a.i./gallon.

Product 6 is formulated triclopyr – ester formulation in appropriate solution (potentially including surfactant). A total of 1000 gallons of the 4# a.i./gallon formulation (traditional formulation = 4000 lbs a.i.) is estimated for need. This may be filled as  4# a.i. gallon formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.i. in product formulated at a different rate of a.i./gallon.

Product specific EPA requires that products be labeled for "site" of application.  Any product purchased from proposed contract must have appropriate labeling to permit forest, right-of-way, or wildlife site use.  Quoters must provide products meeting this label constraints or product will be returned at awarding contractor's expense.  
All quantities are estimated.  No obligation will exist until the Government places an order.  Orders will be made by credit card or purchase order.  Quoters must be set-up to received payments by credit card.  Orders against the proposed contract must be delivered to one or combination of the following states:  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas.  A receipt of all orders placed under the proposed contract must be mailed to the Purchaser and Contracting Officer.  The proposed contract starting time will be on or around July 14, 2003.  Period of performance is one (1) year from date of contract award.  The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial applies without addenda.  Award will be made to a responsible contractor whose offer is the lowest, acceptable price and most advantageous to the Government.   Award will be made on one or more items.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the previous notice is to incorporate Questions & Answers to this RFQ as follows;
Questions & Answers -Reference No. 03-856-4202

1).   The above synopsis posted on June 9, 2003 states that for safety, NIST requires that Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. must certify the equipment.  This unit is a custom made unit to NIST specs.  The cost of getting UL approval on this type of unit could exceed the cost of the unit itself.  Most UL approvals are for mass produced products so the cost can be spread out over a large number of pieces.  In our long history of fabricating wet process equipment for the semiconductor industry this requirement has never been requested.  We use UL approved components whenever possible.  Has NIST required this certification and received it on similar pieces of equipment in the past?  We look forward to your reply.
 
Answer:   It would be sufficient to amend the safety statement to say that NIST requires that the fume hood with acid workbench shall be made from UL-approved components.  Since the requirement shall be made from a number of UL-approved components, NIST does not expect Contractors to get UL certification for the entire system.  

All other information remains the same.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.

<DESC>NA Background:  Mine detection and neutralization and minefield detection and breaching have been enduring Army challenges that must be overcome to enable Objective Force Full-Spectrum operations.  Single point detection solutions over the past 20 years (e.g.  ground penetrating radar, acoustics, Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance, etc) and limited neutralization technology efforts have not satisfied the Armys war fighting requirements.  Army Transformation has increased the difficulty of the problem through the shif t toward a lighter (less armor), more responsive (reduction in logistics) force, and greater mobility (objective to detect and neutralize mines with a 50 kph rate of advance).  Within the overall technical requirements of Countermine, accurate detection of  landmines proves an extremely difficult and complex problem, particularly because of the cluttered environment.  In recent years, numerous research programs have addressed the mine detection problem by investigating sensor characteristics and developing t heoretical models for specific sensor modalities.  Typically, these models create target signatures for selected sensor modalities of interest based on target size, shape, orientation, material, etc.  These physics based models are applied toward the devel opment of improved sensors and signature response analyses algorithms over a wide range of target conditions.  The progress of the science and technology community has been hampered by a limited understanding of environmental phenomenology, which directly contributes to both reduced probability of detection of mine targets and/or increased rates of false-target alarms, and also impacts neutralization techniques. All aspects of the complex interaction between the target, the environment, and the signal energ y properties of the sensor (such as seismic, acoustic, infrared, magnetic, radar, etc.) must be understood in order to design and develop optimum detection sensors, signature analysis systems, and sensor management techniques that will confidently distingu ish all the targets (mines) in their environment (soil, vegetation, etc.) while rejecting non-targets (clutter or other disturbances in the environment).  Indeed, significant advances in mine detection/identification will likely have to incorporate these a mbient, non-linear geo-environmental constraints in the overall analysis process.   Request:  The Army requests information on capabilities for the following initiative.  The Army intends to create and sponsor a university led center which will focus on developing a core capability in countermine phenomenology.  The intent of the center i s to establish a core capability to advance the science and technology state-of-the-art related to mine detection and neutralization.  The center will develop the knowledge and understanding resulting in models to reliably predict mine signatures including  the modification of these signatures caused by a wide range of environmental conditions (soil, moisture, temperature, pressure, etc.) and eliminating or minimizing the problem of clutter and noise in the detection and identification of mines.  The center will in concert develop an experimental program to validate and establish the limitations of these models.  This approach is analogous to predicting the optical signatures of targets including the effects of atmospheric media while mitigating clutter and n oise through characterization and signal processing.  It will also establish a core capability to advance the state-of-the-art technology in mine neutralization.  Because these areas are of significant importance to the Army, a demonstrated capability to t ransition research results in a timely manner to the Army R&D community and to industry is required. To augment in-house capabilities, it is important that the center engage the broader academic and government R&D communities and partner with industry. The  center will be structured to offer free sharing of information obtained in the cooperative environment while appropriately protecting industry-specific intellectual property.  The Army is requesting information on capabilities in countermine phenomenology and related technologies to include: soil science, soil mechanics and si gnature physics (acoustic, seismic, electromagnetic, microgravity, chemical, biological, etc), earth sciences (geophysics, soil physics and hydrology, and remote sensing of the land surface, etc.), material science, detection expertise (sensors, algorithms , signal processing, fusion and optimization techniques, etc), and theoretical and empirical model development. The goal of the center is to research the phenomenology, test the concepts, develop models, algorithms, and sensor concepts, validate experiment ally, document the results, and coordinates with Army agencies to demonstrate and/or prepare Army R&D personnel to employ the models and techniques, and transition research results.  The responder's statement should include information on existing capabili ties and related projects, to include staff, expertise, infrastructure, partnerships, and transitions.  The information requested herein must be received in this office by 4:00 PM EST on Monday July 14, 2003.  Each response must be typed (with type that is  not smaller than 12 point on standard 8 1/2 inch x 11 inch paper with one (1) inch margins, 6 lines per inch). The responders are advised that their response to the request for information shall not exceed 12 pages (including figures), plus a one-page vit a per investigator. Responses shall be emailed as a Word or PDF attachment to the following address: melissa.fauber@us.army.mil

<DESC>AETC CONS is searching for sources who can provide a computerized scoring system that detects shots fired and provides immediate feedback to the instructor and trainee with respect to their target, and records and compiles statistical data with printout capability.  The programmable system may be used in galleries or open-air ranges with varying distance capability.  The system must be durable equipment for outdoor ranges with heavy use.  Specific contract requirements are as follows:
(Required attributes) 
System must be able to score the current M16A2 Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC).
	- Zeroing Phase
	- Practice Phase
	- Qualification Phase
System must have computer controlled targets.
System must be able to detect shots fired over the target area to include two meters minimum to the left, right, up and down for shots missing target.
System must transmit shot data immediately to a remote monitor at the firing point and also to that range’s control computer.
System must be capable of recording and printing statistical data including a final score card in the form of an Air Force Form 710.
System must operate in weather conditions with 25 degrees to 120 degrees Fahrenheit and be waterproof.
Targets must conform to use of frangible ammunition without a decrease in shot accuracy detection.
System must provide required functions without weapon modifications (no tethers or wires which would limit trainee movement).
System must be for LIVE fire utilizing M193 ammo vs. laser using black ammo.
One-year maintenance and support (during test period) is required; a minimum of one-year warranty on equipment and parts is required.
One week of training to seven instructors must be provided.
Number of systems:  22 – 25.
(Desired Attributes)
System should provide sighting corrections after each relay.
System should be upgradeable/expandable to incorporate multiple targets at varying distances for other courses of fire in the future.
System maintenance should be performed within a four-hour period of notification of problem and provided free of charge within the first year of service.
Other Relevant Data:  The current M-16A2 AFQC allows 16 rounds to zero the rifle.  The student fires one four-round volley and four three-round volleys.  After each volley, the student and instructor must walk down range and examine the target.  More time is then allowed for students to make sight corrections.  The goal of prototyping a computerized system is to provide greater safety, speed up the zero process for each firing point and to allow instructors to make additional corrections during the qualification process.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division intends to issue a Request for Proposal for a Dynamic Circuit Card Analyzer Test System (DCCATS) during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 with a contract award planned for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005.  The DCCATS is intended for use at the Intermediate Maintenance Level (I-Level) and will enhance the Fleet technician's ability to provide cost effective maintenance of electronic Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) and subassemblies, by integrating multi-functional testing of components with Analog Signature Analysis (ASA).  Currently, testing of CCAs is accomplished through either functional board testing or ASA.  Functional board testing is typically accomplished at the I-Level utilizing Automated Test Equipment (ATE) such as Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) and a Test Program Set (TPS).  In-circuit component testing is typically accomplished at the I-Level utilizing Analog Signature Analysis (ASA) such as the Huntron 5100DS with a Gold Disk and General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE).  The new DCCATS will functionally test each component, resulting in more accurate fault isolation than presently realized using ASA only.  Although the DCCATS will not functionally test the entire board as with CASS, development time and costs are expected to be considerably lower than with traditional ATE TPSs.  With the advent of advanced technology providing more reliable fault detection and isolation (component functional testing), it would appear cost beneficial to integrate this technology into the Level of Repair (LOR) philosophy.

NAVAIR is currently developing the DCCATS performance specification and is seeking information on available and emerging Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental Item (NDI) technologies and products that will satisfy DCCATS performance requirements.  Industry may provide any information (specifications, brochures, etc) on current or emerging products that shall satisfy DCCATS performance requirements to the following:

	Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst
	Attn:  Ms. Dianne Mount, Code 25222DM, B562-1
	Highway 547
	Lakehurst NJ  08733

The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

Additionally, the Government will host an Industry Day on July 30, 2003 at Lakehurst NJ.  The purpose of industry day is to provide potential offerors a face-to-face opportunity to apprise NAVAIR of their products and to provide input into the DCCATS performance specification.  During DCCATS Industry Day, NAVAIR will provide a brief overview of our requirements and current acquisition plans followed by a series of one-on-one meetings with individual firms (50 minute maximum for each firm).  These individual meetings will allow an opportunity for industry to provide additional information on their products and to comment and/or ask questions regarding the draft DCCATS performance specification as well as to demonstrate their products to NAVAIR.

Companies desiring to participate in Industry Day should fax their request to the contracting office:  Ms. Dianne Mount at 732-323-2359 or email to Dianne.mount@navy.mil.   Written requests are required but questions may be directed to Ms. Mount at 732-323-2903.   Appointments for individual sessions will be assigned on a first come-first served basis.  If necessary, meetings may also be scheduled for the following day, July 31.  Any electrical power or other requirements to support a demonstration should be identified in your written request.

System must be able to be transported in C-17 aircraft. The system must be operational within eight (8) days upon arrival at a site, weather dependent. Mooring system must weather vane 360 degrees with a self-contained power generation system and tether storage unit able to withstand surface winds up to 125 knots.  A ground station is required to monitor aerostat state of health, contain processing equipment and monitor payload performance data.  The system must sustain operations for periods up to six months, be configured to operate in various weather conditions and contain a weather radar system.  A satellite ground station may also be required to support television broadcasts.  HQ Air Combat Command may establish a requirement for this system and if funded, will procure a self-contained system that includes all items needed to safely operate an aerostat system at any forward operating location with the exception of the payload package.  HQ Air Combat Command will furnish the payload package and applicable payload ground station components to be integrated into the system, if funded.
 
Potential vendors are requested to submit a feasibility report on their potential capabilities of providing a re-locatable aerostat system that meets the general requirements identified above.

<SUBJECT>--Comprehensive Automated Process for Source Approval Request (CAPSAR) for 'Aviation' Spare and Repair Parts Only
<DESC>NA In the spirit of the Army's 'Lean' initiative to improve both manufacturing and administrative processes, the AMRDEC Industrial Operations Division (IOD), the Aviation Engineering Directorate, the Competition Management Office and the Acquisition Center ha ve teamed to 'lean' the Source Approval Process (SAR) procedure for prospective suppliers of 'AVIATION' spare and repair parts only.  The result of this effort is a simplified process for vendors to become approved sources, and includes a new automation to ol:  the CAPSAR.  The link to the CAPSAR program is available on the CMO website located at http://www.redstone.army.mil/cmo. (NOTE:  The Maintenance & Overhaul (M&O) SAR process is not automated.) The CAPSAR system, which went on line in May, utilizes electronic file transfer, an Internet-based infrastructure and validated logic to provide an intelligent structure to submit, evaluate, track and approve SAR requests.  The system allows the potential supplier to submit required documentation via the Internet.  Submittal of the SAR generates a tracking record within the CAPSAR database so that meaningful metrics can be established for the process.  Links to manufacturer-submitted documents provide a sea mless flow of information through the system from initial submittal to the subject matter expert.  Flagging of the records allows immediate identification of the transaction status.  In addition, since the SAR process will no longer rely on paper documenta tion, concurrent processes may transpire to expedite the approval procedure.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 5114-3-0019 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Midwest Area, Soil and Water Unit, St. Paul, MN, has a requirement/need  for a Trace Gas Analyzer "Brand Name or Equal" to Campbell Scientific’s Model TGA100 Trace Gas Analyzer.  Listed are the description of  items and quantities required: CLIN No. 1 - Model TGA100, Trace Gas Analyzer (1 unit); CLIN No. 2 -  Laser Dewar (1 unit); CLIN No. 3 - Laser Tunable for N20 (1 unit); CLIN No. 4 - Temperature Controller (1 unit); CLIN No. 5 - Gas Connector (1 unit); CLIN No. 6 - Evacuation Valve Operator (1 unit); CLIN No. 7 - Fiber Optic Interconnect Cable (1 Unit); CLIN No. 8 - Outdoor Fiber Optic (35 feet); CLIN No. 9 - Enclosure Insulated Cover (1 unit); CLIN No. 10 -  Sample Pump (1 unit); CLIN No. 11 - Suction Hose (PVC) (50 feet); and CLIN No. 12 - Sample Air Dryer (1 unit).  The analyzer will be used to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural fields.  N2O is a potent greenhouse gas, nearly 300 times more effective than CO2 in absorbing infrared radiation and contributing to global warming.  The mean atmospheric concentration is increasing rapidly, in large part due to denitrification of fertilizers applied by farmers.  We are attempting to develop new farming practices that will help reduce global warming by storing CO2 and reducing N2O;  to do that we need to measure the exchange of those gases between the surface and the atmosphere with considerable accuracy, and we need to do it under different management scenarios to compare their efficacy in reducing N2O emissions.   THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  the Trace Gas Analyzer System must meet or include these minimum requirements: (1) Must be a continuous flow-through system, with measurements made at a rate of at least 10 Hz.  (2) Must be designed for field use, rather than laboratory use with weatherproof enclosure, capability of being set up in an agricultural field, and powered by a portable generator.  (3) Must be Portable.  It must be possible to move the system from one site to another, set it up, and restart measurements within a 2-3 hour period, without extensive realignments or adjustments.  (4) Must have low power consumption of less than 800 W.  (5) Resolution.  In order to measure expected fluxes with acceptable accuracy, the instrument must be able to resolve a gradient in N2O (difference in concentration between two intakes) of 2 ppbv or better.  (6) Proven performance.  There must be proof (scientific manuscript or equivalent) that the instrument has been successfully used for measuring field-scale N2O fluxes.  (7) Input/output flexibility.  The instrument must be PC-compatible, but must also be capable of providing output signals to a datalogger and to control sampling valves.  (8) Complete system - System must include all components necessary to make concentration measurements, including pump, dryer (if needed), cryogenic cooler (if needed), software, valves, relays, etc.  Specific exceptions: calibration gases, sample line tubing, computer.  (9) Must include Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy.  (10) Must include installation and provide training on operation during instrument installation.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the DoD Medical School and Health Sciences University, Learning Resources Center, Bethesda, MD intends to procure on a sole-source basis a site license for one base year and up to four option years for an clinical reference database from Uptodate of Wellesley, MA. The electronic clinical database is an authoritative, referenced, concise electronic clinical database, synthesizing the latest scientific evidence and expert opinion, continually updated and easily accessible via the internet, and provides practical point-of-care consultations with specific recommendations for patient care for use by medical students, physicians, scientist and teaching faculty as both an educational and bedside clinical consultation tool.  The service is copyrighted and believed to be only available from Uptodate.  The electronic clinical database must meet the following specifications and capabilities: (1) Authoritative - information on the database must be peer-reviewed to assure that clinical advice is consistent with consensus expert opinion; (2) Current - information must be updated at least quarterly since advances in evidence-based medical knowledge and practice occur continually; (3) Referenced - a thorough bibliography of each area must be included to allow for clinicians or students to quickly do follow-up research to confirm specific situational advice; (4) Synthesized - information provided must not merely be referenced in studies from which the evidenced-based medical conclusions must be derived, but these conclusions must be stated explicitly in order to provide the clinicians and/or students with pertinent medical recommendations in a timely manner; (5) Concise - specific, conclusive medical advice must be presented in compact form consistent with the time-sensitive nature of the clinical situation; (6) Internet Access - this database must be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the internet in order to be consistently available throughout the world (to meet deployment needs of medical units) and across all medical environments.  This requirement has been determined to be a sole source procurement, based on the authority at FAR 6.302-1 (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source, which exempts this procurement from full and open competition.  However, offers from other interested companies providing similar service will be considered.

FOB: Destination, within 30 days ARO.  PACKING and SHIPPING: N/A.  WARRANTY: A standard commercial warranty shall be provided for the software. The Contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.

Factors that will be considered are Technical capability and price. Technical capabilities are significantly more important than price.

The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this solicitation is NOI-RML #30007.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14 dated 05/30/03. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories,
RML, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) performs research on multiple, diverse human bacterial pathogens and the host/bacterial response during infection. The LHBP has purchased a custom designed, multi-genome GeneChip® probe array specific to RML needs, containing the following bacterial genomes: Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia pestis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Coxiella burnettii and Chlamydia trachomatis.  This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of its kind exists. These gene chips will be used in RML experiments to analyze the bacterial response during host infection. The LHBP intends to purchase 1 lot of custom probe arrays, at 90 chips per lot, from Affymetrix. The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip® was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip® probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. The chips processed by NIAID are in  Frederick, MD containing the Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system currently in place in Frederick, MD.  In addition, there is no photolithography-based chip processing system on site at RML.    FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be 60 days after receipt of order (ARO).  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors—Commercial;
 FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items; FAR 52-212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders—Commercial Items; FAR 52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price.    Offerors must include along with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items.  Award will be based on the capability of the item offered to meet the above stated salient characteristics, delivery, price and past performance.  Offers may be mailed or faxed to the POC indicated above (Fax - 406-363-9376).  Offers must be submitted not later than 4:30 PM (MDST), 6/24/03. Copies of the above-referenced clauses are available upon request, either by telephone or fax.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by this Agency.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL NFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.*** This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13.***The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334513 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  All interested parties may submit a quote.*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is a leading neutron scattering research facility that serves a community of scientists from around the world. Approximately one thousand guest researchers visit every year to perform experiments, putting a great demand on the performance of the general pool of sample environment equipment used to generate the proper temperature, pressure, magnetic field, etc. This sample environment equipment is required perform with high reliability and accuracy, be simple to operate and maneuver, and be adequately protected from abuse by the inclusion of safeguards on its operation. As such, the NCNR has a requirement to buy at least two (2) top-loading closed-cycle refrigerator systems, which will be bought in two (2) different configurations. A total of five (5) systems may be purchased under this solicitation within the next two years. The two configurations are designed to interface with two different types of equipment found at the NCNR, and the base equipment shall be capable of switching between these configurations with the use of appropriate optional interfaces. *** All interested parties are invited to submit a quote for the following line items:  ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each - Top-loading closed-cycle refrigerator, configuration A, in accordance with the following specifications:  ITEM 0002: Quantity one (1) each - Top-loading closed-cycle refrigerator, configuration B, in accordance with the following specifications: A.  General system: 1. Each system includes a cryostat, two identical sample stick sets (defined under B.  Performance Specifications), temperature controller, connecting hoses and cables. 2. Systems may be purchased in two configurations, Configuration A and Configuration B. These configurations differ in their facility interfaces and neutron scattering requirements as detailed below. A delivered system shall be capable of switching between the two configurations with the appropriate, optional detachable interfaces. 3. NIST shall approve system line drawings before manufacture. 4. NIST shall be given a copy of system line drawings (not all manufacturing drawings). 5. Two copies of the operating manual shall be included with every system. 6.

Complete temperature control system shall include sensors, heaters, temperature controller, and connecting cables. 3.Sample space shall accommodate a maximum sample diameter of 50 mm.  4. Temperature control shall be stable to within 0.5 degrees Kelvin below 50 K, within 1 % above 50 K.  5. Temperature sensor accuracy at the sample position: +/- 250 mK for T < 25 K, +/- 1% for T > 25 K.  Multiple sensors may be employed. 6.Only a static volume of exchange gas or vacuum, as appropriate, may be used in the sample well. Flowing exchange gas may not be used in the sample well. 7.Two identical sample stick sets shall be included with each system. A sample stick set consists of either one or two sample sticks with temperature sensors that meet the sample temperature accuracy requirement. If more than one sample stick is required to cover the operating temperature range of the cryostat, then there shall be a minimum 150 K overlap between the temperature sensor calibration ranges meeting the accuracy requirement on the two separate sticks. No sensors shall be repositioned or removed throughout the operating temperature range of a sample stick. A system which can provide the temperature sensors using a single sample stick will be judged more highly in this technical aspect. 8.The system shall be protected against thermal damage to the sensors or the cryostat from accidental overheating of the sample well. C. Facility interface: 1. Each cryostat shall be capable of switching between Configurations A and B via detachable interfaces. The delivered systems each reflect only one of the configurations, but the detachable interfaces shall be available as optional spare parts. 2. The temperature controller shall communicate via RS-232 serial connection.  3. Electrical power requirement: must run on 30A, 220V single phase (NEMA L7-30); 20A, 208V three-phase (NEMA L21-20); or 20A, 120V single phase power (NEMA L5-20). 4. Electrical power connections shall extend at least 10 feet from equipment to power outlets. 5.Cooling water requirement: NIST can supply a maximum flow rate of 7 gpm at 40 psi with connection to a 3/4 inch chilled water source (50 degrees F). 6.The cryostat cold head shall provide lifting attachments for use with an overhead crane or hoist. 7.Cabling and hoses shall provide 15 feet of separation between cryostat and supporting compressor/temperature control. 8. Specific to Configuration A: Configuration A shall fit into a three-tiered stepped concentric cylindrical well. The stepped cylinders become progressively smaller nearer the sample space.
