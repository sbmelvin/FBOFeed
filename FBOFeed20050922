<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award on a Sole Source basis to the Center for Geotechnical Practice and Research at Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University (CGPR).  This contractor owns the only filter testing apparatus that can: 1. Test filter materials with particle sizes of 1.5 inches or larger. 2. Propagate artificial cracks through both the filter and base material with apertures of 1 inch, and 3. Create the correct stress conditions to model soils at depth using a membrane to simulate overburden pressures The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for the evaluation of the performance of filters in embankment dams and for the development of a simplified laboratory filter test.  This will involve a base year and one option year contract.  a. Perform a desk study and report to summarize gradations and mineralogy of existing Reclamation dams to establish the range of conditions to be simulated in the experimental testing program. b. Perform a literature review, survey, and report investigating the depth of cracking that has occurred in dams worldwide. The purpose of this task is to determine the depths of cracks and appropriate range of overburden pressures that should be simulated in the experimental testing program.  c. Perform a literature search and review of (1) chemical and biological causes of cementation in granular soils, and (2) experiences with development of cementation in granular soil filters. The review would focus on the conditions likely to lead to development of cementation in filters, methods of detecting cementation in filters, and methods of remediation.  d. Perform an experimental testing program, using the laboratory testing devices for testing cracked filters, to investigate the effects of the amount of fines and the plasticity of fines on the performance of cracked filters. The purpose of this task is to establish quantitative results that can be used as the basis for determining which materials are acceptable or unacceptable for use in filters.  e. Perform laboratory experimental studies of the self-healing ability of broadly graded filters, using the devices developed at Virginia Tech. The purpose of this task is to determine under what conditions these broadly graded materials would be capable of self-healing and establishing stable behavior without effective filters downstream.  f. Develop a simplified index test method to assess potential filter performance. The purpose of this task is to make it possible to determine whether candidate materials are acceptable or unacceptable using simple tests that can be performed in laboratories that do not have the specialized devices developed at Virginia Tech. This is not a formal solicitation.  However, concerns that respond shall provide detailed data concerning their capabilities.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with IBM Corporation of Bethesda, MD to extend the existing lease of computational capacity and related support services which provides operational air quality forecasts and warnings for the National Weather Service.  The air quality model is a permanent part of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s production suite.

Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish a system capable of meeting the previously cited requirements.  Seamless integration of the air quality enhancement into the existing HPC system architecture is required, including integration into National Weather Service’s current hierarchical storage management system.  Of particular concern to the Government is accomplishment of the system enhancement without any interruption or degradation of performance both during the actual system upgrade as well as during the remainder of the system’s life (through September 2006).  Vendors must include in its response, an explanation, in explicit detail, of its plan to implement and manage a seamless integration with the existing HPC system.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 30 days after publication of this synopsis.  SEE Note 22.

TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project type is to provide architectural and engineering design services related to the repair and alterations of an existing twenty-two story federal office building including but not limited to: replacement and upgrade of the window systems, improvements and upgrade to the outdoor Plaza, installation of a new Breezeway and Garage improvements, building exterior repairs and interior upgrades inclusive of finishes to include ground floor lobby and typical elevator lobbies, new fire protection system thru-out, replacement of all existing elevators, replace all existing lay-in ceilings and lighting fixtures, ADA upgrades as applicable, and significant improvements to the entire HVAC system thru-out.  The federal office building is located in downtown Houston, Texas. The goal of this project is to substantially enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of an existing twenty-two story federal office building and should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing character of the building and its existing urban fabric. The project delivery method will be the traditional design-bid-build.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), and post-construction contract services (PCCS) for the modernization of a federal office building that includes the construction of new interior/exterior upgrades as applicable and all the building support and related systems and site development. Space alterations are primarily finishes in the elevator lobbies and actual interior wall replacements will be minimal.  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements. 

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF PROCUREMENT
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipates a requirement for the development, evaluation, training, trial deployment and support of CAMBRIA devices for the purpose of automated screening of passenger carry-on baggage and divested articles at checkpoints to replace currently deployed carry-on baggage inspection equipment.  As part of the base effort, the Contractor shall design, fabricate, verify, and deliver three operational devices within 12 months after contract award. It is anticipated that there will be three (3) options as part of the effort to include field support services, training, and a technical data package. Option 1, for Field Support Services, includes installation of the three (3) devices not later than 6 months after exercise of option, and maintenance, site service, and logistics for 6 months after the fielding of equipment, with warranty support extending for one year after exercise of option. Option 2 includes development of a training program for the system to be delivered 2 months after exercise of the option. Option 3 is for a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support third party maintenance within 3 months after exercise of the option. 

Note that this is not a formal request for proposal.  TSA will not reimburse any preparation costs associated with responses to this announcement.

The following attachments are available under this announcement, as described below:

Attachment 1: Clearance Sponsorship Form
Attachment 2: Non-Disclosure Statement

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
The effort will require Contractors to have a CONFIDENTIAL facility and level of safeguarding clearance in accordance with the DD254.  Therefore, the Contractor shall be a participant in the National Industrial Security Program and have a CONFIDENTIAL facility clearance at time of proposal submission since Appendix A to the Technical Requirements Document (TRD) is a key part of this effort and is classified. Those companies who do not currently possess a facility clearance may complete the attached sponsorship form (ATTACHMENT 1 to this synopsis) to be submitted to Mr. Tom Jerdan at Transportation Security Laboratory, TSL-400, Building 315, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405 via email at Thomas.jerdan@dhs.gov or via fax at (609)-383-1973. Note that TSA is not responsible for granting clearances since Defense Security Service administers that process. 



NONDISCLOSURE STATEMENT ATTACHMENT 2
Since the unclassified TRD for this effort is “For Official Use Only,” the Individual who is reviewing the unclassified TRD must sign the attached Non Disclosure Agreement and fax it back by 10 May 2005 at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, to the ATTN of Ms. Sheila Roche at 571-227-1372 or 571-227-2911. That individual will be responsible for ensuring that other people in the company that read the TRD follow the same requirements as stated in the NDA.  Those individuals who have signed a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) will be emailed the unclassified TRD at a date to be determined, but prior to the pre-proposal conference.  The classified TRD will be provided to only those companies who have the proper clearances.

PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE
After the release of the RFP, it is anticipated that a pre-proposal conference will be held at Transportation Security Laboratory, William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City, NJ, for one day, sometime during the week of May 16th.  A separate announcement will be published in www.fedbizopps providing details. Those companies wishing to attend the pre-proposal conference shall submit their visit request to Mr. Tom Jerdan at 609-383-1973 by 10 May 2005 at 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  During the pre-proposal conference, individuals may ask questions concerning the RFP and the procurement process. After the pre-proposal conference, an amendment will be issued which documents questions and answers posed at the pre-proposal conference.

CUTOFF FOR SUBMISSION OF INTEREST
Interested Parties who wish to participate in the effort shall contact Ms. Sheila Roche via email at Sheila.Roche@dhs.gov by 10 May 2005 at 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time and provide the following on a single page (8 ½ X 11): Name, Address, Company Name, Email address, phone and fax number, CAGE Code, facility clearance information, and applicable quality assurance information (i.e. ISO 9001 or equivalent.) Please also indicate whether your company plans to attend the pre-proposal conference.

After the cutoff date, the Government reserves the right not to consider additional companies for the balance of the procurement process. The RFP and any associated amendments will only be provided to the interested parties.

Upon issuance of the modification, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements.  The proposed contract will be a combination firm fixed-price and indefinite quantity type contract.  This contract will replace an indefinite quantity type contract for lighting maintenance services awarded in 2002 for $500,000 maximum per year.  We will include information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) with the solicitation package.

<DESC>USAID/Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova anticipate an award of a five-year, performance based contract to support Financial Sector/Pension System Development (FD/PSD) in Ukraine.  The procurement will be through full and open competition.   

The purpose of USAID/Ukraine's Financial Sector/Pension System Development Project (FS/PSD) is to create a viable, effective financial sector which will promote economic growth and provide a sound private pension system. 

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector will provide small and medium enterprises with access to financing to through the capital markets. In addition, USAID’s experience has demonstrated that when commercial banks realize that small and medium sized enterprises are obtaining credit through the capital markets, it can stimulate a competitive response which generates increased commercial bank lending to SMEs.

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector is also critical to the successful implementation of Ukraine’s mandatory, defined-contribution, private accumulation pension system.  This second pillar pension system which is scheduled to go into effect in January 2007 requires that all employees contribute 7% of their salaries the private accumulation pension system.  This will total a minimum of over $ 1 billion in contributions per year.  Properly invested, these funds can become a major engine of economic growth. However, Ukraine’s nascent financial sector is completely inadequate to accommodate the investment of such sums of money.  It is essential and urgent that the challenges of developing a financial market be met in order to protect the pension contributions of Ukraine’s labor force and to guarantee retirement payments to the country’s current and future pensioners.

The challenges to financial sector development in Ukraine include:

Prudential regulation and oversight, particularly in securities market and other non-bank financial markets, do not protect the public, nor stimulate the growth of financial markets.

Financial statements are not a reliable indicator of company financial performance and condition, and the public generally does not have access to accurate, understandable information on financial intermediaries

The capital markets infrastructure remains shallow, with inadequate non-bank financial institutions and instruments, insurance products, equity and debt markets, money market funds, corporate and municipal bonds.

The anticipated contributions to the Second Pillar pension system will quickly exceed domestic investment opportunities, which could result in a concentration in government securities, which will not fuel economic growth, or in sub-standard, high risk domestic corporate stocks and bonds.

Lack of progress in meeting these challenges can be attributed primarily to a lack of a modern joint-stock company law which incorporates the OECD principles of corporate governance which protect investors, and weak, inefficient financial market regulators.

To meet the challenges, the FS/PSD has set the following objectives: 

Strengthen the capacities of the financial markets regulators to provide efficient and effective prudential regulation to the NBFI sector.

Broaden the range of financial instruments available for portfolio investment.

Strengthen the capacity of the pension system to enhance the operational capabilities of the pension fund providers, regulators, supervisors, and policy makers.

USAID anticipates awarding one (1) contract, The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541611. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) on or around December 15, 2004. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Questions must be directed to Raymond Jennings until December 3, 2004, and beginning December 6, 2004 to Svetlana Podeyko.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Compusearch Software Systems, Inc., 22685 Holiday Park Dr., STE 40, Sterling, VA 20166-6431 for the requirements specified herein under the authority provided in Federal Acquisition 13.106(b), as the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  SSA has a requirement to renew the following Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Module listed and described below as: (1) A real-time XML interface between Compusearch’s PRISM application and the Central Contract Registration(CCR) database. The interface must have the ability to add, validate and or refresh vendors from CCR directly through the PRISM application without logging into a separate database. This ability should become part of the PRISM Vendor Setup Module. There should be no need to reconfigure the current PRISM vendor file. (2) The link between CCR and PRISM will enable the ability to query data in CCR from within PRISM. (3) The interface will have the ability to import vendors from CCR through the PRISM Award Module. This interface requires changes to the proprietary software application, PRISM, which is owned by Compusearch , Inc. (4) The CCR maintenance will provide that the vendor updates to the PRISM CCR module as bugs are identified, and if and when any changes are made to the CCR database system which then require changes to the CCR PRISM interface. (5) The Maintenance coverage will provide both a helpdesk type of resource to SSA for issues with the CCR interface, and for updates, will provide software to SSA.

<DESC>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.     In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet current security requirements, federal energy goals, will be LEED certified, and will be designed in metric.   ** Pre-proposal Site Visit shall be held on Wednesday, September 28, 2005 @ 1:30pm in Room 501B in the Dr. A.

GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  A/E of record must be licensed in, and 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within, the State of Mississippi.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project is a modernization of the Dr. A.H. McCoy Federal Building, constructed in 1979.  It is a multi-tenant professional office building, 15 stories in height including a basement.  Containing approximately 422,600 gross square feet (gsf), approximately 383,600 rentable square feet (rsf) and 281,000 usable square feet, it is located in Jackson’s Central Business District on a 1.90 acre (82,853 square feet) site at 100 West Capitol Street.    This rehabilitation project will include sustainable design and engineering practices following the LEED NC format and will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides and standards.  Project tasks include verifying existing Program Development Study data, making the building more functionally and aesthetically appealing to other federal agencies, and minimizing future vacancies.  The project includes the design of a new security screening pavilion that is connected to, but separate from, the existing federal building.  The design of this addition should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the character of the existing federal building and surrounding context.  GSA will contract separately during the design phase for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services.  The CMc will be part of the project team during the design process to provide construction expertise; cost management services; market, labor and material cost information; and constructability reviews.  Upon exercise of the construction phase option, the CMc will provide complete construction services.  GSA will contract separately for Commissioning Services during both design and construction phases.  GSA will contract also separately with a Construction Manager as Agent to perform construction management services on the owners behalf.   During the design and construction phases there will be a formal partnering process to promote successful project development and execution, through voluntary commitments, to establish and accomplish agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties to their mutual benefit.    SCOPE OF WORK 
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professionals in  architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date). This facility will be renovated in order to extend the useful life of the building through retrofit and restoration of its interior and exterior.  The scope of work will include the following major work items:  Grounds and Approaches- design landscaping, hardscaping, irrigation, improve site security, ensure ADA accessibility; Building Structure- pressure wash exterior and replace all joint backing and sealant in the building pre-cast concrete panels and windows, design entry/security screening addition;  Interiors – demolish de-mountable partitions and replace with standard construction, coordinate interior design and finishes, design and plan interior signage/wayfinding; Accessibility – provide compliance in all public areas, restrooms, stair wells, and exterior approaches; Conveying Systems- modernize elevators, controls and assemblies; Plumbing Systems- replace all system components including water heaters, water closets, sinks and associated piping; HVAC Mechanical System - replace all components to include chillers and air distribution systems; Electrical Systems - replace electrical distribution, lightning protection, voice/data systems, lighting, emergency power, energy management systems and security systems; Life Safety – replace fire alarm controls, communication modules, smoke evacuation systems and all associated wiring.

The National Institutes of Health Department of Clinical Bioethics has a requirement for a Contractor to procure services to prepare a manuscript providing a a theoretical justification for public participation in priority setting for health.
The supplies and services herein are being procured un accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE TAKEN REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION. PLEASE SUBMIT PROPOSALS TO AMCGEE@CC.NIH.GOV BY COB 5 PM EST. ON 9/28/05.

Background: 
Maintaining the health of a population requires a myriad of expensive interventions. Along with medical care, a number of socio-economic factors contribute toward health. Given their complexity and cost, expenditures for health must necessarily be prioritized. Public involvement in health policy has encountered a number of obstacles.  When feeling well, most individuals find that the issues lack salience, so decisions tend to be influenced heavily by health care workers.  Patients may be frustrated by the complexity of information and rely on physicians and insurers to decide for them, trusting the services they need will be provided to them in the event of illness. At the community or organizational level, the lack of consumer understanding and involvement in policy making has been identified as a serious impediment to a market-based health care system with a solid moral foundation. Over the last 8 years the Section on Ethics and Health Policy of the Department of Clinical Bioethics at the NIH has engaged in a project to design, and use decision tools that involve members of the public in resource allocation decisions for health care and other interventions aimed at ameliorating health.
While this effort has involved the accomplishment of many technical tasks such as game design, software development, and data collection and analysis, we have focused insufficient attention on a theoretical justification for the idea that the ascertainment of the public’s perspective should lead to public participation in policy setting.

Contract Tasks to Be Performed:The Contractor, working closely with the project officer, will do the following work for the project:Review literature,Prepare a manuscript outline,Write a manuscript,Submit for publication and revise as necessary.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.  Please note this  document falls under "DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to  Department of Defense and DOD Contractors only to protect technical or  operational data..."

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<RESPDATE>013105

<DESC>USAID/Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova anticipate an award of a five-year, performance based contract to support Financial Sector/Pension System Development (FD/PSD) in Ukraine.  The procurement will be through full and open competition.   

The purpose of USAID/Ukraine's Financial Sector/Pension System Development Project (FS/PSD) is to create a viable, effective financial sector which will promote economic growth and provide a sound private pension system. 

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector will provide small and medium enterprises with access to financing to through the capital markets. In addition, USAID’s experience has demonstrated that when commercial banks realize that small and medium sized enterprises are obtaining credit through the capital markets, it can stimulate a competitive response which generates increased commercial bank lending to SMEs.

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector is also critical to the successful implementation of Ukraine’s mandatory, defined-contribution, private accumulation pension system.  This second pillar pension system which is scheduled to go into effect in January 2007 requires that all employees contribute 7% of their salaries the private accumulation pension system.  This will total a minimum of over $ 1 billion in contributions per year.  Properly invested, these funds can become a major engine of economic growth. However, Ukraine’s nascent financial sector is completely inadequate to accommodate the investment of such sums of money.  It is essential and urgent that the challenges of developing a financial market be met in order to protect the pension contributions of Ukraine’s labor force and to guarantee retirement payments to the country’s current and future pensioners.

The challenges to financial sector development in Ukraine include:

Prudential regulation and oversight, particularly in securities market and other non-bank financial markets, do not protect the public, nor stimulate the growth of financial markets.

Financial statements are not a reliable indicator of company financial performance and condition, and the public generally does not have access to accurate, understandable information on financial intermediaries

The capital markets infrastructure remains shallow, with inadequate non-bank financial institutions and instruments, insurance products, equity and debt markets, money market funds, corporate and municipal bonds.

The anticipated contributions to the Second Pillar pension system will quickly exceed domestic investment opportunities, which could result in a concentration in government securities, which will not fuel economic growth, or in sub-standard, high risk domestic corporate stocks and bonds.

Lack of progress in meeting these challenges can be attributed primarily to a lack of a modern joint-stock company law which incorporates the OECD principles of corporate governance which protect investors, and weak, inefficient financial market regulators.

To meet the challenges, the FS/PSD has set the following objectives: 

Strengthen the capacities of the financial markets regulators to provide efficient and effective prudential regulation to the NBFI sector.

Broaden the range of financial instruments available for portfolio investment.

Strengthen the capacity of the pension system to enhance the operational capabilities of the pension fund providers, regulators, supervisors, and policy makers.

USAID anticipates awarding one (1) contract, The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541611. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) on or around January 31, 2005. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Questions must be directed to Svetlana Podeyko at spodeyko@usaid.gov.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Answers below are provided in response to questions pertaining to the Request for Information (RFI) W81GYE-05-S-0003 posted on 9/16/05 . No further questions pertaining to the subject RFI will be accepted.   1. Is G3 or G6 sponsoring this requirement? It makes a difference in our response. Answer: G3 2. Is this part of the Container Management requirement that was put on hold for a while? Answer: No 3. Is there an incumbent for this requirement? Or is it a new requirement? If so, could you provide the incumbents name, contract #, contract value and dates? Answer: There is no incumbent contract.  This is a request for information only for market analy sis. 4. Is the response date of 23 Sept correct? Answer: Yes, responses are due by 3 p.m. on 23 Sep 05.  5. Is there a current program with an incumbent working on this or an associated requirement? Answer: No 6. Will the government provide a 1 week extension for the closing date on the RFI? Answer: No, this is time sensitive. 7. Is the government looking for an existing COTS Supply Chain system? Answer: COTS preferred due to quicker implementation and potentially lower costs, however; COTS is not a requirement. 8. The first paragraph state provide an automated system to track ocean shipments. Later in the document there is reference to track 24,000 domestic shipments. Are we to assume that the domestic shipments are the shipment movements from the Origin to the s eaport of embarkation --- or is the system actually intended to track domestic shipments, i.e. the New Cumberland to Ft Bragg shipments, that are no Ocean shipments? Answer: The system is to track domestic shipments that are the first leg of an ocean movem ent (e.g., Fort Hood unit move by rail to SPOE and then ocean movement to destination) and domestic movements that have origin/destination in CONUS. 9. Who are the expected users of this system? Answer: G3 10.  What is the definition of a shipment? For example, is a shipment a container or a single package. As a follow-up, if a shipment is not a container, then what is the relationship to a pallet and container? Answer:  For containerized shipments, shipment  is the conveyance (e.g., truck trailer, container).  For breakbulk shipments (normally vehicles), shipment is the piece. 11.  What is real-time NIPR? Our understanding is the NIPR is the NIPRNET. Is this true?  Answer:  NIPR is NIPRNET. 12.  Is the system boundary around the back-end? That is, the system being addressed does not include the actual collection of information (e.g. RFID). It is the IT infrastructure to interface to collection elements, store the data and make it available. Answer:  True, looking for a system that accesses available data.  13. How many system users are projected and at how many locations are they? By system users we mean, people who will access the system to get status information, reports, etc. Number of people and locations has not been determined.  Answer:  Number of peop le and locations has not been determined. Answers to both will be multiple. 14. You requested information on number of people to provide O&M support. We are assuming (based on our Question #3 above) that O&M is limited to the IT infrastructure as opposed to maintaining and operating the field collection components. Is that true? Answer:  True, O&M is limited to IT infrastructure.  15. You mention interfaces to our legacy system. Can you provide some examples? We are aware of some potential system such as WPS BPS, but would like to know what other you envision.  Answer:  WPS, IBS, GFM are examples of legacy systems. 16. Is it possible to have an extension until September 29, 2005?  The deadline for questions (4 working days form release of the Sources Sought on September 16th) is Sept. 22nd which gives less than 24 hours to incorporate the answers into the submission due on Sept 23rd?  Answer: Unfortunately, no extension.  We are trying to provide estimates on a very tight timeline.  17. Should this RFI response address an automated software system? Or should it include the provision of infrastructure?  Answer: Both.  Ultimately, we would envision a contractor tying into systems of record that have our tracking data.  18. Is this proposal to address provisioning of services and/or software? Answer:  Both 19. Should the response address the communication (software) systems?  Answer: Yes  20. Is the provider expected to build interfaces into legacy systems? How many legacy systems?Answer: Yes.  Legacy systems are WPS, IBS, and GFM.  What Operating Systems do the legacy systems utilize? Answer: Unix HP Unix and Sun Solaris 21. Based on the wireless requirement, are there security requirements? (FIPS140, encryption/decryption) Answer: Yes.  Must meet DoD standards.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS only.  The purpose of the Sources Sought Synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources for Design Excellence in public Architectural-Engineering for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Phase services for the GT Leland Federal Building in Houston, Texas.  The GT Leland building is located at  1919 Smith Street in the Central Business District of Houston, Texas.  The building was constructed in 1983 as a speculative office building and purchased by the General Service Administration (GSA) in 1986.  It contains 496,286 gross square feet and is 22-stories tall with a basement and an adjacent six-story parking structure connected by an outdoor plaza, breezeway and underground tunnel.  With an occupancy rate of 98%, the building provides a strong Federal presence to downtown Houston.  The building population is currently 841 occupants.  In addition to the 373 structured parking spaces are 94 surface parking spaces.  GSA proposes to repair the existing plaza, breezeway, electrical vault and garage to correct cracks, utilization, security and drainage issues, replace all window units with new insulated and low-E windows, upgrade the fire protection system, replace chiller valve parts and upgrade air-handling units, complete elevator modernization excluding new controllers, clean and re-caulk building exterior and apply protective sealant, upgrade main entry and building lobby, replace concealed-spline ceilings, replace mercury vapor lighting fixtures, upgrade common area restrooms for ADA compliance, replace drinking fountains, provide ADA compliant van accessible parking space in surface in surface lot, install ADA compliant elevator at breezeway and tunnel connection, and provide ADA modifications in the existing parking garage.  GSA Greater Southwest Region, Solicitation No. GS-07P-05-URC-5012.  The Estimated Construction Cost Range is $15,000,000 to $25,000,000.  The scope of services will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS).  The design shall include sustainable features.  The design shall also include the GSA design standards for secure facilities.  The building will be completely occupied during the entire construction phase.  Therefore, the construction shall be phased so that the tenant agencies can complete its routine mission during normal business hours without interruption.  In developing the project team, the A-E firms are advised that at least 70% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the State of Texas.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expenses, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants.  Interested A-E firms must have performed on at least four to six similar repair and alterations projects, completed within the past 10 years and a minimum of three projects must be multi-story buildings (at least 3-stories) with a total construction cost exceeding $5,000,000.  The design work for the projects described by responding firms shall have scope which clearly demonstrate competence in engineering design for office spaces, and mechanical, electrical, and architectural handicap accessibility (or ADA) design similar in scope to that identified for the GT Leland Federal Building.  Interested parties who meet the above requirements are requested to submit a one-page letter to Carrie Haman, Contracting Officer, no later than May 18, 2005.  Letters can be submitted via e-mail to carrie.haman@gsa.gov or by facsimile to (817) 978-7194.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought.  The Coast Guard has a requirement to puchase Caterpillar parts in support of various Coast Guard vessels.  Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to the Caterpillar parts are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Caterpillar Engine Company.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Caterpillar parts are available from one source only.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning thier capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a compeititve procurement.  The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1)Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer, or 2)Complete and current engineering  data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics).  The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered. It is the Government belief that only Caterpillar Engine Company, the manufacturer of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 5 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a RFP.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicted.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capabillity to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.   Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Patricia Johnson at the address indicated above.  See Numbered Note 22

<DESC>The dental laboratory requires renovation to support Dental Care Optimization (DCO) operations. The lab will be required to support a workload of 6 technicians and 2 dentists. The lab will require extensive renovations that will be provided by MDG resources.  A vendor is needed to provide and install casework units to support DCO operations. Casework will require power, gas & air outlets to support laboratory production requirements. Also 4 areas will require large stainless steel sinks. The workstations where production is conducted is divided into 3 areas consisting of 9 individual workstations that require access to overhead lighting, exhaust, ( to capture dust particles generated during fabrication) propane gas, air and drawers deep enough to hold supplies/equipment.. Electrical outlets will be required to run the full length of the workstations. Each station should have easy access to a minimum of 4 outlets. Cabinets must be durable and heat resistant. Fabrication includes the use of open flames for long durations. resting on the cabinet countertops. Laboratory fabrication is a unique process that is similar to a machine shop but has the same infection control protocol associated with a patient care environment. Items are actually removed from oral cavities and require disinfecting before technicians make adjustments or staining/repair of appliances. This area is the only location where this process is completed. Vendor's ability to quickly assemble/install and make operational is critical.

Summary:
1.	This amendment hereby revises the CLIN 0001 scope of work to include the requirement for underlayment.  
2.	The 12,000 SF does NOT include ‘underlayment’ + ‘Type III’.  This approach would only produce a total Type III coverage of 6000 SF.  The total SF after installation shall include both underlayment and Type III so that final project completion shall result in 12,000 SF of Type III installed.
0001 – Provide and Install Cosmetic Polymeric (Monolithic Seamless) Deck Covering – Type III:  Existing deck covering will be removed down to bare metal surface by SHIP’S FORCE.  Prepare and prime deck surface in accordance with GENSPEC Section 631.  Install approved underlayment to level surface and cover any raised areas across the surface area.  Install new cosmetic polymeric (monolithic seamless) deck covering material throughout entire areas specified iaw military specification Mil Spec MIL-D-24613 Type III.  Installation of new deck covering material shall be in accordance with manufacturers specifications and detailed requirements stated in GENSPEC Section 634.  Cove base effect shall be iaw manufacturers instructions or as directed by GENSPEC 634, which ever is greater.  Apply two coats of sealer iaw manufacturers specifications to complete the installation and promote durability.  Color and pattern of new deck covering material shall be specified by ships representative.  Contractor shall maintain completion log in order to track contract ‘ceiling’ of specified square footage.  The area of decking measures approximately 12,000 SF as follows: (clean RFQ and Scope of Work spreadsheet copy is available upon request via email at scott.wilkins@navy.mil).

This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for possible Ship / Contractor pre-performance meetings and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Contractor geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.
