<DESC>The Agency of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), through the Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award a 12 month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the National Business Group, 50 F Street, NW., Suite 600, Washington, DC 20001.  The anticipated date of award is August 28, 2006.

Historically, EAPs functioned as the corporate resource for linking underperforming employees with community resources to resolve personal issues affecting work performance. However,
due to a number of factors, including managed care, EAP’s focus shifted and the program became less valued for addressing the conflict between personal and performance related issues. 

More specifically, the CMHS sees the need to develop a business model and accompanying processes employers can use to create and/or reengineer their EAP. This project would represent a new business case for how EAPs can be strategically positioned to integrate with number of corporate benefits and human resources into a common approach for managing employee productivity and achieve a positive return on investment. Furthermore, this effort would result in an employer toolkit that would include the following components:

1.  Assessment 
A summary of tool(s) needed and/or available to assess current environment and the gaps between current performance and “optimal” (or expected) performance - i.e. current practice patterns vs. optimal approaches, service delivery models, and reimbursement schemes. From this, a description of the current state of EAP can be developed.
 
2. Data Collection and Analysis
Methods that can be used to: (1) identify and quantify the direct and indirect employment costs (i.e., disability, presenteeism, organization of work,) and (2) analyze and evaluate the impact of these costs drivers at the individual, group and organizational levels.

3. Organizational Structure:
Organizational models to effectively address the “findings” and “recommendations”
 
4.  Implementation
Steps or building programs (i.e., RFIs, RFPs, internal training models, internal sponsorship methods, operating budgets, staffing models, etc)

5.  Monitoring and Evaluation
Approaches to assess effectiveness and reporting results (i.e. balanced scorecard)

The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and supplies, and perform the work set forth below.

All work under this project shall be monitored by the Government Project Officer (GPO).

All reports, statistics, or tables produced under this project shall be the property of the Federal government, which includes the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) and the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  SAMHSA or CMHS may utilize, print, or disseminate such material without further charge.

No other articles or publications which rely substantially on materials produced under this project shall be published by either party without prior consultation and approval.

The contractor shall meet with the GPO and other CMHS/SAMHSA staff in order to determine the best approach for accomplishing the tasks covered by this contract.  GPO and other CMHS/SAMHSA staff will review plan for consistency with the Federal Action Agenda. Modify the work plan in response to comments provided by the GPO.

The Contractor shall perform a gap analysis of the current state of EAP services and current research and approaches for delivering effective EAP services.

The Contractor shall create a user’s group of 20-25 Fortune 500 members to facilitate inter-company development and implementation discussions. Members of this group will be
identified in the first month of the project.  Quarterly meetings will be conducted with this group. Two meetings will be in-person  and two will be conducted by interactive web cast. These will be full workday meetings.

The Contractor shall develop an employer’s toolkit to help member companies methodically address implementing the effective practices identified as described in the paragraphs above. The Toolkit will be complete by the end the eleventh month of the project and presented to the staff of the Center for Mental Health Services for review and comment.

the Contractor shall publish and distribute the toolkit to its membership; post the toolkit in the public domain.  Conduct a media campaign to announce its findings and recommendations.
Conduct a workshop with leading healthcare consultants to fully acquaint them with the findings and recommendations.

Additionally, the Contractor shall develop a Webinar to present the Toolkit’s findings and recommendations relative to the project’s findings and recommendations. The Webinar
will include Contractor staff and three user group members.

Conduct briefings for GPO and identified SAMHSA officials on the results of Tasks 3, 4, and 5; make changes to the draft documents in response to comments and recommendations; submit
revised final report.

The contractor shall deliver the following:
Meet with the GPO, and development of workplan for Employee Assistance Programs
(Tasks 1)  -  4 to12 weeks after start of contract
Submit draft report describing:  1)  Approval of Products from meeting of User’s Group Committee -  (Task 2)  -  24 weeks after start of contract

<SUBJECT>D--Notice of intent to award noncompetitive procurement - software development to create tools for the processing of high-rate Global Positioning System data.
<SOLNBR>06WRQQ0125
<RESPDATE>082306
<ARCHDATE>08082007
<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Northern California Earthquake Hazards Program (USGS), has a requirement for the development of software to be used in the processing of high-rate Global Positioning System (GPS) data for fault monitoring. A growing number of continuously-operating GPS stations are recording high-rate (e.g. 1 Hz) data.  These observations, which provide direct measurement of ground displacement during an earthquake and temporally-dense measurements of the immediate post-seismic period, will play a crucial role in meeting two major goals of the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program: 1) monitoring deformation and providing data for rapid earthquake response, and 2) carrying out scientific research on underlying geophysical processes in order to improve our hazard forecasting ability.  The USGS has positioned itself as a leader in the field of GPS geodesy for natural hazards monitoring and mitigation, and has established state-of-the-art GPS networks across the United States and its territories.  Data from these networks are typically recorded at 30-second intervals and averaged over 24 hours to obtain daily positions.  Such practices are not well-suited for detecting and characterizing short-term transient processes, including earthquake shaking, coseismic offsets, and postseismic deformation, as well as volcanic events and catastrophic landslide motion.  The standard processing strategies used for daily GPS measurements cannot be applied to high-rate data. Recent advances in GPS signal processing have made it possible for high-rate positions to be determined in near-real-time.  However, currently the USGS does not have the expertise to utilize high-rate GPS data to their fullest, but rather must rely on processing done by others or using proprietary software that is prohibitively expensive, is not open-source, and cannot easily be altered to suit specific needs.   The USGS therefore has a requirement to develop open-source, freely-available tools for implementing near-real-time monitoring as well as obtaining high-quality absolute positions in post-processing using high-rate GPS data. The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) to the University of Colorado at Boulder.  Work by Dr. Kristine Larson's research group at the University of Colorado at Boulder has resulted in techniques for obtaining high-quality absolute displacement histories from high-rate GPS data using a method called modified sidereal filtering to mitigate multipath, a major error source in high-rate data.  Implementing software tools based on these techniques at GPS processing centers within the USGS will allow USGS scientists to conduct detailed investigations into the mechanics of transient deformation, as well as develop near-real-time monitoring and warning systems for hazard mitigation purposes.  Larson's research group is at the forefront of the high-rate GPS field, and is the only group with which the USGS can develop open-source, freely-available tools for implementing near-real-time monitoring as well as obtaining high-quality absolute positions in post-processing using high-rate GPS data.   Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these supplies shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This is NOT an RFQ.  As required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.102(a)(1), Request for Quotation 06WRQQ0125, resulting from this synopsis, will be made available through the GPE on or about 23 August 2006.  Unless competitive opportunities have been identified as a result of this synopsis, the forthcoming solicitation will solicit a quotation only from the source identified above; competitive quotations will not be considered. For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer, Jeff Caravelli, at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov. NAICS code 541511.  Numbered Note 26 applies.

<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to enter into a contract for the  development of new or improved influenza virus Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic tests to an advanced stage development and facilitate early commercialization. Products for influenza testing should have high sensitivity and specificity, along with reliability, ease of use, low-cost, stability, and practicality for point-of-care use. These tests should have capability to detect all influenza viruses and initially differentiate influenza A (H5N1) viruses from other influenza A viruses, and be sufficiently quick and simple to provide preliminary results to healthcare providers within 30 minutes of collecting samples from persons with influenza-like illness.  The candidate test design should also permit capability to expand or modify biomarkers that are detected to enable adaptation for other novel influenza A viruses that may cause a pandemic.  Because of the uncertainty associated with appropriate sampling for pre-pandemic detection of novel influenza A viruses such as H5N1, the test system should also be adaptable to multiple sample types.  The completion of the work proposed in the contract should lead to availability of a diagnostic test product that provides improved sensitivity for detection of seasonal human influenza viruses in upper respiratory tract specimens, and also to differentiate H5N1 causing current human infections from seasonal human influenza viruses in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.  Because other novel influenza A viruses may also cause human infections at any time, the product must be easily modified or adapted to detect those emerging viruses.  Independently and not as an agent of the government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the government as needed to perform the work described above.  Incremental funding for a cost-reimbursement type contract will be provided to support this effort.  A pre-proposal meeting/conference will be held prior to the due date for the receipt of proposals.  The date, time, and location for the pre-proposal meeting will be included in the solicitation.  RFP 2006-Q-08478 will be available on or about May 15, 2006.  The solicitation can be accessed through the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov.  Any amendment issued to the solicitation will also be made available at the same website.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding this RFP on the FedBizOpps website.  Full and open competition will be used in soliciting offers for this requirement.  This procurement is not set-aside for small business.  All responsible sources may summit a proposal, which will be considered by the Agency.  Any questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Jeff Miller at afx2@cdc.gov.

Other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.  Space must be situated in the central business district of Billings, MT.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.

<DESC>The purpose of the AIRSS PRDA effort is to perform system definition, allocate technical requirements document (TRD) requirements to the various subsystems, and assess whether the requirements allocation is supportable with components available by Key Decision Point B (KDP-B) in December 2007. AIRSS key risk mitigation priorities are schedule, cost, and performance.  AIRSS primary mission is to provide DSP-like strategic and tactical missile warning and missile defense.  The effort will be approximately 18 months in duration and composed of three distinct phases: System Requirements Review (SRR), System Design Review (SDR), and Solution Refinement and Action Item Closeout.  This contract will be a new start in FY07.  While this PRDA effort may lead directly to the development of requirements for the objective system for the AIRSS program, the system development contract will be a FAR 15 full and open competition.  The system development contract award is planned for June 2008.
The solicitation will be attached to this notice.

The solicitation is issued for Full and Open Competition. Proposed Issue Date:   August 22, 2006 Title of Project:  Low Water Mitigation and Other Construction  IDIQ Construction Contract Description:  The work of this contract consists of:   A.  The work of this contract consists primarily of performing work associated with the significant lowering of Lake Mead water levels due to recent drought conditions.  This work includes (1) The demolition of existing asphalt boat launch ramps, replacing them with concrete launch ramps, constructing new launch ramps and making repairs as necessary to keep existing launch ramps functioning at low water; (2) Constructing new roads and parking areas to new launch ramps, Repairing storm damage, grading existing roads, beaches and parking areas; (3) Extending flood dikes, breakwaters and dock anchors; and (4) Other mitigation related work. The minimum size task order will be $10,000, and the maximum size will be $5,000,000.  A task order may consist of numerous individual projects and the minimum size of a project will be $10,000.  The construction periods of up to two projects may overlap one another.  The Contractor will be notified at least 14 calendar days in advance of a project start date.  A separate Notice To Proceed shall be issued for each project. B.  Launch Ramp Work:  The possible locations for the work may consist of one or more of seven (7) existing launch ramp locations and the possibility of three (3) new locations, all on Lake Mead.  The primary work items will consist of demolition and removal of the existing asphalt boat launch ramps and replacement with concrete boat launch ramps as shown on the drawings.  See ramp locations and approximate square yardage below. The quantities used are intended only to approximate work that may be ordered at each location and to be used as a basis for establishing unit prices.  The individual task orders will include specific designs and actual quantities at the time the work order is executed.  The length of the launch ramp construction will vary depending on the actual water level of Lake Mead at the time the work order is executed.  1.  Launch ramps will be extended as close as possible to the existing water level at the time of construction. Contractor will be expected to plan their operations to coordinate with this low water level and construct the maximum length of ramp possible at all locations.  2.  Underwater construction, cofferdams or dewatering are not anticipated under this contract and unit pricing should not include these methods for accomplishing the launch ramp work.  If underwater construction, cofferdams and/or dewatering are determined to be necessary by the contracting officer's representative for accomplishment of work under a particular work order, then an equitable adjustment to the unit price will be determined prior to beginning the work.  3.  Work orders issued under this contract may also involve other work items associated with the individual launch ramp locations, including but not limited to concrete curbing, concrete sidewalk, anchor points, breakwaters, courtesy docks, repairs to keep existing ramp functioning, lighting, and accessible loading platforms.  4.  Location and approximate existing launch Ramp replacement total square yardage (based on water elevations continuing to recede as projected) for the next five years is as follows: 	1.  Callville Bay, Nevada - 6,200 square yards 	2.  Echo Bay, Nevada - 16,900 square yards 	3.  Hemenway Harbor, Nevada - 25,400 square yards 	4.  Boulder Harbor, Nevada - 39,400 square yards 	5.  Overton Beach, Nevada - 4,000 square yards 	6.  South Cove, Arizona - 1,300 square yards 	7.  Temple Bar, Arizona - 38,000 square yards 5.  Contractor shall plan their work so that approximately one-half of the launch ramp shall be maintained open to the public for boat launching during construction. Contractor will not be allowed to work on the launch ramp during weekends and holidays without written permission from the Contracting Officer's Representative.  During weekends and holidays Contractor shall make as much of the existing ramp available for public launching as is possible. 6.  As water levels continue to recede some existing launch ramps may become unusable.  When this happens it will become necessary to construct new launch ramps, access and parking at new locations.    Areas where it is anticipated that new launch ramps will need to be built are Callville Bay, Government Wash, Stewarts Point and South Cove. C. Road/Grading, Flood Dikes and Miscellaneous Work: This work includes grading and repairing existing roads/parking lots, grading new parking lots, repairing storm damage to roads, repairing damage to drainage structures, extending flood control dikes and breakwaters. Storm damage to roads may require road repair work upon short notice at any location within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.  All construction work is within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Clark County, Nevada, and Mohave County, Arizona.

Many eukaryote (human, mouse, etc) proteins express as insoluble aggregates in both E. coli and baculovirus systems. These insoluble aggregates represent a success for expression, but can not be used for most of the needs of NIEHS researchers.  TheBarofold PreEMIT Trademark Instrument System provides a process that will allow NIEHS researchers to quickly and efficiently refold these aggregates into useful proteins. The Barofold technology represents a new method for refolding these proteins to enable researchers to refold the proteins quickly and in high concentration, something that no other known refolding approach can do.  TheBarofold PreEMIT Trademark Instrument System includes training and 20 hours of technical/scientific consulting, HiPER-FOLD Starter Kit, HiPER-Fold Redox Screen Kit, HiPer-Fold Protein Solubililty Kit, HiPER-Fold Additive Screen Kit, and ProVENT Caissons.  The associated U.S. Patents owed by Barold are: 6,489,45 (High Pressure Refolding of Protein Aggregates and Inclusion Bodies) and 7,064,192 (High Pressure Refolding of Protein Aggregates and Inclusion Bodies).  Additional patents are pending for further applications of this technology and for the design use of ProVENT Caissons.   Any firm believing itself capable of providing this requirement may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Paula Pier at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Barofold, Inc.  The NAICS Code/Size is 339111/500EM.  This purchase is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Paula Pier via email pierp@niehs.nih.gov.*****

The systems will be modified to include the following upgrades:  - be capable of performing automated, speciated Hg measurements from combustion processes from at pollution control inlet and outlet location - be capable of periodic, user defined, automated quality assurance/quality control checks that assess zero/span instrument drift and system bias using self-contained Hg0 gaseous standard calibration/calibration check source(s) - be able to control and automate measurement frequency from each sampling location, including independent control of the frequency of total and speciated Hg measurements -be equipped with 3 complete heated sampling probe, filter, pumping, and speciation systems - be equipped with Wet/Dry converter/sample conditioning system - be equipped with 3 heated (360F?), 50ft, PFA sample lines Probes: - be equipped with inertial probe sample interface systems for sampling in high PM environments (3) - each inertial probe/Hg CEMS must be capable of automated sample flow rate control - each inertial probe/Hg CEMS must be capable of maintaining sample flow at constant flow rates ranging from 5-50 lpm (? 0.5 lpm) - each inertial probe/Hg CEMS must be capable of measuring and monitoring sample flow rate accuractely and precisely (?5% of sample flow?) -   each inertial probe/Hg CEMS must be capable of introducing the Hg0 calibration gases at multiple probe locations including as a mimimum the probe tip, immediately upstream of the inertial filter, and downstream of the inertial filter Hg0 calibration systems - the Hg0 gas generators must be upgraded, including factory calibration and check out to ensure that they are comparable - the Hg0 gas generators must be capable of delivering gaseous concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 250 ?g/m3 at flow rates ranging from =2lpm to =10lpm Since PS Analytical holds proprietary rights to this EPA-owned system, it is the only known source that can provide the equipment and services needed to complete the governments requirements. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before Wednesday, August 23, 2006 at 10:00 AM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The applicable NAICS code is 334516. Parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2107, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov).

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a requirement for a contractor to provide specialized and timely non-personal expert “advisory and assistance” services, including analytical and research services as they may be required, to support the BBG in the performance of its entire worldwide   multimedia broadcasting public diplomacy mission in the most effective, timely, and efficient manner practicable in a very competitive global marketplace.  The contractor must have recent pertinent experience in such functions as providing strategic (mid-term or long-term) and tactical (short-term) advice and assistance on planning, developing, testing, and evaluating unique radio programming, television (TV) programming, and other multimedia products, services, and methodologies (including but not limited to the effective use of computer technology in broadcasting and digital radio and television production techniques), as well as the use and development of programming on medium wave, FM, and shortwave broadcasting to attract substantial target audiences, as determined by the BBG.  The contractor may also be requested by the BBG to perform ad-hoc special projects and/or make special presentations to the BBG. Because of the specialized nature (i.e., technical, business, cultural, logistical, and politica1 considerations) and the necessary timeliness of the contractor’s performance of the above-stated expert “advisory and assistance” services in support of the BBG during their development and implementation of the BBG’s multimedia programming efforts, the BBG intends to non-competitively award a negotiated firm-fixed-price contract to Bert Kleinman Programming, Inc. (BKP), 16832 Edgar Street Pacific Palisades, CA  90272, for this specialized work on the basis of BKP’s unique technical, business, and other qualifications and recent pertinent experience in radio, television, and multimedia news, information, and music programming for mass audiences, BKP’s known capability to successfully meet the BBG’s overall time schedule for its multimedia programming efforts, and BKP’s comprehensive international broadcasting qualifications and experience.  The term of this proposed contract is for one base-year, with a single one-year option, subject to annual funding availability.  BKP is the only responsible source known to the BBG that has demonstrated in-depth specialized business and technical knowledge (including, but not limited to, the above-stated radio and TV methodologies), and current radio, television, and multimedia experience with mass audience programming that is critical to the contractor's ability to perform the above-summarized work in a high quality and timely manner for the BBG.  Such unique BKP capability is due, in part, to BKP’s experience in dealing with the BBG and other organizations in addressing complex radio, television, and multimedia program planning, development, and implementation issues, including the Middle East and Russia.  The Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this proposed procurement is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2), 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(l), that states: “When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.”  This Public Notice of the BBG’s intent to non-competitively procure BKP’s expert advisory and assistance services is NOT a request for competitive price quotations or proposals.  However, other interested individuals or firms may express to the U.S. Government their interest in and detailed capabilities to perform the above-stated non-personal expert advisory and assistance services.  Any such written expressions of interest AND accompanying detailed written statements of existing technical, business, and other capabilities must be received by the Government (BBG) Contracting Officer (CO) within fifteen (15) calendar days of the GSA’s publication of this Public Notice in order to be considered.  The Government will not accept oral or incomplete submissions.  A final determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement, based upon any responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received from interested persons or firms responding to this Public Notice will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any submissions or questions regarding this Public Notice shall be submitted in writing to the Government (BBG) Contracting Officer (CO), Myria Carpenter, via E-mail at mecarpen@ibb.gov, and the interested person or firm making the submission and/or asking the question shall confirm the BBG-CO’s receipt of any such submissions and/or questions by telephonically contacting the BBG-CO at (202) 205-2498.  This Public Notice is not a RFQ, RFP, or IFB.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to contract, on a sole source basis, with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) of the University of Colorado, Boulder, CO for the Implementation Phase of the X-Ray Sensor (XRS) and Extreme Ultra Violet Sensor (EUVS) instruments that are to fly on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) R series of weather satellites.	The XRS instrument detects the beginning, duration, and magnitude of solar X-ray flares for use in space weather forecasting.  The EUVS monitors the solar EUV flux in the 5-127nm range to provide data to assess affects on radio communication, navigation and satellite drag.	LASP is the only known source.  LASP and its team member Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center (LMATC) Palo Alto, CA, were the only source to respond to NASA's request for proposal for the Formulation Phase of the XRS, EUVS and Solar Ultra Violet Imager (SUVI) requirement, and receive award for that phase. The combination of the XRS/EUVS and SUVI make up the Solar Imaging Suite (SIS) instruments. To be considered a viable source for Implementation of the XRS and EUVS instruments, a non-Formulation Phase contractor must demonstrate that it has a comparable level of instrument design maturity. To date, no contractor, other than LASP, has demonstrated that it has performed the equivalent of the Formulation Phase requirements and achieved a comparable level of instrument design maturity.   The statutory authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  See note 22.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 23, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to contract, on a sole source basis, with Lockheed Martin, Advanced Technology Center (LMATC) Palo Alto, CA for the Implementation Phase of the Solar Ultra Violet Imager (SUVI) instruments that are to fly on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) R series of weather satellites.  The SUVI instrument provides a broadband imaging in the soft X-Ray to EUV wavelength range to monitor the entire dynamic range of solar X-ray features.  LMATC is the only known source.  LMATC and its team member Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) Boulder, CO, were the only source to respond to NASA's request for proposal for the Formulation Phase of the SUVI, X-Ray Sensor (XRS) and Extreme Ultra Violet Sensor (EUVS) requirement, and receive award for that phase. The combination of the SUVI and the XRS/EUVS make up the Solar Imaging Suite (SIS) instruments.  To be considered a viable source for Implementation of the SUVI instruments, a non-Formulation Phase contractor must demonstrate that it has a comparable level of instrument design maturity. To date, no contractor, other than LMATC, has demonstrated that it has performed the equivalent of the Formulation Phase requirements and a comparable level of instrument design maturity.   The statutory authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  See note 22.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 23, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

Description:

Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services:

The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services related to the modernization and renovation at the Minton-Capehart Federal Building, located in downtown Indianapolis at 575 North Pennsylvania, Indiana.  Built in 1974, the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is a freestanding six story building with a Ground Floor below grade, with a mechanical mezzanine above grade, and a penthouse above the core area of the Sixth Floor.  Attached to the building is a two level parking facility.  It is the intention in this design and construction renovation project is to respect the Modern Era “Brutalist” Design of the building, even though the building is not yet currently listed on the National Historic Register.  The estimated construction cost ranges is $19 million to $30 million.  The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin in April 2009.

The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes the base contract for Pre-Construction Phase Services with the Construction Phase Services of the project evaluated as a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) option.  This will be a firm, fixed-price contract.  A firm, fixed-price for the general construction services will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction phase option.

Project Summary:

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, this project will be executed based on GSA’s Design and Construction Excellence Program.  The scope of this project, as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation work will most likely included, but not be limited to, the following:  (1)  refurbish the air-handling units for greater airflow to provide the recommended minimum amount of fresh air for each occupant and improve the total air circulation; (2)  replace the fiberglass branch distribution ductwork and diffusers to handle greater airflows and to eliminate contamination from glass fiber in the environmental air, (3)  replace the stair pressurization fans with larger fans that will produce the necessary pressures and airflows; (4)  provide a new direct digital control (DDC) temperature control system for energy efficiency; (5)  provide additional commissioning of the system and other improvements for LEED-EB certification; (6)  utilize the existing dry standpipe risers in the stairs as a part of a new sprinkler system; (7)  provide sprinkler protection extending from the mains to each space in the building; (8)  provide a new fire pump and jockey pump, installed in the Ground Floor mechanical room, to boost the pressure for the new sprinkler system; as well as (9)  provide new lay-in ceilings, repair hard ceilings and replace lighting throughout the building with modular wiring and automatic controls for lower maintenance costs, easier adds and moves, as well as provide for greater energy efficiency.  Possible additional design work (Option1 1) and additional construction work (part of Option 2) may include the repair of the existing parking garage structure attached to the building, as well as the build out/backfill of anticipated vacant space on the sixth floor for a particular tenant agency.  The entire project will incorporate GSA’s design standards for secure facilities, conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements.

The building will be fully occupied during construction.  All building systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption of occupants.  Construction will be accomplished with a combination of after normal business hour work (6pm-6am, weekends, and holidays) and swing space.

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the General Services Administration – GSA).    The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor, the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project.

Selection of the CMc firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value Trade-off process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The CMc shall work with the A/E, their design consultants, the Third Party Commissioning Contractor, and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc will be brought onto the project during the design phase, during which he/she can be effective at controlling design-related costs and develop construction sequencing activities.  During the design phase, the CMc will be responsible for developing construction cost estimates and costs related to future project consultants.  For the Pre-Construction Phase Services, GSA intends to have the CMc perform other services including evaluating design concepts, reviewing designs, evaluating cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, reviewing phases of work, resolving problems, participating in value engineering (VE) exercises, preparing commissioning plans as determined by a 3rd party commissioning agent, working with a LEED consultant to prepare for LEED certification, conducting constructability reviews, developing subcontractor and supplier interests, identifying long-lead items, and performing administrative and other services.  The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, delineate necessary actions, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.

CMc services for this project during the actual construction, Construction Phase Services (Option 2), will include, but may not be limited to, the following: administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc’s internal personnel or under sub-contract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, and other required supplemental LEED services.  The CM shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the project.  During the construction phase, the CMc will be responsible for providing warranties on all completed work and for providing construction materials in a timely manner to complete the job on schedule and under budget.

Small Business Participation:  This is a negotiated procurement open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31.0 million.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small businesses including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, small disadvantaged businesses and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation.  In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA.  Please refer to the SBA website at www.sba.gov for details. 

Joint Ventures:  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate a contract with Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on a sole source basis for logistical and technical support for the Institute’s Division of Intramural Research (DIR).  The DIR, NINDS has operated several of its labs including the Laboratory of Neurobiology and Laboratory of Neurochemistry at an outside marine laboratory on a part-time basis over the last 18 years.  A five-year (base year plus four option years)continuation of this program beginning May 2007 is anticipated.  The program will support important research in neural cells and neural cell membranes, neuronal signaling, and short and long-term memory mechanisms.  It is based on the need in the NINDS, DIR for live squid and other marine invertebrates to investigate the cellular function underlining central nervous system function.  MBL will provide a science based working environment at a marine facility with capabilities to collect and hold the Atlantic squid, Loligo Peallii, and other marine invertebrates.  Support will include technical services in the areas of mariculture, biochemistry, and computer programming.  Logistical support will be required in the areas of squid collection, shop services, photo and graphics, and laboratory space.  MBL has the prerequisite skilled personnel, technical experience, resources and facilities necessary for continued performance of this acquisition.  MBL is considered to be the only responsible source for this work pursuant to 41 USC 253c(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Organizations that believe that they can provide these services should submit their capabilities currently in place to the Contracting Officer at the above address within 45 days from the date of this announcement. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in obtaining this support make competition of this requirement not feasible.  This is not a formal solicitation or an announcement for a Request for Proposals (RFP).  See Note 22 and Note 26.

<DESC>The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is currently in the process of revising the Standard Review Plan (SRP) (NUREG-0800) in anticipation of the receipt of multiple combined operation license (COL) applications starting in 2007.  The SRP sections refer to Regulatory Guides (RGs), some of which have not been updated in decades.  NRC is working to commonly prioritize and align the RGs based on the anticipated need for updated versions to be consistent with the revised SRP and support COL application development and staff review.

The objective of this acquisition is to acquire technical support for the review, prioritization and revision, as needed, of 418 RGS.  Specific tasks will be defined through the issuance of individual Task Orders.  In general, the contractor shall – (1) review/identify/prioritize the RGs which will include reviewing each RG against current regulations, draft or proposed regulations, and state-of-the-art methods and information to identify appropriate revisions and then providing NRC with a prioritized list of the RGs which need revision; and (2) provide the technical support for revising the RGs which will include evaluating existing technical information to support the RG revision, making presentations (e.g., public meetings, Advisory committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), and the Committee to Review Generic Requirements (CRGR)), responding to comments/questions (e.g., from the public, ACRS, and CRGR) and providing adequate documentation to support the revision of the RGs.

NRC intends to award a task order contract.  The period of performance is 36 months with one (1) one-year option period.  

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about July 31, 2006.  The RFP will be available solely through the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov and any future solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions.

<DESC>The National Pandemic Plan of 2005 designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness and response. Following the issuance of the HHS Pandemic Plan of 2005, the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was assigned the responsibility for the advanced development, establishment of surge capacity, and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as diagnostics, vaccines  and antiviral drugs that may be used to diagnosis, contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza pandemics in the U.S. The tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these pandemic medical countermeasures is the responsibility of the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP.   
 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. The Office of Research Development and Coordination of the Office of Public Health Emergency HHS/OPHEP/ORDC has an interest in identifying potential technologies, methods, assays and reagents that can be applied to the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of influenza virus infections and disease. The appropriate use of diagnostic assays and equipment during influenza seasonal or pandemic outbreaks may provide for more timely and accurate detection of influenza outbreaks and thus delay or contain influenza infections in local communities, may reduce the morbidity and mortality, and may mitigate the overwhelming load that will be placed on the healthcare system. Early detection of influenza by the use of appropriate tests will allow for an accurate triage of patients and the determination of the parameters of the pandemic in enough time to provide best use of disease spread countermeasures. Rapid, accurate high throughput laboratory bench systems and portable low cost point of care (POC) systems are both needed to identify the outbreak as quickly as possible and provide timely data and information for situational awareness to guide and monitor effective response measures. Responses to this RFI may address either or both of these areas of identified interest but should clearly indicate which area of need is being addressed in the response. 

Rapid diagnostics for influenza viruses currently lack sufficient specificity and sensitivity and timeliness of results to provide clinically relevant information. A need is present to have diagnostic platforms and assays for influenza and influenza like illnesses to provide timely diagnostic information to health care providers in the face of an emerging pandemic. Information is being sought on assays, methods and platforms that may meet near term and long-term program needs. 

High Through-put Bench Diagnostics tests should be:
1) Rapid: less than 4 hours from sample collection to results at point of care
 
2) Sensitive: the exact lower confidence bound for the 2-sided 95% CI should be greater than 95%, relative to culture at clinically significant levels of virus (10E1 to 10E6 TCID50/mL of a specified influenza A virus strain
 
3)Specific: better than 95% ability to differentiate the target organism in the presence of ten fold excess of near neighbors to distinguish specific strains of influenza virus

4)Cost effective: less than four dollars per organism characteristic identified, 12 dollars total per test cost (exclusive of test reader equipment cost if needed)

5)Flexible: able to be modified for newly emergent threats within weeks of their discovery

6)Cross-Reactivity: able to detect true positives and true negatives in the presence of typical commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, typically 108 TCID50 viruses, 108 bacteria or 106 yeasts per ml

7)Diagnostic would be used on currently available and widely used commercial diagnostic platforms where trained personnel are used in CLIA compliant settings. 

Point of Care Diagnostics tests should be:
1)Rapid: less than 30 minutes from sample collection to results at point of care
 
2)Sensitive: the exact lower confidence bound for the 2-sided 95% CI should be greater than 95%, relative to culture at clinically significant levels of virus (10E1 to 10E6 TCID50/mL of a specified influenza A virus strain

3)Specific: better than 95% ability to differentiate the target organism in the presence of ten fold excess of near neighbors to distinguish specific strains of influenza virus

4)Cost effective: less than four dollars per organism characteristic identified, 12 dollars total per test cost (exclusive of test reader equipment cost if needed)

5)Flexible: able to be modified for newly emergent threats within weeks of their discovery

6)Cross-Reactivity: able to detect true positives and true negatives in the presence of typical commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, typically 108 TCID50 viruses, 108 bacteria or 106 yeasts per ml.

7)Ideally testing can be done in multiple settings with minimum operator training; rapid tests should be adaptable to near patient testing (either CLIA waived or under supervision of a central laboratory

Combinations of sample preparations, screening tests and confirmation tests may be able to meet such over all requirements. The initial testing capability may require assays based on currently available commercial platforms but ideal future capabilities should accommodate all the indicated desired assay and system characteristics including purchase price, per assay costs, weight, foot print, sensitivity and specificity performances. 

An acceptable system would be easily portable  with a simple clinical sample loading design. The equipment should isolate the sample in a manner that minimizes bio-safety concerns and cross contamination concerns for subsequent or concurrent sample handling. An acceptable POC system would be capable of meeting system requirements of performance from sample collection to test result for 1 sample within 30 minutes by 1 technician. Sample types could include: Nasal and throat swabs, Nasal wash aspirates, Blood, or Urine. 

The instrument-based system or assay should be able to identify the 20 leading causes (bacterial, fungal and viral) of respiratory illness clinical presentation with Influenza Like Illness symptoms,  and differentiate novel influenza A viruses from seasonal influenza A viruses (i.e., H1N1 and H3N2) and other respiratory pathogens. Influenza or Influenza like Pathogens should be identified with a high level of certainty, using at least two characteristics per pathogen. Methods should be able to detect and differentiate specific influenza strains.  Genotypic or phenotypic characterization should include capability to discriminate phylogenetic relationships including gene swaps, or influenza serotypes.  Reagents should be optimized for maximum self-life with corresponding positive and negative controls. Desired reagent shelf life should be at least 6 months at room temperature.  Integrated sample prep and detection with minimal sample handling during the analysis would be optimal. Serial or batch sample analysis to maximize throughput would be ideal. If a reader or equipment is involved integrated Bi-Directional communication monitoring Software to report out results,  interpolate detection metrics, interpret the presence or absence of each pathogen , report results and receiving protocol updates should be discussed. Discussion of data optimization management systems is of interest for quality management and quality control measures during the life cycle of the device including developmental, testing and field use of the equipment or assay.

HHS will use information obtained by this RFI in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Please submit information in the following format:
1)     Name of Submitter
2)     Address of Submitter
3)     Name of Device, Assay or technology
4)     Technical / Method Summary
5)     Device specifications
6)     Performance Summary including any supportive data
7)     Clinical samples tested to date
8)     Viral straines tested to date
9)     Points of Contact
10)    Bibliography and/or References

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis (SSS) only.  There is no solicitation available.  This is a request for preliminary planning purposes only, and it does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, Solicitation, or a Request for Quotes.  It is not an indication the government will contract for the services contained in this SSS.  The government shall not reimburse respondents for any costs or expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this SSS.  

The HQ Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) seeks innovative and creative services to determine if there are potential commercial sources to provide missile chef services.  These efforts could potentially take place at three Air Force installations.  The services currently are being performed by military personnel at each location in Government facilities.  

The Contractor shall provide labor, management, supervision, materials/supplies, equipment, tools, food, on-site food preparation, condiments, and utensils for the development, management, and full operation of food services in the duties, responsibilities and operations of the AFSPC Missile Chef Feeding Program.  

The Missile Alert Facility (MAF) food service functions consist of operations at three ICBM Wings (Air Force Space Command).  The 90th Space Wing, F.E. Warren AFB, WY has 15 MAF feeding operation facilities serving 12,600 sq. miles and one centralized Missile Alert Facility Feeding Operation (MAFFO).  The 91st Space Wing, Minot AFB, ND has 15 MAF feeding operation facilities serving 8,500 sq. miles and one centralized MAFFO.  The 341st  Space Wing, Malmstrom AFB, MT has 20 MAF feeding operation facilities serving 23,500 sq. miles and one centralized MAFFO.  All MAFs are located in sparsely populated rural areas located 1-3 hours driving time from the main base.  These are Northern Tier facilities characterized by long, harsh winters and dangerous driving conditions.

The MAF is an above ground facility that permanently houses a two-person Missile Combat Crew (MCC), one Facility Manager (FM), one missile field chef, and six Security Forces (SF) personnel.  Typically, MAF support personnel are deployed to the MAFs for 3-day alert tours.  MAFs are operated to be self-sustaining during each alert tour and are periodically re-supplied with food, water, fuel and other supplies.  The MAF is a 24/7, 365 days a year operation.  

The primary customers are MCC, SF, FM, and Periodic Maintenance Teams (PMT).  Secondary customers are personnel that provide support to the MAF.  They are Communications (COMM), Civil Engineer (CE), Bio Environmental Health (BEE), Public Health (PH), and additional ICBM maintenance teams.  Throughout the year, Department of Defense (DOD) contractors perform duties at the MAF.  The Space Wing commander may authorize dependents and guests to eat out at the MAF.  These facilities are dedicated to providing full meal service and meeting the nutritional needs of all missile alert personnel who frequent the facility. 

In addition to 3M0X1 Services duties, the MAF chef is also responsible to the Missile Alert Facility Manager for Emergency Response.  These duties include the following: (a) Assist the FM during emergency LCC break-in.  Follows all instructions, guidance and application directed by the FM. (b) Assist the FM during emergency evacuation and bomb threat procedures in locating, assembling, and accounting for MAF personnel. (c) Assist the FM in the use of the LCEB emergency ladder and escape hatch when LCEB elevator is inoperable. (d) Maintain qualification and provide self-aid/buddy care and CPR for MAF personnel if necessary. (e) Assist the FM with Inspector General (IG) and Distinguished Visitor (DV) MAF security entry procedures. (f) Maintain knowledge on the operation of available communication devices used to communicate with MCC. (g) Assist the facility manager with escort requirements.  

Mission ops tempo for the MAF chef varies from day to day.  The amount of people on a MAF required to be fed can be anywhere from 10 to 30.  The chef must plan their schedule to meet mission needs.  Occasionally, this means working outside the normal hours of operation.  The following is an example of daily normal mission ops tempo for a MAF chef. (a) The MAF chef will prepare the Breakfast, Lunch, dinner and Midnight meals.  The Breakfast meal starts at 0630 to 0800.  Lunch meal starts at 1100 to 1300.  Dinner meal starts at 1600 to 1800.  The chef will need to deliver meals to the Launch Control Center 60-90 feet below ground for all meals.  The chef will collect money and signatures from the customers and accomplish accounting paperwork for all cooked meals.  The chef will clean the kitchen and dining area in accordance with the 2001 Food Code.  The chef will put away any subsistence or supplies they have received from MAFFO delivery.  A physical inventory on all storeroom subsistence is accomplished by the chef.  In addition, the chef must call in to MAFFO to order any subsistence or supplies they may need for the following day.  The chef will take down any meal orders for the Midnight meal.  The Midnight meal starts at 2130 to 2230.  If no meals are ordered, the chef duties are finished for that particular day.  

In FY05 approximately 1,302 meals were served daily and 475,491 were served annually throughout the three missile wings.  In addition, the chef provides ground support meals for members who are not able to consume their meal at the MAF.  The MAF Chef on duty ensures compliance with all federal and Air Force mandated sanitation requirements IAW Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Food Code 2001 and AFI 48-116, Food Safety Program.  

The chef is out at the MAF on a 24-hour basis for 3 days.  This is considered an alert tour.  A shift changeover is accomplished between the oncoming and off-going chef.  The oncoming chef will perform a facility self inspection using AF Form 977, Food Facility Evaluation along with the 2001 Critical Food Code Checklist  The off-going chef must correct all discrepancies prior to departing the MAF.  In addition, the oncoming chef will count the change fund and sign for the controlled accounting forms.  

Subsistence is delivered to each MAF feeding operation on a weekly basis by the missile alert personnel dispatching to that particular MAF.  Prior to dispatching to the field the subsistence is picked up from MAFFO.  Supplemental rations can be ordered daily.  The MAF chef on duty is responsible for the ordering, storage and inventory of all subsistence.  A subsistence inventory is accomplished daily.  All storeroom tasks are performed manually.  Additional subsistence is maintained at the MAF for contingency purposes.  MAFFO receives their food products from local and prime vendors on a daily basis.  

The MAF Chef on duty performs all accounting duties.  All monies and forms are provided by MAFFO and are picked up by the MAF Chef prior to dispatching to the field.  The missile feeding accounting works on a three day cycle.  Air Force accounting forms are used to record the sale of meals.  All accounting tasks are performed manually.  

The MAF Chef on duty is responsible for ordering and inventorying all supplies and dishware from MAFFO.  In addition, he/she must maintain food service equipment and report any equipment deficiencies to the facility manager.  All food service equipment must be NSF National Sanitation Foundation certified.  Base Civil Engineer and commercial contractors are used for the repair of food service equipment.

The MAF Chef is responsible for overall sanitation of the kitchen and dining area.  They clean and sanitize dishes, pots, pans, and all kitchen equipment in accordance with the FDA Food Code 2001.  A daily self inspection is accomplished.  Deep fat fryer grease is brought in from the field and properly disposed.

The MAF Chef and all support personnel are required to possess a Secret Clearance in order to access the MAF.  In addition, the chef is responsible to safeguard all government property.  At the end of each day, all government equipment, and materials shall be secured.  Funds are maintained by the chef IAW AFI 31-101, The Resource Protection Program.

MAFFO is centrally located on base.  The facility is responsible to provide storeroom, accounting, chef supplies and training support for all MAF feeding operations in the field.  There are typically two storerooms, two accountants, and one trainer assigned to the operation.

All chefs are trained on the following: Food Handlers Training, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, Fire Extinguisher Training, Self Aid Buddy Care, Fire Suppression System, LCEB Emergency Response Procedures, LCEB Blast Door Opening, Hazardous Spill Response ISST Fire and Over Heat Response, MAF Electrical and DEU Isolation, Emergency Evacuation Procedures, Natural Disaster Procedures, Emergency LCC Break-In, MAF Escort Requirements, Elevator Shaft Emergency Ladder, Duress Words and Reporting Procedures, Bomb Threat Procedures, Operation of Communication Devices, Operation of LCC Elevator

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, AZ is seeking to identify potential sources capable of providing Surrogate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) support and consulting services.  This is a market research tool to determine the availability of sources.  This announcement is for information purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Marine Corps, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  An award will not be made on offers received in response to this notice.  The NAICS code is 541690 and size standard is $6.5 million. Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1) has incorporated the use of the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)into the Weapons and Tactics Instruction (WTI) course curriculum.  Air space restrictions and the requirement to fly unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions over populated towns dictates the use of manned aerial vehicles that simulate the Predator UAV!   and provide Predator quality video from a sensor aboard the aircraft to an actual Predator ground control station.  This type of platform is known as a SUAV.  MCAS Yuma is seeking sources that have proven capability to meet all of the technical requirements listed in this document and a history of successful missions in support of military operations involving ground troops and air forces.  MAWTS-1 has specific requirements that must be met by the contractor to successfully complete all of the required missions.  WTI 1-07 REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall provide Surrogate UAV support and consulting services for course planning and execution of all required flights for the Weapons and Tactics Instruction course 1-07 in September and October of 2006.

<DESC>The Supervisors Office of the MT Hood National Forest is seeking sources for the below project description.  Please respond by August 15, 2006

SCOPE OF WORK

This contract requires prototyping, design, testing, and specific implementation of interactive TimeMaps. Interactive TimeMaps are stacked, thematic timelines that function online to serve as a comprehensive index to research findings and knowledge resources in a user-interactive, zoomable canvas that also contain embedded rich-media presentations on key topics by credible researcher scientists and other experts, as well as links to geographic display in modern online mapping applications.  

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION

A basic fully functional template for TimeMapping shall be developed that meets all the requirements specified here. During the prototyping, development and testing of the TimeMapping template, rich media resources will be set up to fit inside TimeMaps for specific areas. The areas include the Experimental Forests of the Pacific Research Stations (Pacific Northwest and Pacific Southwest), Research Natural Areas in FS Regions 5, 6, and 10, Mount St Helens, and the HJ Andrews Forest (part of the Willamette National Forest.  

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Prototyping, design, testing and specific implementation of TimeMapping will involve six tasks, as follows:

TASK 1 – Refine TimeMap prototyping and incorportate working functionality
A basic visual-only (low functionality) prototyping has been made to start the requirements process.  This may be found here: http://www.fsl.orst.edu/geowater/timemaps/protopres.html
The contractor will interact with the FS and its partners, proposing features and building online prototypes for review to refine the form and function of TimeMaps, add and revise features, and make various features functional and testable with real information and rich-media resources. A final, deployable TimeMap system shall be in place at the end of the contract period. All code shall be transparent, fully commented, and suitable for any knowledgeable ActionScript programmer to modify.

TASK 2 – Collect materials and create rich-media presentations
Contractor shall capture and produce 50 hours or more Persistent Electronic Presentations (PEPs) that create lectures and presentations on-demand. These include video compressed for online streaming, high quality sound, full screen-resolution slides, an interactive table of contents, scrub slider that is fully synchronized with the slides and video, and web links. The PEPs should be configured to conform to SCORM Standards and be fully embeddable in the TimeMap template, such that they can be zoomed up and will play normally, but may be interrupted by a zoom out command from the user. 

TASK 3 – Develop an effective technique to integrate PEPs, electronic documents, and imagry with TimeMaps
Contractor shall prototype, receive review, and modify PEPS, electronic documents, and imagry inside of TimeMaps to effectively embed these resources into the TimeMaps so that they are:
1)	simple for users to access,
2)	are not limited to the number of resources that can be so embedded (they should load independently of the TimeMap on-demand such that there is no effective limit to the amount of rich-media that may be embedded, other than space for visual interfacing inside the zoomable environment.
3)	All features of the PEPs are fully functional inside the TimeMaps
4)	Navigation of TimeMaps by user is not impaired by embedded resources

TASK 4 – Create a user-friendly marker submission system for TimeMap entries
Contractor shall prototype, design, test and implement an interactive online submission system for FS and partners to submit time marker events and corrections for inclusion into specific TimeMaps.  The system shall work via any webserver, without server-side support other than PHP, and shall be deployed for testing and review at the fsl.orst.edu website. 

TASK 5 – Develop and implement TimeMaps for specific areas
Contractor shall implement basic TimeMaps for the following areas: 
1)	Mount St Helens (Gifford Pinchot NF)
2)	HJ Andrews Forest
3)	At least 20 Experimental Forests
4)	At least 10 Research Natural Areas
5)	Copper River Delta (Chugach National Forest)
For each of these, a basic template and submission system shall be put online, and basic resources shall be embedded as they are available from contractors efforts and from materials submitted to contractor from the FS. 
In addition, to present the TimeMaps, a “profile page” that includes the TimeMaps shall be prepared for each of these places for use as a web portal. 

TASK 6 – Implement Evaluation Program  
To evaluate the overall effectiveness of the project at satisfying its objectives, an online questionnaire shall be developed and posted on each TimeMap page for participants to provide comment and feedback.  Access statistics shall be kept to track usage, and attempt to solicit feedback regarding the ease and efficiency of the TimeMap template, web page, and submission system. 

Basic Requirements for TimeMap functionality

A visual demonstration of TimeMap features may be accessed here: 
http://www.fsl.orst.edu/geowater/timemaps/protopres.html

Definitions/Terms
TimeRibbon (timeslice): A single timeline or category of key events in a research property such as an experimental forest or other research-rich area.

TimeMap: A collection of vertically stacked ribbons. 

Requirements
•	Designed as a Flash Application for modularity
•	Database / XML backend for ease of update and quick redraw of ribbon content or organization
•	Full text search-ability
•	Ribbons can be moved and rearranged by dragging
•	One to many ribbons can be opened at a time to compare information

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source modification to an existing purchase order that was awarded to VeriCold Technologies GMBH for custom wiring services as detailed below.

BACKGROUND

NIST purchased a dilution refrigerator, specified to be able to cool a sample to a base temperature of 20 milliKelvin and having a cooling power of 200 microWatts at a temperature of 100 milliKelvin, from VeriCold Technologies.

At the time of the purchase of the refrigerator, NIST’s exact requirements for coupling electrical and optical signals into (and out of) the refrigerator were not known.  In the meantime, NIST has settled on a need for at least two radiofrequency signal lines, for signals up to 500 MHz.  In addition, NIST plans to use six optically encoded nanopositioners made by Attocube Systems.  These nanopositioners are each controlled via two electrical wires and monitored with one optical fiber.  

REQUIRED SERVICES

NIST now requires a Contractor to install two coaxial cables inside the dilution refrigerator which is currently being manufactured for NIST by VeriCold Technologies.  The coaxial cable must be installed as follows: On the top of the dilution refrigerator are four DN 25 KF vacuum flanges and one DN 40 KF flange.  The Contractor shall use one of the DN 25 KF flanges to rout the coaxial cables into the dilution refrigerator.  The Contractor shall provide a flange containing two 50 Ohm SMA vacuum feedthroughs, either employing one of the DN 25 KF flanges directly or using an adaptor as necessary.  Any adaptor must not obstruct any of the other KF flanges also present on the dilution refrigerator.  A length of semirigid coaxial cable shall run from each SMA vacuum feedthrough to the second stage heat exchanger (at approximately 4 Kelvin), where both inner and outer conductors are to be thermally anchored.   The coaxial cable shall also be thermally anchored at the first stage heat exchanger.  From the second stage heat exchanger down to the mixing chamber, superconducting coaxial cable must be used.  The cables at the mixing chamber shall be terminated in SMA connectors.  

In addition, the Contractor shall use one of the remaining DN 25 KF flanges to install appropriate wiring and optical fibers to allow control and readout of six Attocube nanopositioning stages, four of type ANPx100/LIN and two ANPz100/LIN.  Again, the wires shall be thermally anchored at the first and second stage heat exchangers, and superconducting wire is to be used from the second stage heat exchanger to the mixing chamber.  The optical fibers shall be heat sunk as necessary to maintain system performance.  At the mixing chamber, appropriated connectors shall be provided to interface both optical fibers and electrical wires directly to the Attocube positioners.  At the room temperature end, all electrical wires shall be connected to a single multi-pin vacuum feedthrough.  The fibers shall be provided with FC/APC connectors at the room temperature end, and it is not necessary that they exit the vacuum chamber (NIST will handle that).  A DN 25 KF vacuum tee shall be provided such that both wires and fibers can exit the same DN 25 KF flange on top of the dilution refrigerator, and subsequently the wires shall be routed horizontally and the fibers will exit vertically.

NOTICE OF NIST'S INTENT

Based on the fact that NIST is procuring the refrigerator from VeriCold Technologies, NIST intends to modify Purchase Order No. SB1341-05-N-1621 that was awarded to VeriCold Technologies to procure the services required as detailed above so that NIST will have a complete refrigerator solution.  The modification will be done under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b).  Other responsible sources that believe they should be provided an opportunity to complete for the wiring services detailed above shall identify themselves to joseph.widdup@nist.gov on or before the response date for this posting and clearly and unequivocally demonstrate their capability to satisfy the wiring requirements noted above and provide a rationale for how the services required as detailed above could be competed, notwithstanding the fact that the refrigerator hasn't been delivered to NIST yet.  The Government will determine, based on written responses received in response to this posted notice, whether this procurement will be competed.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of intent to award sole source
<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to FR Holdings Inc. doing business as (DBA) Chelton Avionics Inc. Wulfsberg Electronics Division located at 10 Cobham Dr, Orchard Park, NY 14127-4121.  The award will be made for the purchase of a Wulfsburg RT 5000 Transceiver quantity (1) one, a Wulfsburg C-5000 NGV Display quantity (1) one, a Wulfsburg AT-560 antenna quantity (1) one, and a Wulfsburg RT-5000 upgrade kit, quantity (1) one. This procurement is being conducted under Federal Acquisi tion Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, for Other than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USPFO for Tennessee Contracting Division Attn: Randal Halbrooks, PO Box 41502 Nashville, or sent by email to randal.halbrooks@ng.army.mil . Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted. Responses to this notice shall be received no later than 3:30 PM Central Standard Time (CST), Monday, August 14, 2006. A determination  not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  The point of contact for this announcement is Randal Halbrooks, Contract Specialist, at randal.halbrooks@ng.army.mil. The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase.  1.	This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for a Wulfsberg RT-5000 Transceiver, a Wulfsberg C-5000 NVG Display, a Wulfsberg AT-560 antenna  and an upgrade kit for the RT-5000 Transceiver requested by the Counter Drug Divi sion of the Tennessee Army National Guard. 2.	This radio equipment shall be mounted into a Light Armored Vehicle (LAV). The Wulfsberg equipment will allow the Counter Drug Division to operate two radios through one control head giving them access to VHF, UHF and 800MHz Trunking bands; this access t o all these frequencies will allow the Counter Drug Division to communicate with military entities, law enforcement and other civilian agencies simultaneously. 3.	The total estimated value of this radio system is $58,914.00. 4.	Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  5.	The LAV is already equipped with a Wulfsberg model number C-5000 control head; Wulfsberg is the only company who manufactures equipment compatible with this control head.   6.	A Request For Information (RFI) was issued via General Services Administration (GSA) eBUY asking all of the vendors under schedule 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132 8 who offered radio equipment if they could provide a brand name or equal item. Of the se venty-nine (79) vendors who were solicited only one vendor responded and the quote was for brand name items. Efforts to solicit other contractors will be made via http://www.fedbizopps.gov in accordance with FAR 5.2.  A Notice of Intent to Award Sole Sourc e will be issued on Tuesday August 8, 2006. 7.	The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices proposed in other purchases of this nature and by prices offered by the vendor who responded to the GSA eBUY RFI.  8.	Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by publishing a RFI to all GSA vendors listed as manufacturers or distributors of radios. 9.	Wulfsberg is the only known vendor who can provide a product capable of connecting and working with an existing Wulfsberg component.  10.	The only source who has expressed an interest in this acquisition other than Wulfsberg is JS Bond INC.; JS Bond INC. indicated they would be willing to provide brand name Wulfsberg product s. 11.	No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as the Wulfsberg Electronics Division is the only manufacturer capable of providing the components necessary to upgrade an existing Wulfsberg system. 12.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATON:

The National Weather Service has purchased and deployed radio transmitters to fulfill its mission providing an All Hazards Weather Radio Warning and Alert System.  This system is used in conjunction with Homeland Security for National Security in the event of a terrorist attack, amber alerts, or severe weather warnings which protect the lives and property of the citizens of the United States of America.  The National Weather Radio Program consists of 953 radio transmitters, covering all 50 states, adjacent coastal waters, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Territories.

The only known sources with pre-qualified frequencies to match NOAA NWS’s transmitters for incorporation into the NOAA NWS radio network are Crown and Armstrong.  This was performed under competitive acquisition procedures.  

This procurement is for three new transmitters to have on hand as spares (one for immediate replacement) to be used in the geographical areas of the network that are dominated by Crown transmitter models WRG1000.  

The maintenance personnel and contractor personnel have received extensive training and on the job elements to maintain the fleet of Crown transmitters in their designated areas.  The NOAA, NWS provides support to maintain stocked levels of spare replacement parts to maintain a mandated operational readiness of 24 hour restoration time.  Procuring transmitters from other manufactures would cause undue risk of off air/down time due to the lack of spares/replacement parts for the pre-qualified transmitters.  Sites equipped with Crown transmitters are not interchangeable with Armstrong equipment and vice-versa.  Therefore, a sole source is necessary to obtain the three transmitters from Crown.  To eliminate the potential for sole source on future requirement, there is a solicitation in development for full and open competition to solicit sources/offers for upgrading current transmitters at all locations.  Expected release of the solicitation is on or about mid-2007.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATON:  Armstrong Transmitters
The National Weather Service has purchased and deployed radio transmitters to fulfill its mission providing an All Hazards Weather Radio Warning and Alert System.  This system is used in conjunction with Homeland Security for National Security in the event of a terrorist attack, amber alerts, or severe weather warnings which protect the lives and property of the citizens of the United States of America.  The National Weather Radio Program consists of 953 radio transmitters, covering all 50 states, adjacent coastal waters, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Territories.
The only known sources with pre-qualified frequencies to match NOAA NWS’s transmitters for incorporation into the NOAA NWS radio network are Crown and Armstrong.  This was performed under competitive acquisition procedures.  
This procurement is for three new transmitters to have on hand as spares (one for immediate replacement) to be used in the geographical areas of the network that are dominated by Armstrong Transmitter Model G1000.  
The maintenance personnel and contractor personnel have received extensive training and on the job elements to maintain the fleet of Armstrong transmitters in their designated areas.  The NOAA, NWS provides support to maintain stocked levels of spare replacement parts to maintain a mandated operational readiness of 24 hour restoration time.  Procuring transmitters from other manufactures would cause undue risk of off air/down time due to the lack of spares/replacement parts for the pre-qualified transmitters.  Sites equipped with Crown transmitters are not interchangeable with Armstrong equipment and vice-versa.  Therefore, a sole source is necessary to obtain the three transmitters from Armstrong.  To eliminate the potential for sole source on future requirement, there is a solicitation in development for full and open competition to solicit sources/offers for upgrading current transmitters at all locations.  Expected release of the solicitation is on or about mid-2007.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

***AMENDMENT IS TO ADD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS TO THIS SOLICITATION***

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

                    HSCGG8-06-Q-PKB154B
1) Does the coast guard have any existing B-ROLL that could be used? 
 
There is no existing B-Roll available.

2) Is there a budget range? 

No!  It is a fixed price contract
 
3) How realistic? At least (2) scenarios call for a boat
capsizing. Does the CG want an actual boat capsized?
Use of animation to show a capsizes? Simulate events
to demonstrate a capsize (without actually showing
the boat turning over. The question then is does the
CG want this video to be as true as possible to the
real thing? Or, does the CG want close simulations?

The scenarios must be as realistic as possible. Actual boat capsizing and fires will be added digitally. 

4) Has the Coast Guard specified a period of performance for the work or a date by which the DVDs must be delivered?
Yes, One year from date of the award of contract.

5)  As travel and per diem costs will differ widely depending on where the video shooting takes place, and Offerors may make quite different assumptions on shooting locations, would the Coast Guard consider specifying two locations for shooting, so that the Offerors are on equal footing in their cost estimates?
Yes, I would like to keep it to two shooting locations. The shooting locations will be on the east coast at Portsmouth, VA or Cape Canaveral, Fl. depending on weather and availability of boat crews. 

6)  Since the proposal is for commercial services and will be awarded on a fixed price basis, is there any reason that detailed cost estimates are required?
No!

7)  If a small business prime does not have a DCAA-approved cost accounting system, can it submit its pricing proposal using its established, commercial rate card for labor hours, and its standard "handling charge" on ODCs, travel, etc., instead of G&A rates?
Yes! It’s a fix price! How you determine your bid is up to you!


My company has interest in this solicitation.  Can you tell me if this is a new requirement?  If it’s follow-on work, is there an incumbent?

This is a new requirement! There is no follow-on or incumbent!

8)  Is it permissible to shoot on a different comparable digital video format, such as D-9 or DVCAM or HDV?  If so will the contractor be required to provide cloned masters (digital copies) to the government on Digital Betacam?
Yes! You must provide clean copies on Digital Betacam. 

9)  "Contractor will assume all costs of travel for their employees and equipment."  Does this mean, a.  the contractor cannot budget for these items in its cost proposal; or, b. that they must be included in the budget, rather than billed to the government after the fact?
All travel costs must be included in your fixed bid. It is an all inclusive bid. 

10)  Is there an incumbent or preferred contractor?
 There is no incumbent contractor.

11)  Previous question and CG's answer - "If working on a CG vessel at sea or in port, will the CG provide meals for the crew on-board or will the producer have to make arrangements for catering? CG will provide meals for their personnel."  New Question for Clarification: "Crew" could be interpreted either "CG Crew" or “film crew." By "their personnel," does that mean CG personnel or film crew?
The Coast Guard will provide all meals for only its personnel. 

11)  In Q&A on the first version of the solicitation, it states, "There will be (3) DVDs with 7 scenarios on each."  On this solicitation, it is stated "(1) Original DVDs with a menu taking the user to three sections of 7 scenarios."  We assume this latter requirement replaces the first, and that the government wants 300 copies of this original DVD.  Correct?
Correct! There is (1) DVD with a menu that takes you to three sections of (7) scenarios. 

12) "Contractor must have experience developing scripts from mishap data."  This would narrow the field of competition considerably.  Is the government willing to waive these requirements?  Or will the contractor be allowed to hire a subcontractor for scripting with this qualification?  Does the government have a list of recommended mishap script writers?

No, Contractor must have experience developing scripts. 

13) "Contractor must have a thorough understanding of Coast Guard safety policies and procedures." Will the government be willing to accept a proposal from a contractor who would become familiar with these policies and procedures as part of the project, or who would hire a consultant who is familiar with them?

Yes, the contractor could become familiar with Coast Guard policies and procedures or hire someone who is!

14) While we have experience filming underwater, and the government requires this experience for this project, the previous Q&A indicated is will not be necessary to actually film underwater for this project.  This is a significant budget consideration, therefore, are we correct in assuming this new solicitation will not require actual underwater production? 

There will be no underwater filming!

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STRUCTURAL STRENGTH TEST BRANCH DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM ASSEMBLY.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions asked before the due date. 1 Question: The front flush doors do NOT cover the entire front opening. Per the manufacturer data, there is about a 4" gap at the top. We just wanted to verify that this is what you are looking for or if we should ask them to make one of the front doors bigger. Answer:  Refer to diagram: NASA RDH With Doors, in the front view the 4" gap is shown about a third of the way from the bottom to accomodate the keyboard and monitor drawer. 2. Question:  Emcor has 9 standard textured paint finishes available. Please specify paint color unless you need a "custom" paint color. Answer: If there is no default factory color, then Neutral is acceptable.  All units should be of the same color. 3. Question: For the 1U panels, do you need it to be painted and if yes what color should we use. As to the labeling do you want it with silk screening or engraving? Answer: The purpose of the overlays is to provide permanent, readily visible, channel identification.  If they are painted, it should be to contrast the channel number with the background.  Regarding silk screening vs. engraving, as long as the result is a permanent channel identification, we have no preference. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on July 31, 2006.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>This amendment is being issued to provide clarification on place of performance.  The place of performance shall be at the contractor’s place of business and the contractor will only need to visit Rockville, Maryland to deliver the product if necessary.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-60115-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-11.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Technology Transfers Branch (TTB) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to enhance the current Technology Information Management System (TIMS) database with enhanced features and re-program TIMS to maximize features of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541511, and the business size standard is $21M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Background:  
	General Description: The Technology Transfer Branch (TTB) of the Federal Government’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) converted eight (8) individual and separate flat files of varying record size from FileMaker Pro (FMPro) version 4.1 into a FMPro 6.0 relational database referred to as the Technology Information Management System (TIMS).  Contracts have been awarded to design the new relational database, to design a user interface, and build the database.  The TTB now requires FMPro expertise to upgrade and enhance the database.
	
	Evolution of Requirements: A self-designed “unrelated” FMPro system had been used by TTB for the management and tracking of mission-related work since the early 1990s.  In the late 1990's TTB determined that the number of records and the needs of the office had outgrown the capabilities of the “unrelated” database system.  A relationally designed database  to most efficiently maintain the integrity of and standardize the entry of data, to track mission-related efforts and to produce accurate and cogent reports was developed and has been in use since November 2002.  TTB continues to enhance TIMS to meet the changing needs of NCI and TTB.  Those needs include new technology transfer requirements, specialized reporting to the Office of the Director, NCI, and changes in TTB procedures.		
	
Purpose and Objective:

The TTB is responsible for negotiating agreements between NCI scientist and private sector companies for the collaborative development of federally funded bio-medical research into commercially successful products.  The Main focus of these collaborative efforts is to produce commercial products that will improve the public health.  In addition, the TTB is also a Competitive Service Center (CSC) for technology transfer.  Under the CSC, the TTB negotiates agreements for 10 other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health.  One of the responsibilities of these collaborative agreements is to track the agreement negotiations from initial request to execution of the agreement, and through agreement expiration to final destruction of the physical file itself.  This process can span several years and involve many tracking dates.  TTB currently negotiates eight different types of agreements for the NIH. 
	
	The specific objectives of this procurement are to: 1) enhance the current TIMS database with enhanced features such as reporting, advertising, action items, etc. and 2) re-program  TIMS to maximize the features of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.

Statement of Work:

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Shall be at the contractor's place of business and the contactor will only need to visit Rockville to deliver the product if necessary.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
	
	Specific Tasks to be Performed:  The contractor shall provide technical skills, insights and expertise on FMPro database development and implementation.  The contractor shall be a certified FileMaker Pro 8 developer.  Due to the complexity of the information that is tracked in the TIMS database, the many inter-relationships of the various agreements, and the need to obtain and integrate into TIMS data from other databases which are written in different programming languages, the contractor shall have at least 10 years FMPro experience in order to perform the work.   TTB shall provide all TTB mission-related information necessary to develop the database upon execution of contract.
	

	1.  	Add additional features to the database from the list of projects below.   The order in which additional features are selected to work on will be determined by a variety of factors such as needs of TTB, logical progression depending on re-programming (see 2 below), etc.  
	
	2.	Re-program the current TIMS database in FileMaker Pro 8.0 to maximize the features of version 8 and enhance the current database structure, file structure and user interface and produce a Beta version: The contractor shall build all of the files with field definitions, create relationships between the files, show related data, and put business rules and constraints in place on field values.  The contractor shall test the system for: 1) the database and file structure design, 2) the user interface for functionality.  Once the system is upgraded, tested, and bug free, the Contractor shall provide a beta version to TTB for testing.  The contractor shall install the Beta version on TTB's server and on 5 TTB staff members' computers.  TTB Staff shall use the beta version for 10 business days and provide comments to the Project Officer.  The Project Officer shall inform the Contractor of all comments.  Corrections and changes shall be made by the Contractor within 30 days from of receipt of comments and corrections.   The Contractor shall provide the final version of the system in a client/server format for about 51 TTB staff members.
	

	3.  	The final product shall be Section 508 compliant.
							
	PROJECTS LIST:
	

	
	1.	Reports:
		a)	Add ability to design or customize individual reports.
b)	Add/enhance ability to easily export report information into Word or Excel

	2.  	Search Function:
		a)	Enhance the search capabilities so they are more flexible and robust
		b)	Add the ability to remove or omit specific records from a found set 
	
	3.  	General
a)	Create the ability, like in old FMPro to move from record to record in a found set 	without going back and forth to a list of records. 
b)	The scroll feature needs work so that when you have scrolled down a list of 	records, selected and examined one record, and come back to the main screen,	 	you will go to the record you selected and not up to the top of the list as it 	currently is set.  [it is called Sticky Portal]
	c)	Ability to add text to modules/records
	d)	Link the status to the date field
	e)	Add Spell Check option so that it offers ability to add names, etc. so they don’t 			come up again and again. [This may be a standard feature in FMP 8+]
	f)	Make fields with pull down menus not modifiable
 
	4.  	CRADA Module
	a)	Program the amendments window to allow for page breaks and multi-page 			documents.
	b)	Make it easier to generate a CRADA amendment
	c)	The Amendment Form Header pulls from the same updated fields as the 				Clearance form, yet the information required for each is different.  Program so it 			pulls in the current information in its fields, not the new information being added 			via the amendment.  The latter should be captured in the body of the amendment. 
d)	When the months for a CRADA amendment extension are entered in the record, 	have the expiration date be automatically recalculated by the system.
e)	Appendix C Language Changes table searchable for each paragraph and ability to 	review the language.

	5.  	CTA Module

a)	Add Negotiator field and a specialist field in the CTA module as exists in all other 	agreement modules.

	6.  	AdOps Module 
		a)	Redesigned
	
	7.  	Extramural Invention Waivers 
		a)	Redesigned
	
	8.  	Letters and Memos
	a)	Have the ability to save modified letters for specific agreements within the 				agreement record in TIMS. [As a PDF file would be best.  This would be 				helpful in moving to a “document management system”.  Should also consider 			adding patent document to the EIR record, these document could include: OTT 			recommendation, original EIR, patent application, etc.]
b)	Have ability to print address labels from the contacts/org modules and to have the 	address merge into a letter.


9.	EIR Module

a)	Add Automatic Action item to generate a report if the future “Cost Sharing” 	button is added.
b)	Add ability to pull the issued patent from USPTO website.  This is relatively easy 	since there is a 	specific web-link for each Patent.  I am sure this could be applied 	to the published patent 	applications, including foreign patents and patent 	applications.  We just need the web-link 	information.
c)	Add ability to add post TRG items, similar to TRG Requests. This would help 	tracking the transactional development items in an EIR.

	10. 	Action Items

	a)	Move the Action Items toward an Agreement History, that is, remove the 				comments field and make every “comment” and Action Item a “History Item” 
b)	Certain action items should be a mandatory part of what we do (one year post 	provisional, 18 months post PCT filing, 3 months prior to CRADA expiration, 2 	months prior to CRADA LOI expiration).  TTB to decide what things need to be 	mandatory action items, then Colleen will need to program.
	
	11. 	Ability to set non-PHS/NIH contacts on Signatory List.  Currently the user can only designate PHS/NIH Contacts as “signatory”.  We need this function to identify a non-PHS/NIH Contact as signatory so their name appears on an agreement signature block.
	
	12.  	Create and store .pdf of agreement related documents 
	If standard NIH document with no modifications 
	then .pdf of signature page is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If standard NIH document with modifications 
	then .pdf of entire document is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If non-standard NIH document 
	then .pdf of entire document is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If printing an agreement, have the option to add a PDF file into TIMS (or specific location) See idea below (next bullet) for printing letter/memos/forms.
	(All scanned document are sent to a "default" location and stored so TIMS knows where to find them)
	
	13.  	Have a feature added which asks User "is this final?" when printing letter/memo/internal document. This would eliminate the multiple Automatic Action Items when documents (Letters/Memos/Forms are printed multiple times before the User is satisfied.
•	If yes, then --> 
	(a) TIMS generates an automatic .pdf, stores it in the record (allowing for retrieval/usage at later time) 
	(b) Generates automatic action item 
•	If no, then --> 
	(a) no .pdf file is generated or stored 
	(b) no automatic action is generated 
	14.  	Incorporate QC into the TIMS fields:
•	“Specialist” is filled in.
•	Status and Date fields match
&#61607;	If status is ‘active’ then execution date is completed
&#61607;	If status is ‘expired’ then expiration date has past
&#61607;	If status is ‘terminated’ then termination date is complete
&#61607;	If status is ‘withdrawn’ then withdrawn date is complete
•	For CRADAs make sure ‘Type’ is not empty
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then Abstract field is complete
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then term is not empty
•	CTAs if status is active, then ‘materials field is not empty
•	For EIRs NIH Reference number matches the appropriate type and status
•	For EIRs if the status is filed, then the filing date is not empty
•	For EIRs, if the type is EIR then the date received is complete
	15.  	Add a “sub-status” field to cover an EIR moving to Research Tool 
	16.  	Add a “Project” drawer, to track non-agreement projects.  The “Project” drawer would allow the User to ‘link’ to other agreements such that a Project could lead to an agreement. 
	17.  	Add ERROR message to MTA record if Material information (Developed under grant, Research of Human Subjects, 45 CFR Part 46 & Assurance number) are not filled out. Make this section stand out in the record (change text to red?)
	18.  	Re-design or re-word or if possible, get rid of error message created when TIMS is incorrectly exited by User.
	19.  	Add a field to MTAs for "Protocol Number".  In light of the new human subject assurance documentation, it would be helpful to have this field.
	

	DATABASE SPECIFICATIONS:.
	
	User Interface will be designed for 17 inch monitors with industry standard Web dimensions 1024 X 768 Pixels
