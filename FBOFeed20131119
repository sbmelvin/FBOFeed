<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number:  E14PS00003 for Proposed Research on Renewable Energy of Oil and Gas Operations in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf
DESCRIPTION:
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to both Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and BSEE Technology Assessment Program (TAP) on Renewable Energy in the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of research previously completed and recently performed, visit http://bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Operational-Safety-and-Engineering.aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:   
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) TAP is requesting White Papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. The parties that submitted selected White Papers will be requested to submit proposals.  NOTE:  The BOEM and BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify BOEM and BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/Proposals shared outside of BOEM and BSEE.  BOEM and BSEE anticipate awards resulting from this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.  The BSEE anticipates that a total budget of $350,000.00 may be available for the initiation of new research and/or studies addressing topics identified through this announcement.   
OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2014 renewable research funding should be limited to the following: 
1.  Model testing to evaluate degradation of axial pile capacity from cyclic loading Jacket and tripod structures for Offshore Wind Turbine Structure (OWTS) in deeper waters are relatively lightly loaded compared to oil and gas platforms and cyclic loads can be a design concern.  Degradation of axial pile capacity from cyclic loading needs to be better understood.  Model or full scale axial cyclic load tests are needed to confirm recent analytical methods.
2. Cable Spacing Although previous Technical Assessment Program (TAP) study 671 looked at cable burial procedures and depths, cable spacing has not been considered.  Additional effort to determine optimal or minimum distances for placement of individual cables should be pursued.  Effort should focus on in-field distribution lines as well as high voltage transmission lines typical to Offshore Wind Farms in use today.  This effort will assist in the determination of transmission line ROW requirements for project development and lease sale development.
3. Offshore Substation Design Development of standards, regarding substations or other ancillary facilities, has not been investigated by BOEM. Additionally, substation design practice is relatively new in industry.  These structures are critical to the operation of the wind farm, massive and propose unique design questions relative to extreme deck loads and unique safety and environmental issues. As the loss of a substation would render large portions or all of a wind farm inoperable, the substation should have higher nominal target reliability than individual turbines.  Efficient design concepts which achieve the highest nominal target reliability should be examined with an eye to minimizing fabrication and installation costs.
4. Development of "Regional" Metocean Conditions for individual WEAs on the US OCS Development of "regional" metocean data (wind, wave, current and tide) for each BOEM Wind Energy Area (WEA) on the OCS (Atlantic Seaboard, Pacific Coast and Hawaii) would be a valuable tool for developers during front end engineering and design (FEED).  Additionally it would give regulatory agencies a measuring stick against which to assess the accuracy of various site-specific metocean data under review.  This proposal builds upon existing TAP study 672.  
5.  Development of Hazard Curves for WEAs off the Atlantic seaboard We lack clear understanding of the extreme weather hazards encountered by structures on various areas of the OCS.  Developing site specific hazard curves, based on regional metocean data would allow us to analyze the various hazard curves for the WEAs. Appropriate analysis would then be possible to compare implicit safety in reference level designs.  Calibration of safety factors (partial load or reserve strength) would then be possible to achieve consistent structural survivability (target safety level) in all WEAs on the OCS (Atlantic Seaboard, Pacific Coast and Hawaii).
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Acquisition Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN:  Ms. Herma J. Banks, not later than 2:00 PM, Eastern Time on Friday, December 20, 2013.  WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort.  NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER.  The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits.  IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL WILL BE REQUESTED FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.  BOEM and BSEE shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the complete proposal.  This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. 
WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the Offerors understanding of the technical issues; (3) the Offerors ability to implement the proposed approach; (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by the oil and gas industry or other groups in the research industry, where appropriate; and (5) past performance. 
IF ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NOT MET, THE WHITE PAPER WILL NOT BE EVALUATED.  Questions shall be E-mailed to herma.banks@bsee.gov not later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time on Monday, November 25, 2013. The Solicitation number E14PS00003 MUST be referenced in the subject line of the email.  All questions shall include the Solicitation number E14PS00003, your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers.  Telephone inquiries WILL NOT be accepted.  A separate White Paper shall be submitted for each topic on which the offeror wishes to propose.  The White Paper shall identify clearly the Offerors company/organization, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers.  If offerors desire to hand deliver their White Paper, they are advised that the BSEE facility is a secure office complex and offerors MUST NOT enter the building beyond the lobby. There is a courtesy telephone at the guard station to which you must call extension 7-1432 for Ms. Banks to meet and receive your submittal.  You MUST contact Ms. Herma J. Banks at 703-787-1432 and set up an appointment 24 hours in advance of dropping off your White Paper.

<p>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 12/3/2013</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION, CAGE 84561</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Restricted Rights Data Restrictions apply.</p>
<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: UNRESTRICTED</p>
<p>PREP FOR DELIVERY</p>
<p>PKGING DATA - QUP 001:<br />SHALL BE PACKAGED STANDARD COMMERCIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASTM D 3951</p>
<p>For all shipments of packaged materiel to the government,<br />which includes either Depot (DLA-Direct) or DVD (Customer-<br />Direct) shipments, both DoD linear and two-dimensional (2D)bar code markings are required on Military Shipping Labels in accordance with MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December 15, 2002 (but see DLAD 52.211-9010(D) for exceptions to the requirement for MSL and 2D symbols). See the DLA packaging web site identified in DLAD 52.211-9010(E) for change notices to MIL-STD-129P that apply. 2D bar coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC 15434 (ANSI MH10.8.3) and DoD 4500.9-R. MSL linear (code 3 of 9 or code 39) bar coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 16388. Shipping label stock quality shall meet MIL-PRF-61002. Bar code print quality shall meet ANSI MH10.8-2000 or ANSI X3.182-1990 (R2000) for applicable 2D and/or linear bar codes. All DVD shipments shall meet additional linear bar coding requirements in DLAD 52.211-9010(C). Except for the Transportation Control Number (TCN), which must always be present on the Military Shipping Label, when the contract/order omits any other data elements as defined in MIL-STD-129P and if the information is not available from the Administrative Contracting Office, then the fIeld is not required as part of the Military Shipping Label and may be left blank. If there are inconsistencies between the schedule and MIL-STD-129P, the schedule takes precedence.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publically disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publically for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be publically disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

This extension will ensure program continuity and critical mission support while allowing the necessary time to complete ongoing efforts associated with a competitive follow-on procurement.  The current Contractor provides mission critical safety, health, and environmental support services for the NASA/DFRC Edwards, CA and Palmdale, CA locations.  Services are currently obtained using a hybrid firm-fixed price (FFP) and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The Contractor provides all resources, including labor, supervision, materials and management necessary to operate safety, health and environmental support service functions as described in the Statement of Work.  The extension will increase the current contract value and extend the period of performance for two (2) months plus four (4) one-month options, for a total potential extended performance period of up to six (6) months, from December 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014. &lt;p&gt; The current contractor, MECx, is considered the only contractor that can meet NASA/DFRCs requirements given the potentially short period of performance for the extension.  Award to another source while the competitive process for a follow-on contract is occurring would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Award to another source while the competitive process for the follow-on contract is ongoing would also not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA/DFRCs requirements. &lt;p&gt; The Government does intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  &lt;p&gt; Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort to the identified point of contact IN WRITING no later than 4:30 PM PST on November 26, 2013.  Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  &lt;p&gt; Oral communications are not accepted in response to this notice.  &lt;p&gt; All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Far Supplement Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	. &lt;p&gt;

<DESC>Brand Name Justification AppSense Maintenance and Support FSA uses the AppSense Management Suite for the Enterprise Citrix Shared Desktop Solution (ECSDS). AppSense is used to assist with management of user profiles. AppSense Manager provides precise user control with a user-based policy and personalization engine that delivers user and application settings on-demand to any desktop, on any device on the context of the user, location, and time. An order will be placed with Convergence Technology Consulting, a small business reseller for AppSense, to purchase follow-on support at a Silver level. The period of support will be November 24, 2013 to November 23, 2015. It is not practical or cost effective to replace a product for the sole purpose of competing support for a product. Replacing a product can introduce unwarranted risks and can cost the Government up to $550,000 due to testing, integration, and implementation of the new software. It is determined that AppSense support is essential to the Government&rsquo;s requirements and it is in the best interest of the Government to purchase.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Cockpit Prototyping Phase 4 research and development (R&D).  The objective of the Phase 4 work is to provide human machine interface R&D for defining CEV cockpit layout requirements, displays, and controls rapid prototyping using iterative interaction.  The Government intends to award a follow-on contract to the CEV Cockpit Prototyping Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 Contracts.  This acquisition will be a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract.  The period of performance is planned for May 1, 2014, through April 30, 2019.  &lt;p&gt; NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Aerospace Applications North America (AANA), Houston, TX.  AANA is the CEV Cockpit Prototyping Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 contractor and has contracted with NASA on the three aforementioned R&D projects. The CEV Cockpit Prototyping Phase 4 R&D tasks are an extension of work completed during Phases 1, 2, and 3.

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support plans to establish a five year Long Term Contract (LTC) N00383-14-R-0002 for the repair of 1 item in support of P-3. The estimated amount for the life of the contract is $2,107,800.00. A list of the items has been uploaded with this synopsis as an Attachment A. The line items listed on Attachment A, can be repaired by various sources and the place of performance has yet to be determined. There are multiple sources that possess full repair capability of this item. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
  For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Scott Paris at (215) 697-2582.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>1.  Synopsis.  <br>  <br> This Request for Information/Sources Sought Announcement (RFI/SSA) is being issued to accomplish market research for Software Support, Spares Repairs and Program Management for the Initial Production (IP) AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI/SSA, or to otherwise pay for the information requested.  This RFI/SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal.  It shall not be used as the basis for a proposal.  This RFI/SSA is being issued to obtain information from interested sources regarding their ability to satisfy the requirements of Software Support, Spares Repairs and Program Management for the Initial Production AN/TPQ-53 Radar System and their ability to meet the Government's technical performance, cost and schedule requirements.   <br>  <br> 2.  Introduction. <br>  <br> a.  Program Description.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Radar Systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System shall satisfy known, current, and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems. The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System is a highly mobile radar that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM).  It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions.  The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.    <br>  <br> Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection.  Brigade combat teams and fires brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counterfire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations.  <br>   <br> b.  Program Background and Procurement History.  In 2006, the Government awarded a development contract (W15P7T-06-C-T004) to Lockheed Martin following full and open competition.  This contract provided for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System and the purchase of four non recurring engineering radars.  Twelve additional radars were purchased under the same contract in response to a directed procurement in July 2008.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the acquisition of up to 20 radars.  Seventeen of the 20 systems were purchased via letter contract in April 2010.  Three additional assets were procured in August 2011.  On 29 February 2012, the Government competitively awarded a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract (W15P7T-12-C-C015) for procurement of up to 54 LRIP systems.  The following table provides contract information relevant to these procurement actions. <br>  <br> Contract Number <br> Award <br> Date	Contractor	Extent Competed/ Authority <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	26 Sep 06	Lockheed Martin	Competed <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	25 Jul 08	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	12 Apr 10	Lockheed Martin	Letter Contract; award of 17 systems as part of an undefinitized contract action (UCA)  (FAR 16.302-1) <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	11 Aug 11	Lockheed Martin	UCA Definitization; award of three systems <br> (FAR 16.302-1) <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Competed <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	26 Jun 13	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br>  <br> 3.

<DESC>Title: Technical and Management Support for Health Promotion Activities
<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but not limited to, small business (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can provide scientific, technical, and management expertise, and related services involving research and demonstration projects, planning, large-scale evaluation studies, program assessments, development, and support in the execution of CDC's missions and activities in accordance with the attached Statement of Work. The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) is contemplating award of five (5) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts to support Center-wide technical and management support activities. The period of performance shall be for one 12- month base period with four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>Background and Need <br />Chronic diseases - such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis - are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the U.S. These diseases account for 7 of every 10 deaths and affect the quality of life of 90 million Americans. Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable. Adopting healthy behaviors such as eating nutritious foods, being physically active and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or control the devastating effects of these diseases.<br />CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) is at the forefront of the nation's efforts to prevent and control chronic diseases. The center conducts studies to better understand the causes of these diseases, supports programs to promote healthy behaviors, and monitors the health of the nation through surveys. Critical to the success of these efforts are partnerships with state health and education agencies, voluntary associations, private organizations, and other federal agencies. Together, the center and its partners are working to create a healthier nation<br />CDC supports a variety of programs to improve the nation's health by preventing chronic diseases and their risk factors. These programs provide national leadership by offering guidelines and recommendations and by helping state health and education agencies promote healthy behaviors. These major programs include: Arthritis, Cancer Control, Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW), Community Transformation Grants (CTG), Diabetes; Epilepsy, Healthy Communities, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), Healthy Aging, Healthy Youth, Heart Disease and Stroke , Nutrition and Physical Activity , Oral Health, Prevention Health and Health Services Block Grant (PHHS) Block Grant, Prevention Research Centers, Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH), Reproductive Health, Tobacco, WISEWOMAN, Workplace Health Promotion. <br />The CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) accomplishes its mission by providing national leadership in areas of health promotion and chronic disease prevention by conducting public health surveillance, epidemiologic studies, and behavioral interventions; by disseminating guidelines and recommendations; and by assisting state health and education agencies to increase their capacity to prevent chronic diseases and promote healthful behaviors. <br />The mission could not be accomplished without many diverse partners: state and local health and education departments; other federal health agencies; international and national health organizations; academic institutions; philanthropic foundations; industry and labor groups; and professional, voluntary and community organizations.

The purpose of this RFI is to help the FDA understand industry best practices and the technical solutions capable of fulfilling FDA's requirements as described in this RFI. This market research information will be used to assess the market's capacity and support the FDA in reaching a decision support solution.<br />FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of FDA. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the FDA's review of the information received. Additionally, the FDA does not intend to hold discussions concerning this RFI with any interested parties. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the Government's use of such information as either part of the evaluation process or for the development of specifications of a subsequent requirement. FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required. <br />PURPOSE<br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) is seeking to identify providers of laboratory services to support the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study. The Government seeks to better understand the market place of providers who possesses the technical expertise, performance capabilities, laboratory facilities (or access to), proven performance record and other information not limited to labor, material and general operating costs of responsible business concerns who have the potential to successfully perform the identified services.<br />BACKGROUND<br />On June 22, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) was signed into law. This act gives broad authority to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enact or facilitate tobacco product regulations, with the overall goals to (1) prevent Americans, particularly youth from initiating tobacco use; (2) encourage current users to quit; and (3) decrease the harms of tobacco product use.<br />In support of these mandates, the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) is partnering with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), on a large scale research collaboration, the "Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health" or PATH Study. This landmark effort is aimed at enhancing the evidence base available to FDA to inform the development and implementation of near- and long-term tobacco product regulations.<br />The PATH Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative study of tobacco use and health in the U.S. population. A cohort of approximately 59,000 adults and youth ages 12 years and older will be followed annually for three years to assess use of existing and emerging tobacco products; attitudes and perceptions related to the use of different tobacco products; and near- and longer-term health outcomes associated with tobacco product use. The study includes the collection of biospecimens among adults 18 years of age and older to examine markers of exposure and tobacco-related disease processes. Urine and whole blood will be collected and shipped to the PATH Study Repository for processing, aliquoting and long-term storage. <br />GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF ANALYZING BIOSPECIMENS FOR THE PATH STUDY <br />The Government anticipates that if this requirement is formally solicited, the following are the minimum tasks which may be required: 1) measurement of specific analytes in participant biospecimen samples collected annually over a three year data collection period; and 2) characterization of quality control (QC) pools associated with each analyte. <br />SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />Table 1. Summary of Analytes<br />Biomarker Assay Sample Matrix Preferred Test Methodology<br />Human Fibrinogen Antigen Serum ELISA<br />Human Fibrinogen Activity Plasma Clauss<br />Human IL-6 Plasma ELISA<br />Human sICAM Plasma ELISA<br />F2-Isoprostane (8-epi-PGF2a) Urine ELISA or HPLC
<p>A total of five analytes will be measured in participants' samples collected throughout the study. The analytes to be assayed and preferred methodologies are summarized in Table 1. Declarations of capabilities for individual or any combination of analytes are sought. For the analyte F2-Isoprostane, provide detailed explanation for the use of preferred method(s). <br />The tasks to be supported include:</p>
<p>Characterization of quality control (QC) pools<br />Frozen specimen pool samples will be batch shipped from the PATH Repository to the Contractor for characterization. The analytes to be assayed and preferred methodology are summarized in Table 1. The measurements shall be made in duplicate (or triplicate depending on the assay) in 20 successive analytical runs to obtain maximum among - and within -run variation to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for precision and accuracy estimates for the quality control pools. This project will include 40 quality control samples shipped in advance of participant samples. <br />Characterization of participant and blinded quality control samples<br />The Contractor will analyze specimens collected from participants in the PATH Study. Frozen specimen pool samples will be batch shipped from the PATH Repository to the Contractor for characterization. Blind QC samples will be seeded into the study participant specimens as a method of internal quality assessment for the study operations. Each sample assay should be run in duplicate or triplicate, depending on the assay. <br />Respondents are to discuss laboratory's expertise in performing specific or similar analyses of the tests listed in Table 1, the plan for characterization of the quality control pools and scenarios of analyzing batches of 2,500, 5,000 or 10,000 samples per year (over a 3 year project period*), including maximum capacity of samples per assay run and projected timeframe for completed batches; CLIA certification or equivalent certification; validation of current laboratory methods and/or the proposed validation plan for each assay; quality surveillance and monitoring plan; ability to report batch records of results in an electronic format ; management of samples including sample processing proposal and electronic tracking through the life cycle of the sample; management of equipment and facilities; any necessary information regarding specimen requirements; ability to process aliquots received in FluidX cryovial tubes stored at -80&ordm; C; ability to accept delivery of specimens on an agreed upon schedule; ability to furnish necessary personnel, materials, services and facilities required for the project and ability to retain samples for up to one month after receipt and return unused samples to the biorepository. In addition, discuss any information technology data exchange/return results including the capacity to read two-dimensional barcodes in order to track specimens and assay results. <br />*Biospecimen collection in the PATH Study varies by year. Information on years 1 and 3 should include analyte analysis from both blood and urine. Year 2 information should include analytes measured in urine only.</p>

<p>SCOPE OF WORK <br />NFFS7300-14-00181 <br />TAGGING AND BEHAVIORAL MONITORING OF SEA LIONS <br />IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IN PROXIMITY TO NAVY FACILITIES</p>
<p>NAICS 541990, $14.0 MILLION</p>
<p>PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT WITH FURTHER DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>PLEASE PROVIDE ANY QUESTIONS TO BOTH MY EMAIL AT SUZANNE.GARRETT@NOAA.GOV AND DORIS.P.TURNER@NOAA.GOV WE WILL THEN FORWARD YOUR QUESTIONS TO OUR TECHNICAL PERSON(S)</p>
<p><br />The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center has entered into an Interagency Agreement with the US Navy, Pacific Fleet Environmental to conduct a study of Tagging and Behavioral Monitoring of Sea lions in the Pacific Northwest in Proximity to Navy Facilities. Projects in the 2 year study include: Assess number of California sea lions and percentage of time animals are hauling-out each month on structures and assets near Puget Sound naval facilities at Everett, Bremerton and Bangor, assess the location of marine foraging areas and assess the foraging behavior of adult male sea lions in inland waters of Washington.</p>
<p>To accomplish these projects NMML, a contracted group or agency (Contractor) and Navy Facilities engineering Command Northwest personnel will conduct weekly surveys of sea lions hauling out at each of the three facilities. The Contractor will construct and deploy floating sea lion hauling platforms/traps at Naval Station Everett and Naval Base Kitsap, Bremerton, and monitor them for sea lion use. The Contractor will capture 30 adult male sea lions and NMML will attach satellite tags to their pelage to track their hauling and foraging behavior.</p>
<p>Specific tasks to be carried out by the contractor are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Weekly censuses of the number of California sea lion males hauled out will be conducted by the Contractor at Naval Base Kitsap Bremerton in conjunction with and coordinated with similar sea lions censuses at NAVSTA Everett by NMML staff and at Naval Base Kitsap Bangor by staff of Navy Facilities Engineering Command Northwest. To optimize the timing of those counts hourly counts will be conducted on one day each month at each location to assess diurnal patterns in number of animals hauled-out. The hour of maximum number hauled out will be used to conduct all censuses during the 2-week period. The Contractor must have a Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act Permit that allow them to conduct census activity of California and Steller Sea Lions including "takes" by harassment.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor must have expertise and experience in designing and operating floating sea lion traps. The Contractor will provide to NMML specifications of a hauling platform and trap. The Contractor will install a 16 X 16 foot hauling platform and trap at NAVSTA Everett and Bremerton by anchoring it to the ocean bottom.</p>
<p><br />&bull; To estimate the proportion of time hauled out and locations of foraging areas the Contractor will provide 3 biologists who with assistance of NMML staff will capture 30 or more adult male California sea lions in Puget Sound on a floating trap and attach satellite tags to the pelage of restrained animal. The Contractor's personnel must have expertise and experience capturing and handling large and dangerous adult male California and Steller Sea lion in the wild. Demonstrated experience handling adult male California sea lions is required to assure personnel safety and animal care considerations.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will assist NMML staff in retrieval of instrument packages from sea lions. Sea lions undergo annual migration between Washington and rookeries in California and in August undergo a molt during which the instrument packs will fall off. Aerial and boat surveys will be used to recovery instruments in coastal California, Oregon and Washington. The Contractor must have experience in tracking instruments with VHF radio tags from aircraft and vessels.</p>
<p><br />&bull; The Contractor will assist NMML staff with reporting and publication of findings. <br />1. Annual reports required by 15 May 2014 and 15 May 2015 within the NMFS/Navy Interagency Agreement. The Contractor's contributions will be due 1 May each year.<br />2. Comprehensive report due 30 September 2015 with the following elements:</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will provide a quarterly report of census data of adult male haul out at NAVSTA Kitsap Bremerton</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will assist with calculation of monthly correction factors for count data from NAVSTA Everett or other trapping location by species as appropriate</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will prepare a report on geographical distribution and foraging behavior of California sea lion adult males in inland waters of Washington (and Steller Sea Lions if tagged).</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will prepare a report on migration and foraging behavior of California sea lions in coastal Washington, Oregon and California (and Steller Sea Lions, if tagged).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUCEMENT ONLY. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, bids, or quotations. At this time, NO PROJECT PLANS OR SPECIFICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method. The Point Reyes Major Acquisition Buying Office in the Pacific West Region of the National Park Service is conducting market research to understand the numbers and types of contractors who have the capability and are interested in performing laboratory analysis of drinking water systems, wastewater systems and swim beach water quality samples for Whiskeytown National Recreational Area, Shasta County, California.
The U.S. Department of Interior, National Park Service is contemplating the issuance of a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for laboratory service. These laboratory tests must be conducted by a State of California certified laboratory and meet EPA requirements, and actions.  Water sampling conducted at Whiskeytown for example includes monthly routine, special and raw water samples for the presence or absence of coliforms in drinking water.  Testing of raw source water is conducted monthly for Total Coliforms and Ecoli.  Raw samples and wastewater samples are required to be processed within the holding time to comply with EPA requirements of being taken.  Beach samples are also raw samples within the holding time established by the EPA.  State of California requires scheduled monitoring of Inorganics, Nitrates and Nitrites, radiological, Total Trihalomethanes, Haloacetic Acids, Lead and Copper for Whiskeytown. 
Additional flexibility in lab scheduling (with short notice) is needed for the unpredictable nature of seasonal storm sampling or an accidental discharge; sample drop-off may be necessary on weekends, requiring a local drop-off site within reasonable driving distance (one hour) from Whiskeytown NRA headquarters. Stringent hold times are established in our monitoring protocol, so timely processing of samples must be guaranteed before beginning field work. The main parameters to be tested will be those samples requiring results for determination for additional sampling. Proper chain of custody procedures should be utilized, and reported with each set of sample results (results should be faxed as soon as possible and a hard copy sent within two weeks of known sampling results). Technical support and sampling guidance over the phone may be needed occasionally. There is also a need for approximately 100 sample bottles per month be provided for routine sampling that will need to be picked up and provide replacement sampling bottles.  The laboratory must provide the correct sample bottle size for samples requiring a specific quantity for testing.
Interested contractors able to perform the type of work detailed above should PROVIDE THEIR COMPANY OR ENTITY NAME, ADDRESS, DUNS, AND CONTACT INFORMATION FOR PRIMARY POINTS OF CONTACT, AND ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION DEMONSTRATING YOUR CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THE WORK to NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, ATTN: Liset Gomez, Contract Specialist, Point Reyes National Seashore, 1 Bear Valley Road, Point Reyes Station, CA 94956, or email to Liset_Gomez@nps.gov. ALL INFORMATION MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE NO LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS NOVEMEBER 29, 2013. 
Interested contractors must be currently registered (or be able to be registered prior to any future award) in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the official SAM website www.sam.gov (SAM registration is FREE - beware fraudulent websites posing as SAM and attempting to collect registration fee). Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.

<DESC>Mobile Communications Acquisition RFI Synopsis
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG), in conjunction with its customer, the Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations (OTSO)/Division of Integrated Telecommunication Management (DITM), is currently performing market research to determine the availability of sources to provide a Cellular Phone/Smartphone solution for the agency. We are looking for sources capable of providing Service Enabling Devices (SED), airtime, and support.</p>
<p>DITM manages many of the smartphones, cell phones, pagers and broadband cards throughout SSA. Additionally, DITM is the main point of contact with the current in-building systems in place that enhance signal strength throughout many of SSA's buildings. These locations are located in the main Headquarters campus in Woodlawn, MD and in Durham, NC.</p>
<p>The SSA continues to support and purchase smartphones. Currently, there are nearly 4,500 BlackBerrys being utilized across the agency. The agency purchases hand-held units and accessories, licenses and usage fees. These support SSA's executives, senior staff, senior management staff and technical support staff, as well as selected knowledge worker positions requiring extensive mobility and communication. The smartphones allow users to access and manage SSA e-mail, calendars, tasks, notes, address books and the Internet. In addition, these smartphones have built-in cellular phones and the ability to emulate a pager. These features allow SSA staff to work more efficiently and effectively while away from their workstation.</p>
<p>The SSA has a continuing need for cellular phones. We anticipate the inventory of cellular phones to remain stable through FY 2018. OTSO receives requests for cellular phones from management for technical staff that provide after-hours support in situations where a BlackBerry or smartphone is not necessary.</p>
<p>OTSO currently provides local and national paging services for those employees that require minimal communication, either on an occasional basis or to gain alerts from various automated systems. OTSO provides both numeric and alphanumeric paging capabilities with options for basic paging, one-way text messaging via a web page or e-mail account, and two-way paging. The two-way pagers allow users to communicate with other two-way users or e-mail users immediately without the need for a phone, Personal Computer, or Personal Digital Assistant.</p>
<p>Broadband cards are used to quickly and easily transform a laptop into a mobile office by allowing access to the Internet and e-mail, including attachments; almost anywhere a wireless signal is received. Currently, there are approximately 200 broadband cards in service at SSA Headquarters.</p>
<p>A large number of executives and support staff at SSA are using cellular and BlackBerry services in the buildings in which they work. Therefore, demand for reliable in-building cellular service is increasing as more people acquire wireless devices. Currently, the locations that have an in-building system are located in the main Headquarters campus in Woodlawn, MD and in Durham, NC. As we go forward, there is a need to have in-building coverage in most of our buildings on campus.</p>
<p>We request information from businesses that believe they have a bona-fide capability to meet the agency's cellphone/smartphone requirements. Specifically, interested firms should submit the following information:</p>
<p>1) General Information:Include the company name, address, point of contact name, point of contact number, DUNS Number, business size status for the indicated NAICS code.</p>

The responses to this Notice will be used for planning purposes for an upcoming procurement. Therefore, this Notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP); it does not guarantee the future issue of a RFP; nor does it commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, this Agency will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that this Agency will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this Notice; all costs associated with responding to this Notice will be solely at the responding party's expense. At this time, proprietary information is not being requested, and respondents shall refrain from providing proprietary information in response to this Notice.

Not responding to this Notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this Notice. <br>  <br> GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS: <br>  <br> The Chicagoland Underflow Plan (CUP) McCook Reservoir project is being implemented to reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and flooding in the areas served by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago's (MWRDGC) Mainstream and Des Plaines Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP) systems. The McCook Reservoir is located at the MWRDGC Lawndale Avenue Solids Management Area (LASMA) site.  In order to minimize flood damages to the City of Chicago and 36 surrounding suburban communities, the reservoir will store excess CSO water from TARP's Mainstream and Des Plaines Deep Tunnel systems until the floodwaters levels recede. <br>  <br> Project Labor Agreements (PLA) may be required for various McCook construction projects within the Willow Springs, IL geographical area. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a PLA is tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects; (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> PLANNED CONSTRUCTION PROJECT/ACQUISITION: <br>   <br> Should this Agency issue a formal solicitation for this planned project/acquisition, prospective offerors will be required to submit enough technical information to allow an in-depth technical analysis of their proposed systems. <br>  <br> Project Information: The Stage 2 Slopes will consist of overburden slopes being retained by walls along two sides of the reservoir with permanent slope stabilization. The McCook Reservoir is located in a limestone quarry and mining operations will be concurrent with the construction of the retaining walls. The work includes the following major components: <br>  	Overburden Slopes - 40 ft to 50 ft of overburden soils consisting of silty clay fill overlying hardpan. The slopes along the canal side are roughly graded to 2.5H:1V and the river side slopes are graded to 2H:1V. There is a concrete work platform at the top of the slope on the canal side and a roadway at of the top of the riverside slope. Vegetation removal and grading will be required along with excavation for construction of the retaining wall. Pumping of surface water will be needed. <br>  	Retaining Walls - 950 LF of soil nail wall and 1,900 cast-in-place reinforced concrete T-wall up to 20 ft in height. The wall heights vary based on the rock surface. Impacts to an existing slurry wall in the riverside slope need to be avoided. Backfill will consist of stone for the concrete wall. Concurrent construction and completion of 500 LF of retaining walls along both the river side and canal side is required within a 3.5 month period. <br>  	Permanent Slope Stabilization - Geocellular confinement system on the overburden slopes with stone infill will be installed once the retaining walls have been completed. <br>  	Rock Bench - Cleaning of the top of rock surface and removal of fractured rock. Sealing of joints. <br>  <br> SCOPE OF CAPABILITIES: <br>  <br> The USACE-Chicago District is searching for contractors that are capable of meeting all of the above requirements. <br>  <br> REQUESTED INFORMATION: <br>  <br> Since this notice is being used to assess the extent of Firms capable of fulfilling the government's requirements, this Agency requests that interested contractors complete the following questions to assist the government in its efforts: <br>  <br> 1.

<ARCHDATE>01042014
<CONTACT>Donna Berkowitz, Contracting Officer, Email donna.berkowitz@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with Schindler Elevator Corporation for the operation, maintenance and repair of the Schindler Miconic "A" elevators in the NRC's Two White Flint North (TWFN) Building in Rockville, MD. The period of performance will be for a base year and four option years beginning on May 6, 2014. Schindler Elevator Corporation is uniquely qualified to provide this service because Schindler Elevator Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the elevator systems installed in NRC's TWFN Building. The software, circuitry charts, and diagnostic equipment used for program analysis and troubleshooting are proprietary to Schindler, and as such, are unavailable for use by any other elevator maintenance company for maintaining and servicing elevators. Any attempts by any other company to maintain the elevator systems without the use of the Schindler proprietary software would inevitably lead to malfunctions, delays, and problems that could impact the health and safety of the NRC employees.
<p>Additionally, upgrades to the elevator equipment and software that have been installed by Schindler on the nine (9) elevator systems were either designed and/or engineered by Schindler, such as the surge protection system, which was designed to prevent elevator outages during severe thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The ability to communicate and interface with the Miconic A SSD processor and software requires a CADI tool. Schindler Elevator has sole ownership of the CADI tool and any related patents. In addition, there is a key that operates the entire software system and is required for access into the system to make changes, repairs and upgrades. The CADI tool and software key are both owned by Schindler Elevator and are not available to other elevator companies. The two tools listed above are absolutely necessary for the elevator system to operate properly.</p>
<p>In addition to the tools, the actual software for this elevator system is proprietary to Schindler Elevator. Although a diagnostic tool is available on the open market, it serves only as an informative tool to anyone besides Schindler Elevator. Should any software need repair or upgrade, Schindler is the only company that is able to upgrade or repair any software issues. Further, since the equipment was custom designed by Schindler Elevator for NRC, the software is extremely specific and another elevator company would not have the capability to modify, upgrade or repair it. Additionally, Schindler Elevator provides software enhancements and upgrades effecting safety and reliability at no cost to the government. These upgrades and enhancements are only available from Schindler Elevator.</p>
<p>As an added feature, Schindler Elevator has a remote monitoring tool that will monitor the elevators 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The system provides interactive communication with the controllers to identify and diagnose elevator faults. Through this remote system, a technician will be automatically dispatched directly from the SRM upon indication of a failure.<br /><br />Schindler's Advanced Diagnostic Support System (ADSS for short) also provides an action plan of faults to check and verify in order to pinpoint the root cause of the fault. This feature assists in correcting the specific problem the first time therefore reducing repeated service calls. This feature is exclusive to Schindler Elevator. Although other elevator companies offer remote monitoring systems, no other system can be installed on the Miconic A equipment. Schindler's approach to remote monitoring has been shown to reduce the return to service by approximately 25% as opposed to non-SRM units. Schindler's SRM is the only remote monitoring unit that can be retrofitted on non -Schindler units with all of the above capabilities. The SRM system was developed by and remains the property of Schindler Elevator.<br />The authority to enter into a contract on a sole-source basis with Otis Elevator is made under the authority of 41 U.S. C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238290 - Other Building Equipment Contractors. This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the below address not later than 15 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Thirty-seven Phase-2 PVC 1/8" White 7.2" x 1 &frac12;" Rib 47-7/8" x 12' roof replacement panels, sixteen Phase-2 PVC 1/8" White 7.2" x 1 &frac12;" Rib 47-7/8" x 14' roof replacement panels, sixteen Phase-2 PVC 1/8" White 7.2" x 1 &frac12;" Rib 47-7/8" x 10' roof replacement panels, one hundred thirty-two Phase-2 PVC 1/8" White 7.2" x 1 &frac12;" Rib 47-7/8" x 7'11" roof replacement panels, twelve Phase-2 PVC 1/8" White 7.2" x 1 &frac12;" Rib 47-7/8" x 8'5" roof replacement panels, twelve Phase-2 PVC 1/8" White 7.2" x 1 &frac12;" Rib 47-7/8" x 7'5"' roof replacement panels are needed by DHS, FEMA, MWEOC to replace the existing roofing panels. The MWEOC Fire Department has approved the corrugated roofing with a non-combustible flame spread rating of 12. This rating is required to ensure the safety of the Operations and Management staff as well as the structural integrity of the diesel shop. MWEOC is also standardizing materials used on site and this product has been used on other structures on site. This standardization eliminates the need to stock spare materials from other manufacturer's which saves valuable warehouse space. The manufacturer who provides these roof replacement panels must be able to meet the non-combustible flame spread rating of 12 and also meet the color, size and style described above. H &amp; F Manufacturing Corporation in Ivyland, PA is believed to be the only Manufacturer capable of providing the required products. Companies, who believe they can meet the above specifications, are requested to contact Thomas Crouch via email at Thomas.Crouch@fema.dhs.gov or by fax to 540-542-2631, no later than November 25, 2013. Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<SUBJECT>Proposers' Day Announcement for IARPA's JANUS Program

<RESPDATE>061013
<CONTACT>Dr Mark J. Burge, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-13-07@iarpa.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for Janus on June 13, 2013 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 to 3:30 in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the Janus program and the research problems that the program aims to address, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS</p>
<p>Intelligence analysts often rely on facial images to assist in establishing the identity of an individual, but too often, just examining the sheer volume of possibly relevant images and videos can be daunting. While biometric tools like automated face recognition could assist analysts in this task, current tools perform best on the well-posed, frontal facial photos taken for identification purposes. IARPA's Janus program aims to dramatically improve the current performance of face recognition tools by fusing the rich spatial, temporal, and contextual information available from the multiple views captured by today's "media in the wild".</p>
<p>The program is seeking to fund rigorous, high-quality research which uses innovative and promising approaches drawn from a variety of fields to develop novel representational models capable of encoding the shape, texture, and dynamics of a face. Instead of relying on a "single best frame approach," these representations must address the challenges of Aging, Pose, Illumination, and Expression (A-PIE) by exploiting all available imagery. Technologies must support analysts working with partial information by addressing the uncertainties which arise when working with possibly incomplete, erroneous, and ambiguous data. The goal of the program is to test and validate techniques which have the potential to significantly improve the performance of biometric recognition in unconstrained imagery, to that end, the program will involve empirical testing of recognition performance across unconstrained videos, camera stills, and scanned photos exhibiting a broad range of real-world imaging conditions.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that successful teams will transcend conventional approaches to biometric recognition by drawing on the multidisciplinary expertise of researchers from the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning; computer vision and image processing; computer graphics and animation; mathematical statistics and modeling; and data visualization and analytics.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST June 10th, 2013 at http://events.SignUp4.com/JANUSPD_Info. Directions to the conference facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 150 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a visit request form for Foreign Nationals at least 5 business days prior to the conference. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website. Foreign nationals will need to present a passport.</p>
<p><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation and Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for teaming opportunities may submit a request through the registration web site. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the conference has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), or any other similar organizations that have a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged or proprietary information, or access to Government equipment or real property, will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.<br />The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC-ML) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2913, which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation. This contract is referred to as a Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC). For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated. <br />This project provides for energy efficiency upgrades at several buildings within the Hadnot Point/French Creek area of Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina (MCB Camp Lejeune). The primary goal of the project is to reduce energy consumption and provide more sustainable building infrastructure at MCB Camp Lejeune. These improvements will be accomplished by removing approximately 54 buildings from the existing central steam plant and related steam distribution system and and upgrade associated energy conservation opportunities within each facility (such as the industrial controls system). The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC which include but are not limited to the engineering and design phase; the implementation phase. The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms at least as good as those available to customers in a comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile. Therefore, the Utility will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long-term (10-15 year) amortization schedule.<br />Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration. The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Responses to this posting must be submitted to Lawrence.Scheible@navy.mil in PDF format no later than 5 December 2013. <br />Point of Contact: Lawrence Scheible, Contract Specialist, Phone (757) 341-0175.

Extreme care and attention should be given to ensure that all necessary items are included in the proposal.  <br>  <br> L.1.1 CLAUSE FILL-INS:   Some clauses require the offeror to fill in information. Pay particular attention to 52.247-60 GUARANTEED SHIPPING CHARACTERISTICS and 52.246-4028 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE POINTS: ORIGIN as that information will be used by the Government to calculate transportation costs.  A completed copy of clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, must be included with your proposal. <br>  <br> L.2 TECHNICAL INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE (TIQ):  The offeror shall complete each section of the TIQ (Attachment 0002).  Failure to complete every section of the TIQ may render your offer ineligible for award.  <br>  <br> L.2.1 ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL CAPABILITY INFORMATION: In addition to completing the TIQ regarding the Ambulance being proposed, the offeror shall support its responses by electronically submitting supporting documentation where indicated on the TIQ.   <br>  <br> L.3 CLIN STRUCTURE and PRICE INFORMATION: The offeror shall legibly fill-in, in U.S. Dollars, the Unit Price column and the total Amount column for all CLIN numbers 0001AA - 0003AA on Attachment 0003 and Spare Parts Lists in Attachment 0004. <br>  <br> SECTION-M EVALUATION: <br>  <br> M.1 BASIS Of AWARD:  The Government will award a single Firm-Fixed-Price contract for an ambulance to the responsible offeror that is assessed as Acceptable in the Technical Capability Factor with the Lowest Total Evaluated Price.  <br>  <br> M.1.2 EVALUATION:  The evaluation will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.6 ( quote mark Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items quote mark ).  There are two factors:  (1) Price and (2) Technical Capability.  The Government intends to conduct a price evaluation, to include transportation costs, on all proposals.  The Government will then conduct a technical capability review of the lowest total evaluated price proposal.  If the lowest price proposal is determined to be Unacceptable, then the Government will conduct a technical capability review on the next lowest price proposal.  Unless the Government determines it is in its best interests to conduct discussions, the Government will follow this process until the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal is identified.      <br>  <br> M.1.3 TECHNICAL CAPABILITY FACTOR:  For an offeror to be eligible for award, its proposal must be assessed as Acceptable under each section of the Technical Information Questionnaire (TIQ) (Attachment 002).  Offerors found to be Unacceptable under any section of the TIQ will not be considered for award.  To determine Acceptability,  <br>  <br> (1)	the Offeror's response must indicate it can meet each requirement on the TIQ; and <br>  <br> (2)	where supporting documentation is required, the Government will review the information submitted to confirm that the Offeror is capable of meeting the requirement.  <br>  <br> An Acceptable proposal is one which clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  An Unacceptable proposal is one which does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>  <br> M.1.4 PRICE FACTOR:  The information submitted in response to Section L.3 will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of the offeror's total evaluated price.  A price is considered reasonable if it does not exceed what would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.    The total evaluated price will consist of the total sum of all CLIN numbers 0001AA - 0003AA and the transportation costs as determined by the ACC-Warren Transportation Office for all FOB origin CLINs (base only). <br>  <br> M.1.5 DISCUSSIONS:  In accordance with FAR clause 52.212-1(g), the Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical capability standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  In addition, the Government reserves the right, without entering discussions, to request additional information necessary to support the offeror's price in order to determine price reasonableness. <br>  <br> Offers are due no later than 2 December 2013, 1600 local time Warren, MI. Quotations must be submitted electronically Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI).  No phone calls will be accepted.   <br>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Skin Staplers. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MP-1201-21_Skin_Staplers are eligible for participation. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Skin Staplers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This RFIAQ is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MP-1201-21_Skin_Staplers. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from DAPA prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is January 2014. Among vendors who are on the QSL MP-1201-21_Skin_Staplers, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Skin Staplers.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Skin Staplers. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $678,605.57 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL MP-1201-21_Skin_Staplers who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this RFIAQ via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Pacific via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet</strong>. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br />Skin Staplers pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full by the response date of this RFIAQ. Vendors not currently on the QSL for Skin Staplers will not be considered for an IA. Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the QSL FBO MP-1201-21_Skin_Staplers. Vendor must provide responses to the RFIAQ via the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</p>
<p>1. Vendor must provide pricing for the following items listed in response to the SA FBO posting. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price. Vendors are required to supply pricing for all items listed in the table below, as qualified on the QSL.</p>
<p>Item Descriptions / Units (Individual Wipes)<br />Skin Staplers, sterile, disposable, fixed head, preloaded with 35 wide, surgical grade stainless steel staples. / 92515<br />Skin Staplers, sterile, disposable, fixed head, preloaded with 35 regular, surgical grade stainless steel staples. / 12312</p>
<p>2. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the SA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.</p>

<CONTACT>Treva Jones, Phone 202 283-1342, Fax -1290, Email treva.l.jones@irs.gov
<DESC>The IRS anticipates issuing a fixed price single award for the Annual Maintenance on the Oce VP4110 Printer. The period of performance is November 24, 2013 - November 23, 2014. Award will be made to the Offeror whose quote has been determined to provide the best value. Under this RFQ, best value will result from the selection of the technically acceptable quote with the lowest evaluated price. Offerors providing the required brand name maintenance will be considered technically acceptable.
<p>See the attached SF18 Request for Quotations for specific supplies/services for additional line items.</p>
<p>Basis for Award<br /><br />The Government will make award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror. The technical factors are not being assigned a point score but instead the proposal shall be considered for award if it meets the minimum criteria set forth in the RFP.<br /><br />As compared to the best value approach, the principal advantage of the "lowest price technically acceptable" basis is simplicity. It reduces the burden on both the contractor community (to prepare and submit a proposal) and the Government (to evaluate each proposal and justify a source selection). It also creates the appearance of greater objectivity and fairness.</p>
<p>Instructions</p>
<p>All resellers/manufacturers that can deliver and/or perform the equivalent products/services shall submit a written quotation which includes any applicable discounts; along with the completed IRS Price Quotation Sheet on or before 3:00pm November 21, 2013. The Vendor shall be selected based on the lowest priced technically acceptable quote. All quotes shall include: Price(s), FOB Point of Contact (name and telephone number), delivery date(s), business size, payment terms, Taxpayer Identification Number and Dun &amp; Bradstreet number. All products/services must be in compliance with Section 508 1194.31 and 1194.41 of the Rehabilitation Act. Vendors shall provide proof of conformance through the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT).<br />Offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.com.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted by email to Treva.L.Paris@irs.gov.</p>

<CONTACT> Robert Cortez, Contracting Officer, Phone 5013013222, Fax 855-747-7797, Email robert.cortez@ar.usda.gov
<DESC>Rural Development in Arkansas has a continuing need for single family housing appraisals, and intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to small business individuals/firms capable of providing these services.
<p>A BPA is not a contract and creates no contractual obligation on either the Government or you as a Contractor. Therefore, the Government is not obligated to place any orders, nor is the contractor obligated to accept any orders. Appraisal services will be requested by issuing a BPA call order via an Order Ticket for each work assignment required.</p>
<p>Please refer to the attachments for standards and requirements for a detailed explanation of the BPA terms and conditions, and then complete Items 17a &amp; b, and 30a - c, as applicable on Standard Form 1449, and also the information required on pages 6, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21 &amp; 22 of the BPA, if you would like to be considered under the BPA for Fiscal year 2013. This information, along with the qualification and licensing information indicated in Item A.3 Standards on Page 3 and also Item 13 on Page 27-28 of the BPA will need to be returned to me by 3:00 PM CST on Tuesday, December 10, 2013.</p>
<p>Please note: All vendors must maintain an active registration in the System for Acquisition Management (SAM), which was previously known as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and On-line Representation and Certification Application (ORCA), in order to be eligible for an award. If you had an active record in CCR, you automatically have an active record in SAM. You do not need to do anything UNLESS a change in your business circumstances requires updates to your Entity record(s). In this case, you will need to make the applicable changes in SAM. You should receive notifications from SAM via email 60, 30, and 15 days prior to your registration expiration. Please check out <br /><a href="http://www.SAM.gov">www.SAM.gov</a> for additional SAM requirements and information.</p>

Government plans to provide Amendment to solicitation on 12 November with specific quantity size requirements (SEE NEXT DATE). <br /><br />***06 December 2013Interested parties provide Government with data results of thermal protection testing and windblast testing. Government anticipates updating quantity and size requirements to the (15 Oct 13) posted solicitation. Parties that are unable to meet this due date for the windblast test results and thermal values will be unable to participate. This particular data modeling is the only test of its kind and is only offered to the Government for a single testing time period. It is imperative that interested parties meet this date for submission. Rational for timeframe is done in a sequence and in order to meet the Qualified Product List publish date, the Government MUST have all interested parties' data submissions in at this time. <br /><br />7 January 2014 Government provides interested parties that have participated fully to date, the results from their company's particular data modeling tests.</p>
<p>11 March 2014, CWAS proposal is DUE from Offeror<br />NLT 1630 EST Offeror's proposal should be valid for 90 calendar days. Delivery for test assets should be anticipated to be delivered FOB Destination, within 120 days after award.</p>
<p>Government will evaluate all proposals on:<br />&bull; Technical Acceptability - ensemble must pass all testing requirements of the attached P-Spec to be considered acceptable<br />&bull; Past Performance - See FAR 13.106<br />&bull; Price - the lowest, single unit price and reasonableness</p>
<p>WHEN SUBMITTING PRICING SHEET. PRICES SHOULD BE PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>1) UNIT Price - Price of all "layers" of your ensemble. Please include price breaks, up to 100 quantity units. ****Government will evaluate all proposals based on the price of one SINGLE unit.****</p>
<p>2) Price PER EACH LAYER of your model should also be provided (i.e. if you have a model that consists of more than one layer what would be the price if the Government were to buy each layer separately, etc). If you DO NOT OFFER the layers priced out separately please state that on your proposal. Price breaks offered for multiple quantities should be included if applicable, up to 100 units.</p>
<p>(a) The Government intends to award contracts to one or more contractors, depending on availability of funding, who successfully demonstrate that they passed the testing requirements of the attached Performance Specification (P-Spec) and conform to this solicitation. Offerors shall complete the attached P-Spec Compliance Worksheet supported by actual test reports, Certificates of Compliance for all Components (P-Spec para. 3.4).</p>
<p>(b) In the synopsis posted to FedBizOpps on 17 Sept 2013, interested vendors were requested to advise the Contracting Office of their intent to participate no later than 30 Sept 2013. If interested vendors were not able to advise the Contracting Office of their intent to participate by the date requested, vendors will not be excluded from participating in this solicitation as long as they meet the requirements of this solicitation by the proposal due date. This shall be a firm fixed price effort and is set aside for small business.</p>
<p>(c) The P-Spec requires that windblast testing (para 4.11.1) be completed first. Then, thermal protection testing (para. 4.10.2) should be completed using both the windblasted ensemble and a new, non-windblasted ensemble. If the interested parties want to continue to participate, all of the previously discussed testing results will be provided to the Government to complete additional data modeling at no cost. Data results from these tests, as well as photos (for the purposes of this evaluation photos are considered data) of the garments before and after windblast, should be provided at no cost to the Government by 12 Nov 2013. The Government will, at its expense, conduct Six Cylinder Thermoregulation Data Modeling which will take approximately 60 days. This test will determine if the ensemble meets the cold weather objective/threshold required in the P-Spec (para. 3.11.2). Once testing is complete, the results will be provided to the interested party. The determination to continue testing, while the Government performs the modeling, is strictly at the interested party's discretion. The Government will not reimburse the interested party for the costs of their testing. Those ensembles that successfully pass Six Cylinder Thermoregulation Data Modeling and pass all of the other material, end item, and systems level tests outlined in the P-Spec will potentially be purchased for use in Government run aircraft integration testing; if funding is available at the time of award. The Government only intends to purchase sufficient assets to perform integration testing, subject to the availability of funding.</p>
<p>(d) After testing is complete and if funding is available at the time it is anticipated that a firm fixed price contract will be awarded to one or more product "systems" which meet the technical requirements provided in the P-SPEC. If a down-selection is required due to funding limitations the pricing evaluation laid out in 1) above applies. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror(s) within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />This acquisition will be conducted as a Small Business Set-aside (FAR 19.502-2(b)) under North American Industry Classification System Code 315210. The size standard is 500. Any small businesses who partner with a large business are reminded that they are required to perform 50% of the work on the effort to be eligible for consideration (FAR clause 52.219-8). To clarify, since we are only purchasing test assets in this case, at least 50% of the test assets in this case must be manufactured by the small business partner.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE CLAUSES:</p>
<p>1352.201-70, CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (APRIL 2010) <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />STATEMENT OF NEED - NWWT9386-14-00450<br />HELIUM DELIVERY AND CYLINDER RENTAL<br />FOR WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE LAS VEGAS, NV</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Las Vegas, Nevada launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 3am and 3pm PST (4am and 4pm PDT). Each balloon requires approximately 82 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of helium (between 1,148 and 3,600 CF) to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the NWS office located at 7851 Dean Martin Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89139. The total amount of helium to be delivered for this requirement is approximately 2,400 CF (two six-packs) about every other week (between 59,860 and 72,800 CF annually).</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning January 15, 2014 and ending January 14, 2015.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office located at 7851 Dean Martin Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89139. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building, located behind our locked gated fence; just north of our office building.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All helium must be provided in six packs as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to three 6-packs of helium at a time. It is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 1,148 and 3,600 CF of helium, with a minimum of 2,296 CF being used every other week.</p>
<p>Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section 9 below, shall coordinate the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the helium being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: The National Weather Service will contact the Contractor when two 6-packs are empty, and request the pickup of the empty 6-packs and delivery of an identical number of full 6-packs of helium. The Contractor shall perform the pickup and delivery in the same trip and within two business days of being contacted. Actual helium usage and delivery frequency depends on how many cubic feet of helium are provided in each 6-pack, and also has the potential to vary if we have to launch extra balloons. But, at 1,200 CF per six-pack, and no extra launches, we will need deliveries roughly twice a month.</p>
<p>Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.</p>
<p>Performing Deliveries: For the initial delivery, the Contractor shall supply to the Place of Performance three 6-packs of helium, a minimum of 3,600 CF, in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule. Thereafter, The National Weather Service will contact the Contractor when two 6-packs are empty, and request the pickup of the empty 6-packs and delivery of an identical number of full 6-packs of helium. The Contractor shall perform the pickup and delivery in the same trip and within two business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. A loading and unloading area is available at this location such that a 6-pack can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the packs are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of helium within the time specified), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>7. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>8. POINTS OF CONTACT</p>
<p>The Government contacts at the NWS office in Las Vegas, NV are:</p>
<p>Meteorologist In Charge - Todd Lericos, 702-263-9744 x 222, todd.lericos@noaa.gov<br />Alternate 1 - Stan Czyzyk, 702-263-9744 x224, stanley.czyzyk@noaa.gov<br />Alternate 2 - Dan Berc, 702-263-9744 x223, daniel.berc@noaa.gov</p>
<p>9. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's hydrogen deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />f. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices may be sent to the following address:</p>

The SCM effort consists of forecasting, repairing, acquiring, stocking, storing, issuing, and transporting all the parts necessary to support F117 depot overhaul.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AMENDMENT 01</span></strong> to Proposers' Day Announcement for IARPA's JANUS Program - IARPA-BAA-13-07<br /><br />The subject amendment is issued to revise the registration date for the subject proposer's day and to remove the Visit Request Form requirement.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REVISED PROPOSER'S DAY ANNOUNCEMENT:<br /><br /></span></strong>Janus Proposers' Day Conference
<p>SYNOPSIS<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for Janus on June 13, 2013 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 to 3:30 in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the Janus program and the research problems that the program aims to address, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS</p>
<p>Intelligence analysts often rely on facial images to assist in establishing the identity of an individual, but too often, just examining the sheer volume of possibly relevant images and videos can be daunting. While biometric tools like automated face recognition could assist analysts in this task, current tools perform best on the well-posed, frontal facial photos taken for identification purposes. IARPA's Janus program aims to dramatically improve the current performance of face recognition tools by fusing the rich spatial, temporal, and contextual information available from the multiple views captured by today's "media in the wild".</p>
<p>The program is seeking to fund rigorous, high-quality research which uses innovative and promising approaches drawn from a variety of fields to develop novel representational models capable of encoding the shape, texture, and dynamics of a face. Instead of relying on a "single best frame approach," these representations must address the challenges of Aging, Pose, Illumination, and Expression (A-PIE) by exploiting all available imagery. Technologies must support analysts working with partial information by addressing the uncertainties which arise when working with possibly incomplete, erroneous, and ambiguous data. The goal of the program is to test and validate techniques which have the potential to significantly improve the performance of biometric recognition in unconstrained imagery, to that end, the program will involve empirical testing of recognition performance across unconstrained videos, camera stills, and scanned photos exhibiting a broad range of real-world imaging conditions.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that successful teams will transcend conventional approaches to biometric recognition by drawing on the multidisciplinary expertise of researchers from the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning; computer vision and image processing; computer graphics and animation; mathematical statistics and modeling; and data visualization and analytics.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST June 6, 2013 at:</p>
<p>http://events.SignUp4.com/JANUSPD_Info</p>
<p>Directions to the conference facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 150 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation and Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for teaming opportunities may submit a request through the registration web site. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the conference has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 12 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), or any other similar organizations that have a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged or proprietary information, or access to Government equipment or real property, will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p><br />Questions concerning conference and registration can be sent to dni-iarpa-events@iarpa.gov.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-13-07@iarpa.gov.</p>

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support plans to establish a five year Long Term Contract (LTC) N00383-14-R-0002 for the repair of 1 item in support of P-3. The estimated amount for the life of the contract is $2,107,800.00. A list of the items has been uploaded with this synopsis as an Attachment A. The line items listed on Attachment A, can be repaired by various sources and the place of performance has yet to be determined. There are multiple sources that possess full repair capability of this item. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
  For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Scott Paris at (215) 697-2582.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

          CONTRACTOR RULES OF BEHAVIOR
This User Agreement contains rights and authorizations regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This User Agreement covers my access to all VA data whether electronic or hard copy ("Data"), VA information systems and resources ("Systems"), and VA sites ("Sites"). This User Agreement incorporates Rules of Behavior for using VA, and other information systems and resources under the contract.
1. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ALL ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CONTRACT:
a.	I understand and agree that I have no reasonable expectation of privacy in accessing or using any VA, or other Federal Government information systems.
b.	I consent to reviews and actions by the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) staff designated and authorized by the VA Chief Information Officer (CIO) and to the VA OIG regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA. These actions may include monitoring, recording, copying, inspecting, restricting access, blocking, tracking, and disclosing to all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel as directed by the VA CIO without my prior consent or notification.
c.	I consent to reviews and actions by authorized VA systems administrators and Information Security Officers solely for protection of the VA infrastructure, including, but not limited to monitoring, recording, auditing, inspecting, investigating, restricting access, blocking, tracking, disclosing to authorized personnel, or any other authorized actions by all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel.
d.	I understand and accept that unauthorized attempts or acts to access, upload, change, or delete information on Federal Government systems; modify Federal government systems; deny access to Federal government systems; accrue resources for unauthorized use on Federal government systems; or otherwise misuse Federal government systems or resources are prohibited.
e.	I understand that such unauthorized attempts or acts are subject to action that may result in criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. This includes penalties for violations of Federal laws including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) and 18 U.S.C. 2701 (unlawful access to stored communications).
f.	I agree that OI&T staff, in the course of obtaining access to information or systems on my behalf for performance under the contract, may provide information about me including, but not limited to, appropriate unique personal identifiers such as date of birth and social security number to other system administrators, Information Security Officers (ISOs), or other authorized staff without further notifying me or obtaining additional written or verbal permission from me.
g.	I understand I must comply with VA's security and data privacy directives and handbooks. I understand that copies of those directives and handbooks can be obtained from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). If the contractor believes the policies and guidance provided by the COTR is a material unilateral change to the contract, the contractor must elevate such concerns to the Contracting Officer for resolution.
h.	I will report suspected or identified information security/privacy incidents to the COTR and to the local ISO or Privacy Officer as appropriate.
2. GENERAL RULES OF BEHAVIOR
a.	Rules of Behavior are part of a comprehensive program to provide complete information security. These rules establish standards of behavior in recognition of the fact that knowledgeable users are the foundation of a successful security program. Users must understand that taking personal responsibility for the security of their computer and the information it contains is an essential part of their job.
b.	The following rules apply to all VA contractors. I agree to:
(1)	Follow established procedures for requesting, accessing, and closing user accounts and access. I will not request or obtain access beyond what is normally granted to users or by what is outlined in the contract.
(2)	Use only systems, software, databases, and data which I am authorized to use, including any copyright restrictions.
(3)	I will not use other equipment (OE) (non-contractor owned) for the storage, transfer, or processing of VA sensitive information without a VA CIO approved waiver, unless it has been reviewed and approved by local management and is included in the language of the contract. If authorized to use OE IT equipment, I must ensure that the system meets all applicable 6500 Handbook requirements for OE.
(4)	Not use my position of trust and access rights to exploit system controls or access information for any reason other than in the performance of the contract.
(5)	Not attempt to override or disable security, technical, or management controls unless expressly permitted to do so as an explicit requirement under the contract or at the direction of the COTR or ISO. If I am allowed or required to have a local administrator account on a government-owned computer, that local administrative account does not confer me unrestricted access or use, nor the authority to bypass security or other controls except as expressly permitted by the VA CIO or CIO's designee.
(6)	Contractors' use of systems, information, or sites is strictly limited to fulfill the terms of the contract. I understand no personal use is authorized. I will only use other Federal government information systems as expressly authorized by the terms of those systems. I accept that the restrictions under ethics regulations and criminal law still apply.
(7)	Grant access to systems and information only to those who have an official need to know.
(8)	Protect passwords from access by other individuals.
(9)	Create and change passwords in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 on systems and any devices protecting VA information as well as the rules of behavior and security settings for the particular system in question.
(10)	Protect information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, or destruction. I will only use encryption that is FIPS 140-2 validated to safeguard VA sensitive information, both safeguarding VA sensitive information in storage and in transit regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA.
(11)	Follow VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization to protect VA information. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders.
(12)	Ensure that the COTR has previously approved VA information for public dissemination, including e-mail communications outside of the VA as appropriate. I will not make any unauthorized disclosure of any VA sensitive information through the use of any means of communication including but not limited to e-mail, instant messaging, online chat, and web bulletin boards or logs.
(13)	Not host, set up, administer, or run an Internet server related to my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA unless explicitly authorized under the contract or in writing by the COTR.
(14)	Protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse. I will follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal government IT equipment, information, and systems. I will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the COTR.
(15)	Only use anti-virus software, antispyware, and firewall/intrusion detection software authorized by VA. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA.
(16)	Not disable or degrade the standard anti-virus software, antispyware, and/or firewall/intrusion detection software on the computer I use to access and use information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. I will report anti-virus, antispyware, firewall or intrusion detection software errors, or significant alert messages to the COTR.
(17)	Understand that restoration of service of any VA system is a concern of all users of the system.
(18)	Complete required information security and privacy training, and complete required training for the particular systems to which I require access.
3. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON- VA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES
a.	When required to complete work under the contract, I will directly connect to the VA network whenever possible. If a direct connection to the VA network is not possible, then I will use VA approved remote access software and services.
b.	Remote access to non-public VA information technology resources is prohibited from publicly-available IT computers, such as remotely connecting to the internal VA network from computers in a public library.
c.	I will not have both a VA network line and any kind of non-VA network line including a wireless network card, modem with phone line, or other network device physically connected to my computer at the same time, unless the dual connection is explicitly authorized by the COTR.
d.	I understand that I may not obviate or evade my responsibility to adhere to VA security requirements by subcontracting any work under any given contract or agreement with VA, and that any subcontractor(s) I engage shall likewise be bound by the same security requirements and penalties for violating the same.
4. STATEMENT ON LITIGATION
This User Agreement does not and should not be relied upon to create any other right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law, by a party to litigation with the United States Government.
5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE
I acknowledge receipt of this User Agreement. I understand and accept all terms and conditions of this User Agreement, and I will comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement and any additional VA warning banners, directives, handbooks, notices, or directions regarding access to or use of information systems or information. The terms and conditions of this document do not supersede the terms and conditions of the signatory's employer
