<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST</strong></p>
<p>Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) through Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkot (DABS)<br />Construction Management Services for the Installation of the Turbine Generation Unit #2 at Kajaki Dam Hydropower Plant in Helmand Province, Afghanistan</p>
<p>Project is an "On-Budget" activity being funding under a Bilateral Agreement between GIROA and the United States Government through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)</p>
<p>DABS requests Expressions of Interest from Qualified Construction Management firms for providing the services described below. DABS intends to procure Construction Management At-Risk (CM-AR) or Construction Management Agency (CM-A) services for the installation of Unit #2 at Kajaki Dam Hydropower Plant. During this project the CM-AR/CM-A firm will work closely with DABS professional staff to refine the Unit #2 installation scope of work and obtain support services including security and life support at the Kajaki site. Unit #2 components are in storage on site and will be used in the installation effort as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). GFE inventory has been condition assessed and requires less than 5% replacement prior to installation. Previously completed design information for the Unit #2 installation will also be available for use. If DABS chooses to pursue the CM-AR approach, the first phase (design completion, construction management, life support,security) services will be paid for under a cost-reimbursement/fixed fee agreement with the second phase (turbine installation and related construction) services paid for under a GMP (guaranteed maximum price) contract. If DABS chooses the CM-A approach, the selected firm will be paid under a cost-reimbursement/fixed fee agreement with the Unit #2 construction contractor being paid under a separate contract with DABS. The anticipated total budget for the project, including construction, is between US$60 and US$80 million.</p>
<p>DABS invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing these services. Interested firms must provide information indicating that they are qualified to perform CM-AR and/or CM-A services (brochures, description of similar assignments, experience in similar conditions, availability of appropriate skills among staff, and other relevant information). Firms may associate to enhance their qualifications.</p>
<p>Following an assessment of the Expression of Interest submittals, DABS will choose the CM-AR or CM-A approach and provide a Request for Proposals package to be used in the actual selection process. The CM-AR or CM-A firm will be selected in accordance with a Qualifications and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) process as per GIRoA procurement regulations with support from USAID.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest should be no more than ten (10) pages in length and must be delivered to the address below at or before 14:00 Hrs (local time) on March 30, 2013.</p>

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Currently, many business processes within the organization are dependent on paper documents that are submitted to the OCFO-NO from external sources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OCFO-NO also creates paper documents - primarily electronic documents that are printed for signature and paper reports that are generated from the mainframe business systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This dependency on physical paper has many inherent disadvantages, including limiting the OCFO-NO's ability to respond to a COOP event and limiting telework opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, it impedes opportunities to employ technology tools that could facilitate re-engineering and optimization of business processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
