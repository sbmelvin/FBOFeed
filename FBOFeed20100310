<DESC>The Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/RXM) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for the Photonics Manufacturing Program to address manufacturing challenges associated with producing militarized, high bandwidth photonics interconnect technology. This effort should help identify and leverage manufacturing improvement programs that enhance the affordability and capability of militarized photonics interconnect technology and thereby expedite technology transition to the Warfighter.
<p>Proposals should address how manufacturing improvements would be incorporated into current and future AF weapon system production programs. Proposed efforts should focus on increasing the producibility and affordability of systems with the following specific areas of interest:</p>
<p>a. Performance: Air Force systems (ground, air and space) are processing greater and greater amounts of data and information requiring increased interconnect communications bandwidths at intra-module (chip-to-chip), inter-module (board-to-board) and system (system-to-system) levels. Photonics interconnect technology can meet these increased requirements but are in need of manufacturing process improvements to make the technology more producible and thereby affordable for Air Force applications. Proposed programs should address how to meet Air Force next generation and future generation interconnect communication needs thereby accelerating technology insertion.</p>
<p>b. Scaleability: Demonstrate how the interconnect technology solution will meet chip, board and system interconnection requirements and also meet increasing bandwidth requirements of the future. Demonstrate how photonics interconnection technology solutions can accommodate migration from chip levels to system levels as well as accommodate not only present day bandwidth requirements but also future increased bandwidth requirements.</p>
<p>c. Transition: Identify anticipated technology insertions into Air Force weapon systems for the next 5 years. True insertion dates versus just transition opportunities are being sought. Weapon system office endorsements of the technology are also highly desirable.</p>
<p>Address technical questions to: Dr. Greg Cazzell, (937) 904-4599</p>

<DESC>Headquarters 754th Electronic Systems Group's (HQ 754th ELSG) Field Assistance Service (FAS) supports over 115 754th ELSG developed, acquired, and maintained Combat Support Information Systems (CSIS) and communication computer systems.  The FAS provides support on a 24 hour per day, 7 day per week, and 365 days per year basis to over 450 Department of Defense (DoD) sites around the world.  It serves as the primary interface with HQ 754th ELSG's customers and Air Force users around the world.  Around the clock professional response to user trouble calls is required to prevent adverse impacts on user missions and degraded system support to those users.  FAS personnel respond to trouble reports and calls by providing first level technical support on application software problems, hardware and operating system software problems, network and connectivity problems, and systems documentation problems.  In order to accomplish this mission, over 315,000 calls are responded to e! ach year by a joint Air Force and contractor team.
The current FAS ACD system is inadequate to meet future needs.  The Air Force is transitioning to the Vista and Windows 7 operating systems, and the current ACD is not compatible with Vista in a native environment.  We require the complete telephony solution to be Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified, and listed in the JITC Approved Products List (APL), to run properly with workstations in both a native Vista and Windows 7 environment

THISOPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (SAIC)UNDER CONTRACT NNA05BE28C FOR TECHNICAL SERVICES FOR AEROSPACE SYSTEMS MODELING ANDSIMULATION AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER (ARC), MOFFETT FIELD, CA, AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. ARC intends to issue the following Task Orders to be funded by the Recovery Act:Task Order 410, titled: Development of Future Flight Central for Safe & EfficientSurface Operations Simulations will upgrade the computational power of the Future FlightCentral (FFC) laboratory at NASA Ames in order to simulate the more complex automationrequired by Safe and Efficient Surface Operations (SESO) research.  As a result of theupgrade, researchers will be able to use the FFC to simulate future airport surfaceoperations concepts (such as algorithms to reduce taxi time or improve runway capacity)developed	   by NASA and others.	Contract modification 96 will be issued to addAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act Reporting Requirements to the contract and fullyfund Task Order 410. Task Order 510, titled: ACFS Upgrade:	Phase 3 Integration will provide a high-fidelityaerodynamics model of a commercial transport aircraft interfaced to a state-of-the-art	       Flight Management System that will allow human-in-the-loop simulation research anddevelopment of trajectory-based optimization concepts for future air traffic managementoperations.  As a result of this task, the Advanced Concepts Flight Simulator (ACFS)cockpit will include a fully integrated commercial aircraft model so that advanced humaninterface and display concepts can be tested in Next Generation Air TransportationManagement System (NextGen) environments.  A separate contract modification will beissued to fund Task Order 510. Task Order 610, titled: Support Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) Research in National AirSpace (NAS) Modeling and Simulation is for research on how modeling and simulationcapabilities can help address some of the issues involved with UAS access to the NextGen. Simulation allows researchers to generate various scenarios that can be tested withoutthe need for actual flight tests, which are expensive and time-consuming.  Simulationalso allows innovative concepts to be investigated safely and with significantly lessrisk.  The result of this research will be an enhanced simulation capability that canprovide high fidelity replication of operational procedures among UAS operators, airtraffic controllers, and pilots.  A separate contract modification will be issued to fundTask Order 610. Task Order 710, titled: Voice Communication System Upgrade for the N210 Air TrafficManagement Lab is for the installation of a voice communication system (VCS) in the AirTraffic Management (ATM) simulation lab, at Ames Research Center, which will enablesimulations to include the routine and required ground to air and ground to ground voicecommunications that are a part of current and projected future air transportationoperations.  As a result, the ATM lab will be able to simulate more complex air trafficmanagement automation.	A separate contract modification will be issued to fund TaskOrder 710. The Technical Services for Aerospace Systems Modeling and Simulation Contract NNA05BE28Cwas awarded on a competitive basis.  It would be impracticable to use a fixed pricecontract to secure technical services of the kind or quality required for thesemodifications, since the modifications are to an existing Cost Reimbursement Contract.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Grant City (Worth County) Missouri, that will be expiring.  USDA is seeking to lease approximately 2350 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2150 square feet of contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area (ABOA).  The lease term requirement is for 5 years.  The space must be available for occupancy by June 1, 2010.  The delineated area is within the city limits of Grant City, MO.

Other applicable requirements include:

	Parking -24 hard surface for customers and official Government vehicles.
	Security 

The USDA is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The USDA will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act of 2009, Pub L 111-5 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.704, Publicizing-Preaward, the Government posts this notice of intent to award a sole-source a labor-hour task order under the existing Department of State Hybrid Information Technology Services for State (HITSS) contract, in the 8(a) Set-Aside Pool to WINS, 7404 Executive Place, Suite 400, Seabrook, MD  20706.  No other companies are eligible to compete for this task order.

The Department of State (DoS) has an urgent need for technical services to review and technically assess software on the network and software proposed to be on the network to reduce vulnerabilities and increase central control of all products/licenses on the network. In this review and assessment, contractor support will use current enterprise-level technology tools (iPost, McAfee, and other IRM tools available) to monitor software on the network for identification of basic Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) applications outside the Microsoft and Oracle Enterprise Licensing Agreements (ELAs) and Standard Operating Environment (SOE). There are instances of COTS applications installed that are not IT CCB approved and do not belong on the network.  Also, many COTS applications that are widely used throughout the Department could require the establishment of other ELAs.

The rationale for using other than a fixed-price approach is that the level of effort for the required IT services depends on variables that will not be known prior to task issuance and neither the Government nor the Contractor are able to estimate the extend or duration of the work with any reasonable degree of confidence. Because of the uncertainly of the work and level of effort, a fixed price task order can not be reasonably negotiated and only a labor-hour task order can be reasonably awarded.

<a href="mailto:john.hawk@faa.gov">john.hawk@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This is a market survey for DC-3 AIRCRAFT AIRFRAME MAINTENANCE SUPPORT for one FAA owned vintage DC-3 aircraft.  The Federal Aviation Administration has a continuing requirement for complete airframe and minor on-airframe engine maintenance, off season hangar storage, and annual aircraft inspection and certifications as required by Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) for aircraft N-34 vintage aircraft, airframe maintenance excluding the engines consisting of overhaul/repair in support of aircraft operating in various locations throughout the United States and Canada.  Preventative maintenance will be performed by FAA personnel or by third party contractors.  For survey information purposes this requirement is contemplated to be a three year contract (basic with two one-year option periods) having Firm Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursable Material and Time and Material elements.   The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation, with a size standard of $7M.  
Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In addition, interested firms must meet certain technical qualifications.  Firms must demonstrate the ability to comply with Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) General Maintenance Manual, the manufacturers' specifications, recommendations, and repair instructions.  This requirement also includes a requirement that the Offeror must possess Parts Manufacture Approval (PMA) for Douglas DC-3 or Basler Turbo Conversion BT-67 aircraft.  The Offeror must provide for the facility being considered a copy of the FAA Repair Station Certificate and Operations Specifications for DC-3 Aircraft.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:	Type of services provided by your firm, with the following DC-3 ratings or limited ratings:Airframe	Limited PowerplantRadioLimited InstrumentLimited accessory(Reference SOW Paragraph 1.6 Contractor Qualifications)	Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance),	Number of years in business	FAR Part 145 information described above
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide the required services. 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 
All responses to this market survey must be received by Friday, March 19, 2010, 5:00 PM CST.   All submittals should be submitted to:

EVALUATION FACTORS
Potential Contractors shall be evaluated in terms of the factors/criteria identified below.  Submissions will be evaluated against the evaluation factors as they relate to the requirements of the solicitation, as well as evaluated for meeting mandatory responsibility criteria per FAR Subpart 9.1.  A detailed evaluation will be made of the submissions.  Submissions must demonstrate a thorough understanding of and the capability to accomplish the overall requirements as stated in the following evaluation factors. Firms will be evaluated on the following factors listed in descending order of importance: 

Evaluation Factor 1  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence 
The Board will evaluate the specialized experience on similar projects and the technical capabilities of the prime offeror and any subcontractors.  The Board will examine the effectiveness of the proposed project team to ensure the Offerors ability to coordinate the needs of several of the Governments key partners. This will include evaluating the management structure; coordination of disciplines; offices and/or subcontractors; and the prior working relationships between team members. Also to be reviewed is how successful the offeror is in integrating the needs of multiple clients/partners.  The Board will evaluate submissions to determine if a history of successful execution of designs for public administrative and recreation facilities, including Visitor Orientation and Learning facilities in environmentally sensitive settings can be demonstrated. Specifically the Board will evaluate offerors/teams experience with:  (a) Sustainable design; (b) Previous LEED-certified designs and projects; (c) Recreational design specifically addressing needs of multicultural communities; (d) Managing projects with natural resource agencies corporate cultures; (e) Designing interior/exterior spaces that effectively gather, engage and inspire people to interact and learn together; (f) Land planning of recreational day use areas and other public gathering and discovery spaces as well as Visitor Orientation and Learning facilities; (g) Producing designs for unique and sensitive environments which are integrated into the environment; and, (h) Energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.  Provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for those projects profiled under this category.  A minimum of five projects are desired and no more than ten will be reviewed. Include a representative floor plan, site plan, building section, or other appropriate drawing, and a minimum of two photographs must be included for each project.

The Board will examine and note the offerors organizational structure, approach and philosophy regarding construction management of small to medium construction projects (e.g. $100,000 to 50 million) with complex demands.  The Board will examine the offerors experience with design and/or construction management projects where community members, fundraising specialists/donors/board member, non profits, and/or diverse stakeholders had meaningful involvement in the process.  Please provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for two projects under this category.  

The Board will examine the offerors ability to produce notable and distinctive architecture while working within a design guideline framework.  Please provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for two projects under this category.  Include at least two photographs for each project.  The Board will investigate AutoCAD and design presentation software capabilities.  Responses should include software name, version and number and/or names of skilled operators on the team.  The Board will evaluate the scope of experience with the types of work and disciplines noted in the attached Statement of Work Document.

Evaluation Factor 2  Proximity Factor 
The Board shall consider the geographic proximity for coordination and communication with key Forest Service staff, and the offerors knowledge of locality.  It is expected that the majority of the work under this solicitation will be for the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA), Las Vegas.  The remaining work load may include locations throughout the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.  Consequently, a geographic location preference will be given for Las Vegas, Nevada and surrounding area (50 mile radius).  Scoring for the proximity factor will apply to office/key personnel locations for the lead architect-engineer firm and the construction management firm.  Other consultants that are part of the offerors team which would have an incidental role in meeting contract requirements (e.g., interpretative exhibit design, specialty technical experts, etc.) may be located outside of the geographic area without affecting the proximity score. 

The offeror should demonstrate knowledge of geological features (e.g. desert and mountain environments) climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique to the Las Vegas area and experience with local government organizations, regulations, laws and unique criteria associated with the construction climate in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. The offeror should demonstrate general knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are typical to National Forest locations within the remainder of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.

Evaluation Factor 3  Professional Qualifications 
The Selection Board will evaluate the education, training, registrations, professional certificates, awards, peer recognition, overall and relevant experience, and longevity of the key management and personnel with the offeror:  The Board will consider the level of education of the staff in the disciplines needed to successfully complete the work.  The Board will consider the availability of professionals with appropriate training in specialized subjects such as energy savings and energy modeling, building inspection services, new technologies and systems, environmentally sensitive design, construction techniques appropriate for the setting/locations, development of infrastructure and recreational sites, etc., as appropriate to support the development of the work of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and other National Forest locations within the Intermountain Region.  The Board will consider the offerors depth and breadth of staff with LEED (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) Accreditation as defined by the US Green Building Council.  The Board will consider the depth and disciplines on staff who are professionally registered Engineers, Architects, and Surveyors, etc. The designers or project managers in each discipline and surveyors must be registered in the state(s) services are proposed.  The Board will consider overall and relevant experience.  Relevant experience includes A-E work typical with that encountered in the Forest Service (e.g., visitor centers, interpretative and education facilities, campgrounds, play spaces, administrative offices, etc.) and A-E experience with federal land management agencies.  The Board will consider the longevity of key staff involved with the offeror and the offerors subcontractors, indicative of the stability and continuity of each offerors practice.

Evaluation Factor 4  Past Performance  
The Board will evaluate the past performance on design services and construction management on contracts of similar size and scope.  The Board will examine the documented past performance of the Offeror and Subcontractors in the Governments PPIRS site, (The Past Performance Information Retrieval System) a government database for Civilian Agencies.  The Board will evaluate the design quality, timeliness and cost controls implemented in projects of similar size (e.g. $100,000 to $50 million) and scope (described in Factor 2) in the public and/or private sector.  Provide a list of four projects with the project name, description, award price, final price, client name and contact information.  Include similar information on construction management projects.  The Board will examine the trend of repeat business with clients, which suggests strong long-term relationships. Please provide the specific project name, point of contact, phone number, email for three past clients to verify successful performance of the proposed Offeror.  The Board will compare the list of personnel involved in successful projects with the proposed team for the contract.  The availability of successful professionals with proven track records will be a key factor in the selection of a submission.

Evaluation Factor 5  Capacity to Accomplish the Work 
Provide a brief narrative regarding the size of the firms (prime and subcontractors), current workload (number of projects and dollar value), and ability to absorb additional work.  The Board will consider an offeror's experience with similar size projects and the available capacity of key disciplines when evaluating the capacity of a offeror to perform the work. The board will consider the full potential value of any current contracts that a offeror has been awarded when evaluating capacity.  The Board will evaluate evidence of the success of long term relationships between the offerors proposed team (prime and subconsultants) which suggests the ability to work together and accomplish successful projects. An exhibit illustrating past projects where the multiple firms of the offerors team have worked together should be submitted to assist the agency in understanding this element. 

Evaluation Factor 6  Oral Interview 
Oral interviews will be required in the second stage of evaluations for the short-listed firms notified by the government.  This factor is included in this synopsis for information only and is not to be included in the submissions to this synopsis posting.  Interviews will be conducted with the offerors determined to be the most qualified based on evaluation of SF-330s and Evaluation Factors 1-5.  Interviews will be conducted with a minimum of three offerors and no more than six offerors.  Interviews will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, and will last no longer than two hours.  Offerors should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation factors and demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  The key project staff from the offerors team (prime and subconsultants) should attend the interview, up to ten persons.  Emphasis will be placed on the lead designer/engineer-A/E teams understanding of the unique aspects of the SMNRA Middle Kyle Complex project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance processes.

All cut and chipped materials from Unit 246, not chipped on site will be transported to the Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon. Cut materials from other units may be used by the Forest Service for its sole use when left by the Contractor at Final Acceptance of the Project. In the remaining 60 acres, some units or portions of Units may be suitable for treatment with small Cable Yarding systems. If the Contractors proposal includes a yarding system to be used when treating these acres, including ground-based or cable yarding, these systems may be used, otherwise units will be treated solely by Hand Removal or chip-on-site Techniques.
2.)	Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, upon which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date or use it for its sole needs. Except in Units 150 and 246, the contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units or Process and Storage Areas prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit or the Process and Storage Areas.
3.)	The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
4.)	The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
5.)	Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
6.)	In Units selected by the Contractor or designated by the Forest Service to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage, Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
7.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit Prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated.

11.) Units may contain one or more dry washes or Designated Streams. In dry washes, avoid treating Riparian vegetation in and on the banks. No piling of cut vegetation is permitted in or on the banks of dry washes. The Contracting Officer will walk units with the contractor prior to work beginning in units containing dry washes or Designated Streams. Designated Streams are shown on project maps or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
12.) Riparian Vegetation does not include Conifer Species.
13.) Residential Housing or other structures are present in many of the units in this project and: H 4 -Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances are applicable to these areas.
14.)  Access Roads to units and project areas may be primitive and in need of minor repairs.

Trees paid for under Pay Item 110, require that the contractor, fall, buck to lengths 20-25 feet, and transport to a Process and Storage Area designated by the Forest Service the cut trees. The designated Process and Storage Area is near the intersection of Highways 157 and 158 behind a locked gate. These trees are the property of the Forest Service. Trees fell under Pay Item 110, are the sole property of the Forest Service. At any time prior to the contractor cutting these trees under Pay Item 110, these trees may be felled by the contractor or others with no compensation to the Contractor. Units may contain Hazardous tress with no number (often painted cut) which will require falling for safety reasons. There is no separate Pay Item for these trees and they are the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Unit or Project.
17) All Units have a Limited Operating Period (LOP) and no work within the Units can occur prior to July 1. Contractor will submit a Work Schedule which demonstrates that all work in Units and on the Project will be completed prior to November 1, 2010.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain Refrigerated Trailers as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents. We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice. The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.  A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services. This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet. Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer. A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication. Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected. The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR). Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system. Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account. The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud. The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website: http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php. 1525

<DESC>NASA/GRC has an existing contract with ARES Corp., Burlinghame, CA 94010 for thesupport and maintenance of the Process Based Mission Assurance - Knowledge ManagementSystem (PBMA-KMS).  The contract is a 5 year IDIQ contract which expires on June 15,2011.  The current maximum value is $12 million and this ceiling will be reachedimminently.  Therefore, NASA/GRC intends to increase the contract ceiling to $18 millionto allow continued use of the contract until its expiration date and to allow sufficienttime for the Center to analyze and procure its future requirements for these services.This increase in contract value will be done under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agencyrequirements".	No other company has the knowledge of the current PBMA-KMS system that ARES has acquiredover the last 9 years. To bring in a new company to service that system for the next 15months while a procurement for future requirements is conducted would cause a disruptionin current services.  The Government acquired the existing items and services as a commercial item using FARPart 12.No solicitation is required for this action.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Study and Report to: Identify Methods to Create Efficient Reimbursement Incentives to Improve Health Care Quality  and Understand the Impact of Health IT in Underserved Communities and those with Health Disparities
<SOLNBR>RFTOOS30650
<RESPDATE>040710
<CONTACT>Anne F Hunt, Phone (301) 443-5148, Email anne.hunt@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.

The purpose of this contract is to conduct two projects required under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. This statute includes The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the HITECH Act) that sets forth a plan for advancing the appropriate use of health information technology to improve quality of care and establish a foundation for health care reform. The first project (Project A) will examine methods to create efficient reimbursement incentives for improving health care quality in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health clinics (RHCs), and free clinics. Project A requires a Report to Congress by February, 2011. The second project (Project B) will investigate the impact of Health Information Technology (HIT), including electronic health records (EHR), in communities with health disparities and in areas with a high proportion of individuals who are uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved (including urban and rural areas). This project will also identify practices to increase adoption of HIT by health care providers in such communities and the use of HIT to reduce and better manage chronic diseases. 
	
The purpose of Project A under this contract is to examine methods to create efficient reimbursement incentives for improving health care quality in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health clinics (RHCs), and free clinics. This project was mandated in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (P.L. 111-5, section 13113(b)), and requires, not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of the Act, the submission of a Report to the appropriate committees of jurisdiction of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Project A will review and assess different reimbursement incentives that have been utilized in Medicare, Medicaid and by private payers and States. The study should then address whether or not these incentives can be duplicated among safety-net providers. Since the study was authorized in The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act (P.L. 111-5, Sec. 13113(b)), it should include a focus on the role of payment incentives for health information technology (HIT), including payment for telehealth services, and how these incentives can lead to improved health care.

This study will investigate the impact of Health Information Technology (HIT) including electronic health records (EHR) in communities with health disparities and in areas with a high proportion of individuals who are uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved (including urban and rural areas). The study will also identify practices to increase adoption of HIT by health care providers in such communities and the use of HIT to reduce and better manage chronic diseases. Legislative authority for this activity is found in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (P.L. 111-5, Sec. 13101, Subtitle A, Sec. 3001).

Project A:
The need to reform current health care payment methods that promote inappropriate or inefficient behaviors and that impede progress toward better quality care has been established.    The current basic payment systems reward overuse of services and use of high-cost complex procedures; it is understood that there is a wide variation in practice patterns and that these variations do not necessarily correlate with improved quality. Payment reforms are recognized as a key ingredient to promote high quality clinical, patient-centered, and efficient care.  The concept of payment that rewards higher quality has begun to be accepted by payers and to take shape in ways such as through CMS demonstration programs,  performance measures, and other private payer incentive programs. The evidence in support of various public- and private-sector programs designed to align payment incentives to promote better-quality care by rewarding providers who perform well has been reported. Current efforts to link health care payment to the quality and efficiency of care provided are shifting the reimbursement structure away from paying providers based solely on their volume of services. 
	
The current structure of reimbursement programs designed to promote quality often limit FQHC, RHC, and free clinic participation because of their unique payment methodologies.   These types of providers generally bill Medicare on an institutional claim form which does not include certain critical data elements necessary for implementing quality incentive types of programs established by CMS and other payers.  FQHC and RHC participation in previous quality incentive programs has been contingent on whether or not they elect to bill on a physician claim form and be paid according to the physician fee schedule.  Changing to this billing approach would result in eligibility to participate in the demonstration programs.	
	
The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), in coordination with  other offices in the Department, seeks to describe and assess methods to create efficient reimbursement incentives for improving health care quality in FQHCs, RHCs and free clinics, under the guidance provided in ARRA section 13113(b). 
	
Project B:
The U.S. health care system faces multiple challenges that require new approaches to protecting the health of the American people and to providing essential health care services. These challenges include rising health care costs, ongoing evidence of poor quality and outcomes, an aging population with multiple chronic conditions, an ethnic and racial diversity in health care access and outcomes, and an increasingly complex health care system.

Interoperable health information technology (HIT) includes a promising set of tools that can help address these issues by improving quality, safety and efficiency of health care. These technologies include telehealth, EHRs, and personal health records (PHRs), to enhance communication and access between patients and providers, as well as health information exchange (HIE) to facilitate appropriate sharing of health care data and coordination among health care practitioners.

The goals for the project are to: 
1. Provide a baseline understanding and assessment of reimbursement incentive programs in place or in the process of being implemented.  This assessment shall include different categories of quality incentive programs, targeted goals and outcomes, methodologies for payment, and the types of providers participating in the programs. It should discuss provider reimbursement incentive initiatives in the planning stages or under discussion and how FQHCs, RHCs, and free clinics might participate in those quality-related incentive programs.  Future reimbursement initiatives might include, for example, those under consideration in Congressional health reform legislation, initiatives under development at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or state-specific reimbursement initiatives that could be generalized across FQHCs, RHCs and free clinics.

2. Provide options for potential approaches to increase the participation of FQHCs, RHCs, and free clinics in initiatives involving efficient reimbursement for improving health care quality.

3. Define the conditions, catalysts and barriers that facilitate and hinder FQHCs, RHCs, and free clinics programs participation in quality-related reimbursement initiatives.

4. Using an expert panel and regional meetings, identify the most promising methods and successful approaches to establish quality-related reimbursement programs that include FQHCs, RHCs, and free clinics. The methods and topics reviewed by the expert panel should take into account time-sensitive issues such as health care reform, accountable care organizations, episodes of care, medical home, and meaningful use HIT incentive payments.  Topics should focus on pay for performance approaches that result in both cost reduction and quality improvement.  

5. Create a set of options demonstrating what is needed to include and sustain participation of FQHCs, RHCs, and free clinics in quality-related incentive programs including barriers, gaps and successful strategies and suggestions for future opportunities. 
	
To accomplish these goals, the Contractor will conduct an assessment of current quality incentive reimbursement programs. The assessment will examine how these programs have been structured in the past and how they have evolved over time and the extent that these incentive programs are effective at achieving the intended outcomes (e.g. improved quality, efficiency). The Contractor will conduct an environmental scan that will provide an analytic framework for the project that can be used to clarify the types and characteristics of various public- and private-sector programs designed to align payment incentives to promote better quality of care. The environmental scan will include information from published as well as unpublished resources, open-ended discussions with payer organizations such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as well as discussions with organizations representing FQHCs, RHCs and free clinics, and other resources, academia, and experts in health care financing. An important aspect of the environmental scan will be the identification of gaps, as well as recommendations for studies and approaches to fill those gaps. These identified gaps can be used to generate topics for additional research.

The environmental scan will provide information to assist in the development of a slate of topics to be further evaluated in white papers to be developed. An expert panel will be convened to help guide the study content.  The expert panel will work on identifying topics for a series of white papers based on a set of focused questions on key topic areas

A meeting of internal and external stakeholders will be held to provide input in establishing methods to create efficient reimbursement incentives for improving health care quality in FQHCs, RHCs, and free clinics.  The Contractor will follow the definitions for FQHCs, RHCs, and free clinics found in current federal guidelines.  External stakeholders should include organizations such as the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC), the National Association of Rural Health Clinics (NARHC), and the National Association of Free Clinics (NAFC).  In addition, foundations and other organizations that have offered or studied quality incentive programs will be included in these meetings. 

The study will provide an assessment of whether and how FQHCs, RHCs, and free clinics can more effectively participate in quality incentive programs and will identify methods to create new appropriate reimbursement incentives for improving health care quality for these provider types. The final product will include a synthesis report with specific and practical methods regarding ways these programs can achieve quality improvement through payment incentives.  The study will provide the Congress with information regarding innovative quality reimbursement incentives.    

Project B:
The goals for the project are to: 

1. Assess the impact of HIT and EHR in communities with health disparities and in areas with a high proportion of individuals who are uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved (including urban and rural areas); 

2. Identify practices to increase the adoption of HIT by health care providers in such communities; and

3. Identify practices to increase the use of HIT to reduce and better manage chronic diseases.


In order to accomplish these goals, the contractor shall work closely with the ONC project officer to:

Assist in the formation and convening of an interdisciplinary panel of experts in HIT, frontline healthcare delivery, health disparities and quality measurement, quality improvement and other disciplines as necessary. The expert panel shall assist with all phases of the contract, as described in the following sections.  The composition of the interdisciplinary panel shall be developed in consultation with the project officer and shall be approved by the project officer before appointments are made. The interdisciplinary panel of experts shall be no larger than 10 non-federal individuals.

Conduct an environmental scan and literature review using published and gray literature as well as interviews. The environmental scan should provide an analytic framework for the project that can be used to clarify the types and characteristics of model HIT adopters in the context of this study.  As part of the environmental scan, the contractor will identify potential sources of data supported by rigorous research and robust studies that can be used for the analysis. Specific health information technologies and tools (including, but not limited to, electronic health records, electronic registries, public health information systems, telehealth, personal health records and health information exchanges) should be included in the environmental scan to evaluate whether and how these technologies might impact health disparities.  The contractor will be required to select a reference point from which disparities can be measured; whether disparities should be measured in relative or absolute terms; the precision of the statistics used to measure disparities; the use and interpretation of summary measures of disparities; etc.

Develop and implement a study framework to examine the impact of HIT on communities with health disparities and in areas with a high proportion of individuals who are uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved (including urban and rural areas).  This assessment should provide information and recommendations regarding practices to increase the use of HIT by both patients and providers to reduce and better manage chronic diseases.

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Marat Kushkenbayevich Ormanov<br />General Director<br />JSC "National maritime shipping company "Kazmortransflot""<br />Mcrn 13, Business center 55<br />Aktau, 130000<br />Kazakhstan<br />Tel:+7 (7292) 200 890<br />Fax: +7 (7292) 200 888<br />E-mail: info@kmtf.kz</p>
<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform technical assistance to evaluate the technical, economic and financial feasibility of implementing the Electronic Documentation Procedure or Early Departure Procedure (EDP). These procedures may also be known as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or Advanced Notification systems.</p>
<p>Kazakhstani crude oil is currently shipped in limited amounts of approximately 150,000 barrels per day across the Caspian Sea from the Port of Aktau, currently the only major seaport in Kazakhstan, to Azerbaijan. Over the next 10 years however, Kazakhstan is expected to dramatically increase oil production, from its current capacity of approximately 70 million tons per year to an estimated 120 million tons per year by 2019. Most of this oil will be exported, necessitating an expansion of Kazakhstan's oil export infrastructure. The Republic of Kazakhstan (RK) has prioritized the development of KCTS (Kazakhstan Caspian Transportation System) and in particular the part of KCTS - Transcaspian project (TCP), to ensure that Kazakhstan's oil export infrastructure can accommodate rising production levels. The general overview and description of the Transcaspian project is stated in the Agreement between the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Republic of Azerbaijan on support of oil transportation from the Republic of Kazakhstan through the Caspian Sea and the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the international markets by the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan system, signed on June, 16, 2006 (Agreement). This project includes loading and discharging oil terminals on Kazakh and Azeri coastal territories of the Caspian Sea, tankers and vessels (designed for oil transportation and providing other operations within the Project), and a connection to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. Initially, the Trans Caspian System (TCS) is expected to allow Kazakhstan to deliver approximately 500,000 barrels of oil per day directly to Azerbaijan via surface shipments across the Caspian Sea for onward transmission through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, other pipelines are also allowed but beyond the frame of Agreement. This volume is expected to increase to approximately 750,000 to 1.2 million barrels per day when KCTS is fully operational. The development of EDP will increase the efficiency of Trans-Caspian shipping by reducing turnaround time for ship port calls, especially for the oil shipping trade, which represents a significant portion of KMTF's shipping volume. In addition to Aktau, the RK plans to develop the Port of Kuryk as a marine oil loading and transport terminal. Eventually, the RK believes that the majority of oil exported from Kazakhstan via the Caspian will pass through Kuryk rather than Aktau.</p>
<p>The efficient utilization of tankers will have a significant impact on the overall cost of the KCTS export route. EDP, which can stand for Early Departure Procedure or Electronic Documentation Procedure, is an internationally proved and accepted procedure that facilitates and expedites the arrival and departure clearances for a vessel and its cargo. Specifically, it allows for the electronic submission of necessary vessel and cargo information so that clearance from customs, health, and other officials can be obtained prior to the vessel arriving at the port. These systems are also known as Electronic Data Interchange or Advanced Notification systems.</p>
<p>Currently, ships must stay offshore while they bring the written documentation to the port and await approvals and/or inspections by the relevant officials. Implementation of this proposed procedure will reduce time spent on documentation processes, thereby increasing efficiency in the Port of Aktau.</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>Sources Sought for 
Recovery Act Funded - Photovoltaic Power System for 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory Research Support Facility
Introduction
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is looking for expressions of interest from qualified organizations to provide a turn-key high efficiency photovoltaic power system for the Research Support Facilities located in Golden, Colorado.  NREL is the only federal laboratory dedicated to the research, development, commercialization and deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.  Through our Sustainable NREL Program, we are committed to "walking the talk" by minimizing our use of resources (energy, materials, and water) while receiving the maximum value from resources used along with balancing environmental, economic, and human impacts.
Objective:
NREL is currently in the process of constructing the Research Support Facilities (RSF) which is a 220,000 s.f. office building (anticipated to open in the summer of 2010) which will redefine energy usage for Class A office buildings.  NREL is also in the process of designing and constructing an additional wing (RSF II) to its RSF which is expected to be a 150,000 s.f. four-story building that will house approximately 525 staff.  The energy model for the RSF II anticipates that the combined facility (including both RSF and RSF II) will require a minimum of 3,500,000 kWh of photovoltaic power production to achieve its zero energy requirement.  Currently, there is 867,000 kWh of PV power production being supplied on the roof of RSF under a separate subcontract.  Approximately 2,633,000 kWh of photovoltaic power will be needed to complete the zero energy requirement for the Research Support Facilities.  As the nations premier energy efficiency and renewable energy laboratory, NREL will require a cutting edge approach to energy efficiency for this facility to match our campus environment.  
The areas available to locate the PV are as follows:
1.	On the roof of the RSF II which is anticipated to have approximately 30,000 sf of area available.
2.	On a structure over a one acre surface parking lot (visitors lot for RSF) which is anticipated to have approximately 30,000 sf of area available.  
3.	On a structure over a new multi-level parking garage structure which is anticipated to have a minimum of 80,000 sf of area available.
4.	Additional area may be available if additional PV energy can be generated in a cost effective manner. 
It is anticipated that these locations will be ready for installation of photovoltaic power system in the summer of 2011with anticipated project completion in fall of 2011.  It is NRELs intent that the project is turn-key, and that the subcontractor will engineer, procure, construct, commission and manage the installation of a photovoltaic system providing a minimum production capability of 2,633,000 kWh.  Additionally, it is NRELs intent that the project includes providing the required support structures for PV over the surface parking lot and the parking garage.  A PV ready roof is anticipated to be available on the RSF II project for installation of a rooftop PV system.  The roof of the RSF II is sloped at 10 degree fixed tilt due south, the PV over the parking lot and garage should be fixed tilt designed to provide maximum energy output at minimum cost from available area. 
As a recipient of ARRA funding, NREL has a preliminary budget of $6,000,000.00 to allocate to this project anticipating taking advantage of potential incentives.  However, as a non-tax paying entity, NREL cannot directly benefit from the tax incentives available to commercial entities. As a result, NREL encourages all interested parties to provide creative and innovative solutions to reduce the cost of the photovoltaic system by utilizing available renewable energy tax incentives, RECs such as the Xcel Solar Rewards program (http://www.xcelenergy.com/Colorado/Residential/RenewableEnergy/Solar_Rewards/Pages/LargeProgramDetails.aspx) and financing options or alternatively, maximizing the total amount of PV that can be installed on the campus with available funds. Having an option of eventual ownership of the systems is also of interest to NREL. NREL currently has third party financed PV systems on its campus utilizing power purchase agreements (PPA).
NRELs Research Support Facilities will be a living laboratory for building and building component research, allowing the testing and evaluation of future design approaches and technologies; and will facilitate the transfer of these approaches and technologies to the marketplace.  NREL is seeking organizations with experience in providing large scale PV systems including design, installation, and financing of state of the art high efficiency photovoltaic systems that support NRELs energy goals.
We invite interested parties to submit their qualifications.  Interested parties should identify projects that they have completed in the last three years as well as their experience working with architectural and structural designers to provide input into PV support systems. Experience with large, third party financed installations should also be identified.  Please cite examples of previous work experience and include references of the owners of those projects and their contact information.  References should be provided for each project outlined.
Any organizations interested in working with NREL to provide the services described within this sources sought notification should contact the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, ATTN:  Karen Leitner, 1617 Cole Boulevard - MS 1533, Golden, CO 80401-3393. Telephone calls will not be accepted; however, submittals by e-mail are encouraged and should be sent to: Karen.Leitner@nrel.gov. A list of interested firms will be maintained and considered for receipt of a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to this notice, whether mailed hardcopy or electronically, must be received by April 8, 2010.
At this time this project is open to large and small businesses, however, this requirement may change prior to issuance of a Request for Proposal.  The NAIC code is 335311 with a size standard of 750 employees.  Offeror should note this project is funded by ARRA funding and all responses shall be fully compliant with all ARRA requirements for NREL.

This project is subject to the Buy American Act requirements which require that all material and equipment used shall be manufactured in the United States.  All material/equipment not manufactured in the United States is subject to further review for compliance with the Buy American Act requirements.
Interested parties who wish to receive a RFP should be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Registration with the CCR is mandatory prior to Subcontract award so interested parties are encouraged to begin the CCR registration process as soon as possible.  
Responding to this request identifies your organization as an interested candidate only. Your submittal is not in response to a Request for Proposals (RFP).

<DESC>Facilitated Access to the Space Environment for Technology (FAST)ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITYOPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE TECHNOLOGY MATURITY IN A MICRO-GRAVITY OR REDUCED GRAVITYENVIRONMENT1.0	INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUNDThe FAST program has been established to increase opportunities to advance the maturityof key technologies and thereby reduce the risk of adopting those technologies byproviding access to space-environment testing. The FAST program also encouragescommercial development and competition by using commercially available services whenavailable.The purpose of the FAST program is targeted toward technologies that: 	Support NASA's missions but are not yet mature enough for adoption into NASAsprograms with acceptable risk; and 	Might not otherwise be tested due to lack of funding, such as those developed byprivate companies including SBIR/STTR contractors and other small companies, universitiesor research institutions and NASA projects in early development.This Announcement solicits interest from U.S. federal, state and local governmententities, U.S. private entities (including, but not limited to, commercial firms,non-profit entities, and academic institutions), and partnerships between such entities,for the use of a parabolic aircraft as a micro-gravity or reduced-gravity testbedenvironment. Awards under this Announcement to private entities will be made using NASAsauthority to enter into Space Act Agreements and will include providing access to NASAfacilities, personnel and technical information. There will no funds provided to anyProposer in connection with awards made under this Announcement. Proposers areresponsible for financing their own activities. Awards made to NASA organizations orother public entities will be made under appropriate agreement structures.  NASA Centersproposing partnerships will be responsible for entering into appropriate agreementssupporting the proposed activities, subject to the review and concurrence of the FASTProgram Coordinator.   Selected Project Teams will be provided flight time in a micro-gravity or reduced gravityenvironment through access to parabolic aircraft flights. Each flight includesapproximately 40 parabolic trajectories and each parabolic trajectory providesapproximately 25 seconds of reduced-gravity time. Microgravity and reduced gravityconditions such as lunar gravity (.16 g) or Mars gravity (.38 g) as well as other partialgravity levels can be created. The aircraft and its payload will experience increasedgravity levels (~ 2 g) in between parabolas. It is anticipated that 15-20 experimentswill be selected from this Announcement for flights scheduled during September 2010.Proposals that are not selected under this Announcement due to limited flightopportunities may be considered for future flight opportunities.Response Date:	This announcement is open through April 19, 2010.  NASA will not issue paper copies of this Announcement. NASA reserves the right to selectfor negotiations all, some, or none of the proposals submitted in response to thisAnnouncement.

NASA will not consider proposals that do not include a domestic entity asthe lead proposer. 4.0	PROPOSAL EVALUATION AND SELECTION4.1 Evaluation and Selection Process.All proposals will be initially screened to determine their compliance to the eligibility(section 3.0), technical requirements (section 5.0) and proposal instructions (section6.0) of this Announcement. Proposals that do not comply may be declared noncompliant andrejected without further review. Proposals deemed in compliance with this Announcementwill be assessed against the evaluation criteria outlined in Section 4.2 by the SelectionRecommendation Committee. Proposers should be aware that during the evaluation and selection process, NASA mayrequest clarification of a specific point or points in a proposal. Such a request and theProposers response shall be in writing. The Selection Recommendation Committee memberswill conduct independent assessments of the proposals according to evaluation criteriaoutlined in Section 4.2. 4.2 Evaluation Criteria The evaluation factors below are of equal weighting during evaluation. 1.	Relevance and Value to NASA  The proposed effort must accomplish reduced-gravitytesting of a technology of interest and value to NASAs missions, programs or projects. 2.	Technology Readiness for Testing in a Micro-Gravity or Reduced GravityEnvironment  The proposal must demonstrate that the technology is appropriate for theavailable parabolic testbed and that the proposed testing will advance its TechnologyReadiness Level (see Appendix A). There must be a reasonable expectation that thereduced-gravity testing will significantly contribute to advancing the maturity of thetechnology. Highest priority will be placed on an approach or concept that will createsubstantial increases in the current state-of-the-art. The proposal must clearlydemonstrate that the technology is ready for flight-testing.3.	Resources and Schedule  The overall merit, rationale, feasibility, andsuitability of the proposed effort or concept for testing in a micro-gravity or reducedgravity environment in light of available resources and schedule. Proposers shouldrequest the minimum number of flight days, aircraft volume and number of on-boardparticipants required to meet the proposal objectives. The FAST program would like toaccommodate as many projects as possible and so the extent of requested flight time,volume, personnel or other special needs may be a factor in the selection process. 4.	Strength of Project Team  The brief resumes of the project leader and key teammembers should indicate knowledge of the subject technology area and familiarity with thetest hardware and planned test operations. Previous experience among team members inflight-testing or other space-environment testing is not mandatory but is desirable.4.3 Selection Factors As described in Section 4.1, the results of the proposal evaluations based on thecriteria above and the subsequent Selection Recommendation Committee deliberations willbe considered in the selection process. The Selection Recommendation Committee may takeinto account a variety of programmatic factors in deciding whether or not to select anyproposals, including, but not limited to, available resources and alignment with NASAtechnology needs. All eligible proposals, regardless of source, will be evaluatedtogether and ranked for selection. The Selection Authority shall be the Director of theInnovative Partnerships Program. The Selection Authority will make the final selection ofthose approved for this opportunity after the completion of negotiations, depending onthe outcome of the negotiations. 4.4 Selection Notification NASA will notify all proposers of the results of the evaluation and selection process.After the completion of the evaluation and selection process, NASA will begin discussionswith the selected proposer(s). The purpose of the negotiations is to finalize the termsand conditions of any Agreement. All work will commence after the parties execute theSpace Act Agreement or other agreement, as applicable.5.0	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTSTechnologies selected for reduced-gravity environment testing aboard the parabolicaircraft flights must meet equipment design and other requirements as provided in theJSC Reduced Gravity Program Users Guide and Experiment Design Requirements andGuidelines which can be found at:http://jsc-aircraft-ops.jsc.nasa.gov/Reduced_Gravity/guides.html       .  All projects selected for parabolic flights must submit information for technical andsafety reviews including a Test Equipment Data Package.  Project teams must also submitspecified information on proposed participants. All participants must attend a safetybriefing at the flight facility and flight participants must complete PhysiologicalTraining in advance of the flight week. All participants must comply with safetyrequirements on the aircraft and in ground facilities and must follow all directionsgiven by NASA staff and aircraft crewmembers. All participants must behave in aprofessional manner and must not interfere in the research activities of others. Failureby participants to submit required information, obtain training by required deadlines, orengage in appropriate behavior will render a Project Team ineligible to participate inscheduled flights. Participants include all researchers, test subjects, support personneland any others associated with the Project Team who are present at the airfield facility.Parabolic flight activities will be conducted at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. NASAcannot guarantee the ultimate schedule or availability of the parabolic flights. Ifflights are cancelled due to weather or mechanical problems, reasonable efforts will bemade to reschedule those flights.  Project Teams remain responsible for all costsassociated with rescheduled or cancelled flight opportunities. Project Teams shouldprovide margin in their travel budgets to account for an unlikely but possible change inflight location or postponement of a flight week.  A flight week typically includes a test readiness review on the first day (Monday) andone flight per day for four days (Tuesday through Friday). Project Teams can request one,two, three or four flight days in their proposal. The aircraft will allow for relativelylarge equipment and can accommodate several test personnel for each project, if required. A space experiment support system called FASTRACK, developed by NASA Kennedy Space Center(KSC) and Space Florida may be available to support proposed investigations. FASTRACKprovides a rack structure and standard mid-deck locker accommodations with demonstratedinterface compatibility aboard the reduced gravity aircraft. Proposers who wish toconsider use of this capability should contact Alexis Hongamen of the KSC IPP Office at321-867-3107 (email Alexis.Hongamen-1@nasa.gov).Proposers should anticipate that multiple Project Teams will occupy the aircraft cabinand pre-flight preparation areas on the ground at the same time and the aircraft will becarrying multiple projects.  Aircraft operations personnel will participate in loading,securing and unloading project hardware. In accordance with NASAs mission to providefor the widest practicable dissemination of information, video recording and photographyof FAST program activities will be conducted by NASA. It is likely that aircraftpersonnel and other project teams will engage in similar recording activities on-boardthe aircraft and in preparation areas. These photographs and video recordings will beposted on public websites and in other publications. Project teams are responsible forensuring the protection of any proprietary aspects of their technology. For all selectedproposals, NASA will publish information regarding the selected Project Team, includingthe abstract provided in the proposal, and may use photographs and video recordings ofrelated flight test activity in public briefings and publications. Reporting RequirementsAll Project Teams are required to deliver reports as described below. All reports mustinclude a separate publicly releasable summary of the Project Teams activities under theFAST program. Failure to provide required reports will disqualify the Project Team fromparticipation in any future FAST program activities.1. Preliminary Report (1 page, not including photographs or video): A brief summary ofthe test activity prepared immediately after the flight. Photographs and video recordingsare also desired, if available. Due: No more than five business days after the finalflight day.2. Final Report (5-20 pages, not including photographs or video): A full description oftest activity and results including an assessment of the technology readiness levelbefore and after reduced-gravity testing, any lessons learned or other observations andconsiderations for further development.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND: The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is conducting a follow-up study to the clinical trial titled "The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) - Memory in Diabetes (MIND)". The follow-up study will be a two-year effort to follow-up the original ACCORD-MIND subset of patients to acquire a third Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of the brain. ACCORD-MIND MRI is a sub-study in ACCORD, a randomized, multi-center, factorial designed clinical trial in 10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MIND MRI included 620 of these participants, and was conducted at four sites, and was managed through a central coordinating office and four clinical networks. The Coordinating Center includes a central MRI quality control and reading center. The goal of the ACCORD-MIND trial was to address the question as to whether three complimentary treatment strategies could reduce the risk for cognitive decline, or adverse changes in brain structure measured on MRI. The treatment strategies administered as a part of the main ACCORD trial were designed to compare standard vs intensive control glycemia targeted to near-normal levels (target HbA1c &lt; 6), to compare to placebo the effect of fibrates, which increase HDL-cholesterol and lower triglycerides, in the context of good LDL-C control, and of intensive BP control targeting the normal range (SBP&lt; 120 mmHg). Specifically, ACCORD-MIND evaluates intensive glucose, blood pressure and lipid management as means to reduce detrimental changes in the brain structure and function.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: This contract will follow up MIND participants to acquire an additional measure of brain structure, and to expand the outcomes of the study to nursing home placement and to new clinical events that follow or precede measures of the brain. The objective of following up MIND participants is to further delineate how diabetes affects the brain. The aging of the cohort, longer follow-up and an additional MRI allow the study of the longitudinal effects of diabetes-related factors on the brain, and to investigate how these factors, in combination with older age, interact leading to worse outcomes. Specifically: the contract will investigate: 1) What changes and what is the trajectory of change in brain structure? 2) What are the risk factors associated with increased, as well as reduced risk for adverse changes in brain structure or function? 3) Do these changes increase the risk for dementia, nursing home placement or death? 4) How do the brain changes co-vary with the development of other diabetes co-morbidities such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy? and, 5) Do the changes predict prospectively collected data on fasting levels of glucose, A1C levels, and hypoglycemic events?</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall have overall responsibility for the coordination of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) activities that are a fundamental part of the ACCORD MIND Follow-Up Study. These activities include: 1) Recruitment of participants who previously participated in the ACCORD MIND sub-study. Recruitment muse be done in concert with the staff at the ACCORD clinics that are following the participants as part of the ACCORD Follow-up Study (NHLBI); 2) Acquisition, quality control, analysis, archiving, and retrieving of scans; 3) Updating and reviewing web-based activities; writing annual reports as required by the funding agency; 4) Deposition of data into a centralized database that houses other data from the ACCORD MIND MRI sub-study; 5) Analysis and collaboration on manuscripts based on this study and the previous ACCORD MIND MRI sub-study; 6) Monitor the progress of MRI field site activities, including: recruitment goals, successful scheduling for MRI appointments, completion of scan protocol, transmission of the scans to the Coordinating Center and adherence of quality control and reporting techniques; training and re-training of MRI staff as needed. Training of MRI technicians for the brain MRI should include the MRI scan protocol, scheduling and screening for participant MRI eligibility; quality control and transmission protocols; 7) Organize and implement training of staff at the local clinic that is following the MIND participants as a part of the larger main trial. Training should include: the purpose of the MRI, the logistics of identifying eligible participants, scheduling and rescheduling of appointments, and the process for addressing other issues that may routinely arise from participant questions or reasons for refusal; 8) Design and implement a Quality Control (QC) procedure for the MRI field sites that is appropriate for the four networks that have previously participated in the ACCORD MIND MRI sub-study; 9) Demonstrate comparability between the acquisition and analysis of MRI scans to the previously acquired and analyzed scans that are part of the ACCORD MIND MRI sub-study. Additionally, the Contractor shall collaborate with the MRI Study Data Coordinating Center (DCC) (MRI CC - Nick Bryan, Univ Pennsylvania) to design and maintain: 1) a web link with the main study; 2) a procedure to identify and track participants eligible for the MRI study; 3) a statistically appropriate method to generate quality control statistics; 4) production of quality control reports and uploading to web-site; 5) statistical analyses for primary publications.</p>
<p>REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: Monthly Technical Progress Report, Annual Technical Progress Report, and Final Report.</p>

<CONTACT>POINT OF CONTACT: Brooke Pyne, NSWC Technology Office, e-mail Crane_TEO@navy.mil, 812-854-4823.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts Research and Development (R&D) directed toward Strategic Missions, Special Missions and Electronic Warfare/Information Ops in support of our nation's warfighters.  The Strategic Missions area encompasses the full range of DoD activities that alter an adversary's will and ability to attack the United States and it interests, the area's primary technical areas include Threat Detection, Integrated Missile Defense and Global Strike.  The Electronic Warfare/Information Ops area supports any military action using electromagnetic energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or attack an adversary; this area's main focus includes Electronic Attack, Electronic Warfare Support and Electronic Protection.  The Special Missions area supports military forces engaged in Special Operations, Irregular Warfare and Riverine Operations, this area's primary technical areas include sensors & communications, mobility & maneuverability, special munitions & weapons, and training.  Our mission is to provide Acquisition, Fleet Support, Acquisition Engineering, R&D, Product Engineering, Systems Engineering, Test & Evaluation, Logistics, Maintenance & Repair, Legacy Systems/Products, and Program Management.  Within these mission areas the Division is responsible for the full spectrum of R&D, acquisition, and fleet support.  Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational systems.  NSWC Crane is interested in receiving proposals for R&D in all of its mission areas.  This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of three years from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia comprising such concerns.  NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCUs/MIs).  However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for HBCUs/MIs.  The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals.  Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) funded between $10,000 to $5,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area; (4) NSWC Crane is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC Crane seeks proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding.  In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper").  This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) (see attached APPENDIX 6, TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVELS AND THEIR DEFINITIONS an anticipated TRL if project is funded, and a rough cost estimate.  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically.  A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper.  The Government reserves the right to request a proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers.  Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising.  The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.  White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC Crane's specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC Crane programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC Crane with unrestricted (at least Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader o! r other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism/reasonableness of the proposed costs and the availability of funds.  These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price.  Based on evaluation of the white papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC Crane using the above noted evaluation criteria.  An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.  For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions.  This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement!  and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award."  If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.  Any commercial firm or institution of higher education may submit a proposal.  There is no longer a requirement that the entity be U.S. in origin.  White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  There is no set date for submission.  The following e-mail point of contact is provided for information regarding technical programs/technologies of interest within the warfare areas supported by NSWC Crane and for submission of white papers and proposals: Brooke Pyne (e-mail Crane_TEO@navy.mil).  Please refer to BAA number N00164-10-R-0001 in all correspondence and communications.

<SUBJECT>Statements of Qualifications for 2010 Omnibus Household Survey
<SOLNBR>DTOS59-10-R-00307
<RESPDATE>040910
<ARCHDATE>05012010
<CONTACT>James H Mowery III, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-366-4959, Email james.mowery@dot.gov
<DESC>TYPE OF NOTICE:  This notice is NOT a Solicitation or RFP.  This is a Sources-Sought Special Notice calling for the submission of a Statement of Qualifications----NOT an actual proposal---- by each and every 8(a) company POTENTIALLY interested in performing the 2010 Omnibus Household Survey project described in the four files posted herewith.  That Survey would be performed for the U. S. Department of Transportations Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA).  This Notice does NOT commit the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to making any contract award.

SCOPE OF CONSIDERATION:  At this juncture, the Contracting Officer is seeking responses ONLY from companies that have been CERTIFIED as an 8(a) firm by the U. S. Small Business Administration, and that are STILL within the calendar-time-period of their 8(a) tenure, as specified in the SBA-letterhead letter that placed them in the 8(a) program.   Moreover,  it probably would not be productive for any 8(a) firm that is currently within four months of GRADUATING from the 8(a) program to respond to this Notice, because any such firm may have graduated from the 8(a) program by the time the contracting officer is able to issue a competitive Solicitation or send a sole-source 8(a) Offering Letter to the SBA for this project.

INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR:  The incumbent contractor is MacroSys Research and Technology, located at Suite 312, 888  17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. 20006.  MacroSys was the contractor for RITAs 2009 Omnibus Household Survey.  RITA could legally award the 2010 Omnibus Household Survey to MacroSys in the form of a Task Order to be issued without competition under MacroSys ongoing IDIQ umbrella contract numbered DTOS59-09-D-00462.  However, MacroSys does not have the capacity to perform all task functions of the 2010 Omnibus Household Survey without subcontracting support, and it is believed that MacroSys would especially need subcontracting support in the data collection phase of that Survey, which accounts for more than  71% of the staff hours and cost.  RITA therefore is hoping to be able to award the data collection phase, and possibly the entire 2010 Omnibus Household Survey, to another 8(a) firm whose technical focus and data collection capabilities align more closely with the requirements of the project.  Although DOT cannot and does not promise the following outcome, there is a POSSIBILITY that a particularly impressive response to this Notice MIGHT result in DOTs awarding a SOLE-SOURCE 8(a) contract to some firm other than (or in addition to) MacroSys, for the performance of some of, or possibly all of, the 2010 Omnibus Household Survey.

DETAILS ARE IN FOUR FILES:  Potentially interested firms should open, should study, and, in preparing their Statements of Qualifications, should use, the following four separate attached files:  a file named Statement of Work for Responders; a file named SOW Attachment for Responders; a file named Instructions for Responders 2010 Omnibus Household Survey; and a file named Estimated Labor Hours for Responders.  Each Statement of Qualifications submitted should conform to the guidelines given in those four files. 
 
PAGE-LIMIT ON RESPONSES:  There is no page-limit on Statements of Qualifications submitted in response to this notice.

LOGISTICS FOR SUBMITTAL OF RESPONSES:  One complete hard-paper ORIGINAL and four complete hard-paper COPIES of each Statement of Qualifications must be RECEIVED by the contracting officer (James Mowery) not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Time April 9, 2010, at the following address:  James H.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess technologies that might permit outside intervention by rescue forces or "good Samaritans" in maritime mass-rescue incidents, including rescue or retrieval of persons from passenger vessels, hazardous predicaments in/or adjacent to water, or rescue of multiple persons in the water or from other hazardous maritime predicaments. As the primary agency for maritime Search and Rescue in the United States, the Coast Guard endeavors to minimize the loss of life and injury by rendering aid to persons in distress in the maritime environment. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. <br /><br />
<p>The Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC) is conducting research to identify both operational and state-of-the art technologies and associated equipment applicable to maritime mass rescue. "Operational" in this context refers to existing technologies and equipment that are currently used in commercial and/or Government application, while "state-of-the art" in this context refers to proven and near-proven technologies that are expected to be available in the commercial and/or Government lifesaving, rescue and assistance market in the next 30 to 36 months.</p>
<p>The RDC intends to use the information collected from this RFI to conduct detailed systems analysis that quantifies and evaluates technology readiness and applicability, device or equipment capability, and acquisition and life-cycle operating costs. <br /><br />You are invited to respond with information to assist the RDC with its market research to identify potential sources of rescue technologies and associated equipment applicable to maritime mass rescue appropriate for use on, or deployment from Coast Guard/Government vessels or commercial vessels, 25 ft (7.6M) and larger, or capable of being deployed from fixed or rotary-wing aircraft operating in the worldwide maritime environment. Information on devices that rely on inflation, as well as those that rely on rigid structural elements (including fixed framing, foam flotation, or rigid shell) is also invited.</p>
<p>RESCUE TECHNOLOGY AREAS OF INTEREST<br />I. Rescue of multiple persons in the water<br />II. Rescue of large numbers of persons from a vessel that has sustained a significant casualty<br />III. Rescue of multiple persons from hazardous maritime predicaments<br />IV. Ability to provide multiple persons temporary refuge from the water<br />V. Ability to provide a platform for safe hoisting of a large number of persons simultaneously from the water, to working deck levels associated with high-freeboard cargo vessels, passenger vessels, and large combatant vessels (or ability to be raised by medium-lift helicopter).<br /><br />SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />The following information, or best available estimate, is requested for each proposed solution. If multiple solutions are presented by the same entity, the information should be specific to each solution. <br />A. Equipment characteristics; <br />B. Equipment specifications;<br />C. Equipment capabilities/capacities; <br />D. Equipment Reliability; <br />E. Acquisition Cost;<br />F. Service Life;<br />G. Life Cycle Cost Parameters, Mean time between overhaul (MTBO), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Planned Maintenance, training;<br />H.

<DESC>Veteran's Benefit Administration - Telephone System Upgrade and Telecommunication Expansion Project Sources Sought LetterTHIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT MAY FOLLOW.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO ANY FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT.The United States Government, Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA), seeks sources for the VBA's National Telephone Strategy, which defines a consistent approach to replacing telephone systems and components with advanced equipment meeting stringent VBA functional and technical requirements.  This approach ensures that the telephone system investments made by VBA are consistent in the technology, functionality, and capabilities that meet VBA corporate business goals, as well as technical and interoperability standards.  This procurement will purchase replacement software and servers for two VBA sites supporting the Eastern Area National Call Center.  The components will be acquired from an authorized Tadiran telephone system equipment partner to ensure that VBA's business needs and interoperability requirements are met; and, to ensure that the purchase does not adversely impact VBA's existing maintenance contract with Tadiran. Purchasing equipment from unauthorized partners could increase interoperability concerns and would cause Tadiran to void the existing VBA contracts.  For this effort, VBA requires equipment from an authorized partner to ensure that the equipment will work in VBA's environment. Place of Performance:  Work will take place in:VARO Philadelphia, PA - 5000 Wissahickon Avenue, Philadelphia, PA  19144VARO Cleveland, OH - 1240 East 9th Street, Cleveland, OH  44199Also, VBA is seeking sources to expand the existing Tadiran brand Private Branch Exchange (PBX) telephone system that will be used to support the consolidation of the Tucson, Arizona out-based facility. The equipment will utilize the technology Q-Interface Signaling Protocol (QSIG and SIP) that is already in place by extending the services from the Veterans Affairs Regional Office (VARO) Phoenix, Arizona to the Tucson office using a point-to-point circuit provided by the local exchange carrier (LEC). This procurement will allow the Tucson office to utilize voicemail, outbound and inbound dialing, and provide Management Information System (MIS) information on phone usage. Place of Performance:  Work will take place in:VARO Phoenix - 3333 Central Avenue Phoenix, AZ 85012Tucson Out-Based Facility - 1360 W.

The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for LR2000 Records Improvement in Colorado.  The BPA being utilized is L10PA00578, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   The BPA was competed amongst GSA contract holders and Premier Data Services proved to provide the best value to the government.  This opportunity is only available to the current BPA contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required.
The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  The Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) is the digital portrayal of the PLSS and is assembled in a series of working ascii files and a geo-database for publication.  LR2000 is a database of the title information contained on Master Title Plats (MTP).  In order to support these initiatives, BLM will examine existing and published data sets with greater scrutiny and update GCDB and the published data sets as necessary.
This task will merge GCDB data with LR2000 to create a digital status map that can be compared to Master Title Plats to identify errors in all three data sets.  Inspection and comparison of data sets will be on renewable energy townships around the entire state of Colorado.  There are 1420 townships identified as having potential renewable energy use.  
Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc. W91278-09-C-0020  Tennessee Tombigbee Operations and Maintenance Contract<br><br>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Alabama and Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561210 applies to this contract award.   The contractor will: Make emergency repairs to the existing air conditioning system and Install a new Heating and Air Conditioning system at the Waterway Management Center in Columbus, Mississippi. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated.  This existing contract must be used because:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to removal of old unit.  2) This contract enables work to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facility is without Heating and Air Conditioning thus minimizing the impact on the staff and the visiting public.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure a subscription renewal for the Federal Retirement Benefits (FRB) Web-Integrated Solution. This proposed procurement is for services/supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis to: Economics Systems, Inc. (EconSys), 3141 Fairview Park Dr., Falls Church, VA 22042
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>1.) The United Coast Guard (USCG) will be purchasing a subscription renewal for the Federal Retirement Benefits (FRB) Web-Integrated Solution.</p>
<p>2.) This is a follow-on acquisition. The reason for the non-competitive acquisition was that the information in the central database is saved indefinitely, and is always available when we need to provide updated annuity estimates. This prevents the service and salary history from having to be re-entered.</p>
<p>3.) The service history and appropriate data automatically flows to the retirement forms to pre-populate the retirement application. The tool provides calculations for the Federal Employees Retirement Coverage and Corrections Act (FERCCA) cases. EconSys was selected by OPM to develop the correct retirement coverage errors.</p>
<p>Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

<p><br />Requirement</p>
<p>Bagram Regional Contracting Center (BRCC) has a requirement for highly qualified civilian contractor subject matter experts (SME). These SMEs would work within the contraints of the Task Force Protector deployed operational environment and work side-by-side with Military personnel supporting them within the area of their expertise. The duties described henceforth are not limited to within the S6 office, as support may at times be required within other Staff Sections within the Task Force Protector organization, and potentially at other location within the CJOA, although the primary work location shall be located at Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan.</p>
<p><br />Additional Information</p>
<p>The anticipated contract type is Firm-Fixed Price. The resultant contract for this acquisition will be for a basic period of twelve (12) months and four (4) one-year option periods with a planned start date of 1 May 2010.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services Proposals will be ranked from lowest priced to highest priced and then the technical evaluation team will review the technical acceptability of the lowest priced proposal. If the lowest priced proposal is also technically acceptable, then the contract will be awarded to that company without evaluating any remaining proposals. If the lowest priced proposal is not technically acceptable, then the next lowest priced proposal will be evaluated. This process will continue until a total of two (2) lowest priced technically acceptable offers are ascertained (the lowest price one for award, and the next one for contingency). Only the lowest price technically acceptable proposal will receive the contract award. If that company is unable/unwilling to perform under the contract, or is terminated for convenience due to a protest, then the second lowest priced technically proposal will be given the award. <br />This requirement is solicited under FAR Part 12 utilizing commercial acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The solicitation MUST be downloaded from Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at www.fbo.gov. Do not request via fax, e-mail or postal mail. No paper copies will be issued.

<p>52.232-18 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)<br />Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the February 2010 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-38. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and no additional written solicitation WILL be issued. <br />
<p>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Relais International Inc., Ottawa, Canada for the purchase and software support of new seven (7) custom build scanners, the Fujitsu Fi-6750s. Relais International Inc. customizes these scanners by removing the feeders and also by integrating them with the Relais software. These new scanners use a USB connection, rather than the SCSI connection which streamlines set-up and maintenance.</p>
<p>In 1996, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) purchased the Relais Enterprise system to automate the processing and handling of DOCLINE requests which reach NLM for distribution to the Collection Access Section and the History of Medicine Division. Additionally, the system is used to automate the processing, sorting, and accounting of requests submitted by NLM's patrons using the Overnight Photocopy Service.</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine has a requirement for an automated system that can accept orders from multiple external sources in different formats. The system must identify the requestor, sort documents according to their library location, redirect orders to alternate holdings when items are unavailable, manage exception handling for problem orders, convert documents to the format the client requested (e.g. fax, digital, paper), transmit the document to the client via the requested method (e.g. email, Ariel, fax), determine billing amounts, and it must know where the order is in the system at all times. Benefits of the system must include reductions in labor requirements and reduced cycle times for fulfilling Inter-Library Loan (ILL). NLM requires that the system be MS Windows compliant and network-based. The system must use Oracle for its database. The system must operate with scanners capable of reproducing journal articles at the rate of 21 pages per minute. Only Relais International's Relais Enterprise system carries the unique capabilities which fit the above stated requirements of the National Library of Medicine.</p>
<p>No other product on the market that has been developed for automating library services provides the capabilities of this system or is suitable for this environment. Relais Enterprise is a proprietary product of Relais International, Inc. Since Relais International, Inc. is the sole owner of Relais Enterprise, NLM has determined that Relais International, Inc. is the only source with the previous experience and expertise capable of providing the necessary technical support and system upgrades.</p>
<p>The Collection Access Section receives approximately 280,000 interlibrary loan requests and approximately 4,000 Overnight Photocopy requests annually. The requests are processed and distributed through the Relais Enterprise system. During the year we need technical support from Relais International, Inc., to ensure proper functioning of the scanners. In addition, NLM will receive software upgrades for Relais Enterprise free of charge.</p>
<p>All proposals received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM. NLM Synopsis No. NLM-10-097-UHP. EMAILS AND FACSIMILES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the products and services required by NLM. The offeror shall include all information necessary to document and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation. All responses from responsible sources will be considered. Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 105, MSC 5488, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Contracting Officer, on (301) 496-6127. Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR): htm://www.amet.gov/far/. The following clauses and provisions shall apply to this acquisition and maybe obtained from the web site: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (June 2008); FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (January 1999); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (August 2009); FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items) (March 2009); and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (September 2009).</p>

2)  STATEMENT OF WORK
The National Park Service has a requirement for 30 geo-membrane liner material panels to be delivered to Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, 5 Avenue B, Fort Smith, MT 59035.  The panels will be used as secondary containment under concrete pads that support solid waste dumpsters. These dumpsters are located adjacent to housing areas, campgrounds, boat launching ramps, and maintenance support facilities.  Potential waste from dumpster leakage could include sulfuric acid from discarded batteries, household lawn and garden pesticides, chlorine bleach, acidic and base fertilizers, motor oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, calcium and sodium chloride, oil or water based paints, thinner, and other various materials subject to uncontrolled public disposal.  Each panel will be installed in the ground under the concrete and will not be exposed to sunlight.  The air temperature ranges from -40 to +110 Fahrenheit, which subjects the installation to soil movement.  Each panel will be installed without any openings or field penetrations.  The panels will be configured in a rectangular shape with each of the four corners gathered and folded up 90 degrees to the top of the concrete pad and supported by backfill.Any award resulting from this solicitation will be a Firm-Fixed-Price type contract.

<DESC><p>This notice seeks information on potential sources for a contemplated, firm-fixed-price contract in support of the 46th Test Group (46TG) effort to assess Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) missile damage on large aircraft engines. The purpose of this planned contract involves predicting MANPADS damage effects on rotating General Electric (GE) manufactured CF6-50 engines. Tasks include consulting with the 46TG concerning the CF6-50 engine as it relates to MANPADS testing, verifying that the two CF6-50 test engines (owned by the 46TG and located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) are correctly configured for test operation, providing expertise for selection of a shotline, and generating LS-DYNA predictions of MANPADS damage with and without warhead detonation with the given shotline. Damage predictions must be delivered to the 46TG by 15 December 2010 and a detailed technical report concerning the predictions is due by 15 March 2011. The Government will provide the SA-7 MANPADS Missile Model as Government Furnished Property.<br />In addition to the technical challenges of this planned contract, proprietary data is involved for which the Government has only limited rights. Therefore, the Government does not have a technical data package it can provide potential offerors relative to the CF6-50 aircraft engine or the CF6-50 engine model (LS-DYNA). <br />This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Participation is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712, with a small business standard size of 500 employees. Interested and capable sources are encouraged to respond to this synopsis with a Statement of Capability detailing similar efforts, evidence of the ability to obtain proprietary data from General Electric, and an explanation of your ability to perform the above tasks. In addition to a Statement of Capabilities, firms responding to this announcement should include company name, CAGE code, point of contact, address, and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business. Please limit your Statement of Capability to no more than 10 pages. If e-mailing your Statement of Capability, please send it in a PDF or MS Word format. Responses should be submitted to Colin McCranie, Contract Specialist, by e-mail no later than 15 March 2010 at colin.mccranie@eglin.af.mil or by facsimile to (850) 882-4651.</p>

Recovery Act Funded - Photovoltaic Power System for 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory Research Support Facility
Introduction
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is looking for expressions of interest from qualified organizations to provide a turn-key high efficiency photovoltaic power system for the Research Support Facilities located in Golden, Colorado.  NREL is the only federal laboratory dedicated to the research, development, commercialization and deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.  Through our Sustainable NREL Program, we are committed to "walking the talk" by minimizing our use of resources (energy, materials, and water) while receiving the maximum value from resources used along with balancing environmental, economic, and human impacts.
Objective:
NREL is currently in the process of constructing the Research Support Facilities (RSF) which is a 220,000 s.f. office building (anticipated to open in the summer of 2010) which will redefine energy usage for Class A office buildings.  NREL is also in the process of designing and constructing an additional wing (RSF II) to its RSF which is expected to be a 150,000 s.f. four-story building that will house approximately 525 staff.  The energy model for the RSF II anticipates that the combined facility (including both RSF and RSF II) will require a minimum of 3,500,000 kWh of photovoltaic power production to achieve its zero energy requirement.  Currently, there is 867,000 kWh of PV power production being supplied on the roof of RSF under a separate subcontract.  Approximately 2,633,000 kWh of photovoltaic power will be needed to complete the zero energy requirement for the Research Support Facilities.  As the nations premier energy efficiency and renewable energy laboratory, NREL will require a cutting edge approach to energy efficiency for this facility to match our campus environment.  
The areas available to locate the PV are as follows:
1.	On the roof of the RSF II which is anticipated to have approximately 30,000 sf of area available.
2.	On a structure over a one acre surface parking lot (visitors lot for RSF) which is anticipated to have approximately 30,000 sf of area available.  
3.	On a structure over a new multi-level parking garage structure which is anticipated to have a minimum of 80,000 sf of area available.
4.	Additional area may be available if additional PV energy can be generated in a cost effective manner. 
It is anticipated that these locations will be ready for installation of photovoltaic power system in the summer of 2011with anticipated project completion in fall of 2011.  It is NRELs intent that the project is turn-key, and that the subcontractor will engineer, procure, construct, commission and manage the installation of a photovoltaic system providing a minimum production capability of 2,633,000 kWh.  Additionally, it is NRELs intent that the project includes providing the required support structures for PV over the surface parking lot and the parking garage.  A PV ready roof is anticipated to be available on the RSF II project for installation of a rooftop PV system.  The roof of the RSF II is sloped at 10 degree fixed tilt due south, the PV over the parking lot and garage should be fixed tilt designed to provide maximum energy output at minimum cost from available area. 
As a recipient of ARRA funding, NREL has a preliminary budget of $6,000,000.00 to allocate to this project anticipating taking advantage of potential incentives.  However, as a non-tax paying entity, NREL cannot directly benefit from the tax incentives available to commercial entities. As a result, NREL encourages all interested parties to provide creative and innovative solutions to reduce the cost of the photovoltaic system by utilizing available renewable energy tax incentives, RECs such as the Xcel Solar Rewards program (http://www.xcelenergy.com/Colorado/Residential/RenewableEnergy/Solar_Rewards/Pages/LargeProgramDetails.aspx) and financing options or alternatively, maximizing the total amount of PV that can be installed on the campus with available funds. Having an option of eventual ownership of the systems is also of interest to NREL. NREL currently has third party financed PV systems on its campus utilizing power purchase agreements (PPA).
NRELs Research Support Facilities will be a living laboratory for building and building component research, allowing the testing and evaluation of future design approaches and technologies; and will facilitate the transfer of these approaches and technologies to the marketplace.  NREL is seeking organizations with experience in providing large scale PV systems including design, installation, and financing of state of the art high efficiency photovoltaic systems that support NRELs energy goals.
We invite interested parties to submit their qualifications.  Interested parties should identify projects that they have completed in the last three years as well as their experience working with architectural and structural designers to provide input into PV support systems. Experience with large, third party financed installations should also be identified.  Please cite examples of previous work experience and include references of the owners of those projects and their contact information.  References should be provided for each project outlined.
Any organizations interested in working with NREL to provide the services described within this sources sought notification should contact the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, ATTN:  Karen Leitner, 1617 Cole Boulevard - MS 1533, Golden, CO 80401-3393. Telephone calls will not be accepted; however, submittals by e-mail are encouraged and should be sent to: Karen.Leitner@nrel.gov. A list of interested firms will be maintained and considered for receipt of a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to this notice, whether mailed hardcopy or electronically, must be received by April 12, 2010.
At this time this project is open to large and small businesses, however, this requirement may change prior to issuance of a Request for Proposal.  The NAIC code is 335311 with a size standard of 750 employees.  Offeror should note this project is funded by ARRA funding and all responses shall be fully compliant with all ARRA requirements for NREL.

This project is subject to the Buy American Act requirements which require that all material and equipment used shall be manufactured in the United States.  All material/equipment not manufactured in the United States is subject to further review for compliance with the Buy American Act requirements.
Interested parties who wish to receive a RFP should be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Registration with the CCR is mandatory prior to Subcontract award so interested parties are encouraged to begin the CCR registration process as soon as possible.  
Responding to this request identifies your organization as an interested candidate only. Your submittal is not in response to a Request for Proposals (RFP).

See highlights in amended document.</p>
<p>Solicitation <br />DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of computer system research and development. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. <br />To address these concerns the UHPC program will pursue, but will not be limited to:</p>
<p>1) development and optimization of ExtremeScale architectures, technologies, execution models, and the critical co-design of hardware and software;<br />2) low-energy architectures and protocols for logic, memory, data access, and data transport;<br />3) dynamic systems that adapt to achieve optimal application execution goals;<br />4) dependable computer systems including resiliency and security at all system levels;<br />5) concurrency management and the efficient use of massively parallel resources;<br />6) locality-aware architectures to reduce data movement;</p>
<p>7) self-aware OS that manages real-time performance, dependability and system resources.<br />The UHPC program will develop solutions for radically new computer systems that overcome energy efficiency, dependability, and programmability challenges. The UHPC vision includes:<br />Efficiency: New system-wide (hardware and software) technology approaches to minimize energy dissipation per operation and maximize energy efficiency, without sacrificing scalability to ultra-high performance DoD applications.<br />Programmability: Develop new scalable system architectures and technologies that do not require application programmers to explicitly manage system complexity, in terms of architectural attributes with respect to data locality and concurrency, to achieve performance, time to solution and other goals.<br />Dependability: Develop a system-wide approach to achieve dependability through fault management techniques enabling an application to execute correctly through both failures and attacks, and to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information, while achieving the user's goals. These goals could include performance, time to solution, energy efficiency or power consumption. Dependability across all levels of a UHPC System Design that is nearly transparent to the user and hardware performance.<br />To realize this vision requires reinventing how computers process and manage data and how applications are developed and executed. UHPC System Designs that merely pursue evolutionary development will not be considered.</p>
<p>The UHPC Program will pursue research and development efforts that will explore the technologies and architectures required to enable the development of revolutionary computing systems and overcome "business as usual" advances. Scaling current technology and justifying this approach with feature size reduction arguments cannot accomplish the goals of the program. This can only be achieved via dedicated investment, hardware-software co-design, integrated design techniques that utilize open innovation. Since creating an open innovation environment will be a critical element throughout the UHPC program and heavily weighted in all program evaluations, it should be an important consideration in team formation and plans for working with researchers outside of the proposed team. It must be noted that innovation for the sake of innovation will not be sufficient; proposers must demonstrate the viability, applicability and value to the overall UHPC System Design. Computers based on a UHPC System Designs will deliver extreme scale performance for modern DoD computational applications. It is assumed that system designs developed under this program will be scalable to systems ranging from embedded terascale systems up through at least single cabinet petascale configurations.</p>

EVALUATION FACTORS
Potential Contractors shall be evaluated in terms of the factors/criteria identified below.  Submissions will be evaluated against the evaluation factors as they relate to the requirements of the solicitation, as well as evaluated for meeting mandatory responsibility criteria per FAR Subpart 9.1.  A detailed evaluation will be made of the submissions.  Submissions must demonstrate a thorough understanding of and the capability to accomplish the overall requirements as stated in the following evaluation factors. Firms will be evaluated on the following factors listed in descending order of importance: 

Evaluation Factor 1  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence 
The Board will evaluate the specialized experience on similar projects and the technical capabilities of the prime offeror and any subcontractors.  The Board will examine the effectiveness of the proposed project team to ensure the Offerors ability to coordinate the needs of several of the Governments key partners. This will include evaluating the management structure; coordination of disciplines; offices and/or subcontractors; and the prior working relationships between team members. Also to be reviewed is how successful the offeror is in integrating the needs of multiple clients/partners.  The Board will evaluate submissions to determine if a history of successful execution of designs for public administrative and recreation facilities, including Visitor Orientation and Learning facilities in environmentally sensitive settings can be demonstrated. Specifically the Board will evaluate offerors/teams experience with:  (a) Sustainable design; (b) Previous LEED-certified designs and projects; (c) Recreational design specifically addressing needs of multicultural communities; (d) Managing projects with natural resource agencies corporate cultures; (e) Designing interior/exterior spaces that effectively gather, engage and inspire people to interact and learn together; (f) Land planning of recreational day use areas and other public gathering and discovery spaces as well as Visitor Orientation and Learning facilities; (g) Producing designs for unique and sensitive environments which are integrated into the environment; and, (h) Energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.  Provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for those projects profiled under this category.  A minimum of five projects are desired and no more than ten will be reviewed. Include a representative floor plan, site plan, building section, or other appropriate drawing, and a minimum of two photographs must be included for each project.

The Board will examine and note the offerors organizational structure, approach and philosophy regarding construction management of small to medium construction projects (e.g. $100,000 to 50 million) with complex demands.  The Board will examine the offerors experience with design and/or construction management projects where community members, fundraising specialists/donors/board member, non profits, and/or diverse stakeholders had meaningful involvement in the process.  Please provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for two projects under this category.  

The Board will examine the offerors ability to produce notable and distinctive architecture while working within a design guideline framework.  Please provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for two projects under this category.  Include at least two photographs for each project.  The Board will investigate AutoCAD and design presentation software capabilities.  Responses should include software name, version and number and/or names of skilled operators on the team.  The Board will evaluate the scope of experience with the types of work and disciplines noted in the attached Statement of Work Document.

Evaluation Factor 2  Proximity Factor 
The Board shall consider the geographic proximity for coordination and communication with key Forest Service staff, and the offerors knowledge of locality.  It is expected that the majority of the work under this solicitation will be for the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA), Las Vegas.  The remaining work load may include locations throughout the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.  Consequently, a geographic location preference will be given for Las Vegas, Nevada and surrounding area (50 mile radius).  Scoring for the proximity factor will apply to office/key personnel locations for the lead architect-engineer firm and the construction management firm.  Other consultants that are part of the offerors team which would have an incidental role in meeting contract requirements (e.g., interpretative exhibit design, specialty technical experts, etc.) may be located outside of the geographic area without affecting the proximity score. 

The offeror should demonstrate knowledge of geological features (e.g. desert and mountain environments) climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique to the Las Vegas area and experience with local government organizations, regulations, laws and unique criteria associated with the construction climate in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. The offeror should demonstrate general knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are typical to National Forest locations within the remainder of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.

Evaluation Factor 3  Professional Qualifications 
The Selection Board will evaluate the education, training, registrations, professional certificates, awards, peer recognition, overall and relevant experience, and longevity of the key management and personnel with the offeror:  The Board will consider the level of education of the staff in the disciplines needed to successfully complete the work.  The Board will consider the availability of professionals with appropriate training in specialized subjects such as energy savings and energy modeling, building inspection services, new technologies and systems, environmentally sensitive design, construction techniques appropriate for the setting/locations, development of infrastructure and recreational sites, etc., as appropriate to support the development of the work of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and other National Forest locations within the Intermountain Region.  The Board will consider the offerors depth and breadth of staff with LEED (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) Accreditation as defined by the US Green Building Council.  The Board will consider the depth and disciplines on staff who are professionally registered Engineers, Architects, and Surveyors, etc. The designers or project managers in each discipline and surveyors must be registered in the state(s) services are proposed.  The Board will consider overall and relevant experience.  Relevant experience includes A-E work typical with that encountered in the Forest Service (e.g., visitor centers, interpretative and education facilities, campgrounds, play spaces, administrative offices, etc.) and A-E experience with federal land management agencies.  The Board will consider the longevity of key staff involved with the offeror and the offerors subcontractors, indicative of the stability and continuity of each offerors practice.

Evaluation Factor 4  Past Performance  
The Board will evaluate the past performance on design services and construction management on contracts of similar size and scope.  The Board will examine the documented past performance of the Offeror and Subcontractors in the Governments PPIRS site, (The Past Performance Information Retrieval System) a government database for Civilian Agencies.  The Board will evaluate the design quality, timeliness and cost controls implemented in projects of similar size (e.g. $100,000 to $50 million) and scope (described in Factor 2) in the public and/or private sector.  Provide a list of four projects with the project name, description, award price, final price, client name and contact information.  Include similar information on construction management projects.  The Board will examine the trend of repeat business with clients, which suggests strong long-term relationships. Please provide the specific project name, point of contact, phone number, email for three past clients to verify successful performance of the proposed Offeror.  The Board will compare the list of personnel involved in successful projects with the proposed team for the contract.  The availability of successful professionals with proven track records will be a key factor in the selection of a submission.

Evaluation Factor 5  Capacity to Accomplish the Work 
Provide a brief narrative regarding the size of the firms (prime and subcontractors), current workload (number of projects and dollar value), and ability to absorb additional work.  The Board will consider an offeror's experience with similar size projects and the available capacity of key disciplines when evaluating the capacity of a offeror to perform the work. The board will consider the full potential value of any current contracts that a offeror has been awarded when evaluating capacity.  The Board will evaluate evidence of the success of long term relationships between the offerors proposed team (prime and subconsultants) which suggests the ability to work together and accomplish successful projects. An exhibit illustrating past projects where the multiple firms of the offerors team have worked together should be submitted to assist the agency in understanding this element. 

Evaluation Factor 6  Oral Interview 
Oral interviews will be required in the second stage of evaluations for the short-listed firms notified by the government.  This factor is included in this synopsis for information only and is not to be included in the submissions to this synopsis posting.  Interviews will be conducted with the offerors determined to be the most qualified based on evaluation of SF-330s and Evaluation Factors 1-5.  Interviews will be conducted with a minimum of three offerors and no more than six offerors.  Interviews will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, and will last no longer than two hours.  Offerors should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation factors and demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  The key project staff from the offerors team (prime and subconsultants) should attend the interview, up to ten persons.  Emphasis will be placed on the lead designer/engineer-A/E teams understanding of the unique aspects of the SMNRA Middle Kyle Complex project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance processes.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Research Opportunity Description
The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is interested in White Papers for long and short term Research and Development (R&D) projects that offer potential for advancement and improvements in the implementation of shipboard Integrated Power Systems (IPS) at the major component, subsystem and system level.  IPS provides total ship electric power including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, combat system support and ship mission load interfaces to the electric power system.  The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ship's mission at the lowest total ownership cost (TOC).  Systems engineering in IPS is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types and in developing modules that will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies with standard interfaces that are Navy controlled.  The modules or components developed will be assessed for applicability both to next generation shipboard electrical architectures and combat systems and to back-fit opportunities that improve the energy efficiency and mission effectiveness in the current fleet.  NAVSEA wishes to continue to improve IPS by performing analysis, modeling and simulation, life cycle cost analysis, producibility studies, module development, ship integration, architecture design, ship electric architectures and support for high power weapons systems requirements, and related efforts.  An evaluation of emerging technologies for ship applications (such as fuel cells, support for high energy weapons, support for high power radars, high-speed generators, and advanced power electronics) to determine future feasibility and development requirements will be conducted.  The approach to hardware developed under this BAA is that it fosters modularity and scalability (so that families of products may be leveraged to multiple potential applications) and shall accommodate an open system architecture where interfaces are well defined and mutually accepted.
Electric Ships Office:  The Navy has initiated the Next Generation Integrated Power Systems (NGIPS) effort with centralized leadership by the Electric Ships Office (ESO).  The mission of the ESO (PMS 320, organizationally a part of the Program Executive Office - Ships) is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more capable ship's power systems for all Navy platforms by defining open architectures, developing common components, and focusing Navy and industry investments.  The ESO will provide leadership of the developments identified as part of this BAA, will direct the transition of associated technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and will manage the technology portfolio represented by Program Element (PE) 0603573N (Advanced Surface Machinery Systems) for transition into existing and future Navy ships.  The guiding document that will be used to define the module developments that advance the NGIPS vision is the Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) Technology Development Roadmap, Naval Sea Systems Command Ser 05D/349 of 30 Nov 2007, which is publicly available under announcement N00024! 08R4123.	NGIPS:  The areas of focus for White Papers and Proposals submitted in response to this BAA should include, but are not limited to, the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of future shipboard electric power systems and components, emphasizing shipboard power generation, propulsion, conversion, distribution and control; power quality, continuity, and system stability; electric power system/component level modeling and simulation; energy storage technologies; electrical system survivability; simplicity and ruggedness.  The Integrated Power Architecture provides the framework for partitioning the equipment and software of NGIPS into modules and defines functional elements and the power/control and information relationships between them.  For power generation, high power distribution, propulsion, and large loads, the NGIPS architecture includes Medium Voltage AC power (with emphasis on affordability), High Frequency AC power (with emphasis on power density in the near term), and Medium Voltage DC power (with emphasis on power density and fault management in the far term).  For ship service electrical loads, NGIPS includes zonal electrical distribution which may be either AC or DC, depending upon the specific application.  In addition to a full IPS implementation, modules that support a paritally integrated power system, or Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) where mechanical propulsion is augmented by rotating machinery off of the propulsion train for propulsion, or additional power generation shall be considered.  Also of particular interest are technologies that result in significant energy efficiency and/or carbon footprint improvements over existing propulsion and power system technologies.  The NGIPS roadmap partitions the power system components functionally into modules.  Those modules, subsystems and systems of interest include the following.
Power Generation Module (PGM):  A Power Generation functional element converts fuel into electrical power. The electrical power is transferred to one or more Power Distribution functional elements.  An associated Power Generation module might typically consist of a gas turbine or diesel engine, a generator, a rectifier (either active or passive), auxiliary support sub-modules and module controls. Other possible technologies include propulsion derived ship service (PDSS), fuel cells, or other direct energy conversion concepts.  Power Generation concepts include 60 Hz wound rotor synchronous generator driven directly by a marine gas turbine (up to 30 MVA rating); 4 pole, 120 Hz, commercially derived or militarized design variants of the above; and higher speed, higher frequency, high power density variants of the above with high speed or geared turbine drive.  The specific design issues to be considered include fuel efficiency, machine insulation system characteristics, size, weight, cost, maintainability, availability, harmonic loading, voltage, power, fault protection, voltage and frequency response to large dynamic loading, interface to main or ship service bus, and commercial availability.
Power Distribution Module (PDM):  A Power Distribution functional element transfers electrical power between other functional elements. Fault protection systems should be designed, if possible, to not require the power distribution modules to communicate control signals with any functional element other than system control. An associated Power Distribution module might typically consist of bus duct, cables, switchgear and fault protection equipment.
Power Conversion Module (PCM):  A Power Conversion functional element converts electrical power from one form to another.  An associated Power Conversion module might typically consist of a solid state power converter and/or a transformer.  Advanced topologies and technologies, such as the application of wide band gap devices, will be considered.
Power Load Module (PLM):  A Power Load functional element is a user of electrical power received from one or more Power Distribution functional elements. The area of interest for NGIPS in the Power Load is the load interface definition and the provision of specialty power to optimize that load interface.  Among the special load interfaces that would require development are support for pulsed power weapons and sensors such as radar power supplies, electromagnetic launchers (for example EM Railgun), and advanced laser systems, all of which would benefit from optimized integration with the shipboard power system.  This would enable real time data and asset management and reconfiguration based on demand.
Propulsion Motor Module (PMM):  Electric propulsion motors and propulsion motor drives are large electrical loads as well as NGIPS modules.  Candidate propulsion motor concepts include Permanent Magnet Motors (radial air gap, axial air gap, or transverse flux), Induction Motors (wound rotor or squirrel cage), Superconducting field type (homopolar DC or synchronous AC).  The drivers and issues associated with these designs include acoustic signature, noise (requirements, limitations, modeling, sources, and mitigation methods), shock, vibration, coolant temperature, manufacturing infrastructure, machine insulation system characteristics, commercial commonality, platform commonality, cost, torque, power, weight, diameter, length, voltage, motor configuration, and ship arrangements constraints.  Motor drives that may be explored include cycloconverter (with variations in control and power device types), pulse width modulated converter/inverter (with many variations in topology), switching (hard switched, soft switched), and matrix converter (with variations in control, topology, cooling, power device type).  Technologies for drives and rotating machines which allow the ability to operate both as a motor and a generator to facilitate a propulsion derived ship service (PDSS) installation or on a fully integrated power system to leverage the inherent energy storage in the ship's motion may be explored. Integrated motor/propulsor concepts may be considered either as aft-mounted main propulsion or as a forward propulsor capable of propelling a ship at a tactically useful speed.
Energy Storage Module (ESM):  An Energy Storage functional element stores energy.  A number of alternative energy storage technologies and/or configurations (location within the distribution system and capacity) may be considered for future ship applications, such as battery, capacitor-based, fuel cell, fly wheel, or superconducting energy storage. Shipboard power quality and continuity along with examination of the implications of future high power/pulse power loads on configuration/technology alternatives is critical.  Energy storage modules may consist of short term (micro/milli second) or long term (minutes/hours) energy storage applications which utilize a combination of technologies to minimize power quality and continuity impacts across the system.
Power System Control (PCON):  A System Control functional element consists of the software necessary to coordinate multiple other functional elements. A System Control Functional Element receives information from other functional elements and external (non-IPS) systems. Similarly, a System Control functional element may receive control commands from or negotiate control actions with external systems and other functional elements. System Control manages the power and energy flow within the ship to ensure power is delivered to the right load in the right form at the right time.  While various forms of power control have been implemented on commercial IPS ships, the survivability requirements for military ships combined with the pulse load characteristics for some of the loads described above will require more sophisticated algorithms than are commercially available.  A System Control functional element resides on an external distributed computer system and therefore typically does not include hardware elements (unless specialized hardware is required).

<DESC>The 354th Contracting Squadron will be soliciting a 100%, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 354th CES mission at Eielson AFB, Alaska. The contract will be comprised of three base contracts to be awarded competively. Individual task(s) order(s) work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be a minimum of $2,000 per call and a maximum of $3,000,000.00 per call. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum for each of the contracts is $10 million per year. The total maximum value of the contract for all three contractors for all three years is $90 million. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and two 12-month option periods. There is a guaranteed minimum of $100k for each awardee.<br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 - Construction; Subsection 236 - Construction of Buildings with a size standard $33.5 Million; Subsector 237 - Heavy Construction with a size standard $13 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities) and Subsector 238 - Specialty Trade Contractors - Size standard $14 Million. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos/lead-based paint abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete, masonry, steel, painting, roofing and paving, locations of work will be at Eielson AFB, AK and may include Clear AS, Air Force Recreational site at Birch Lake, or in any of the various exercise and bomb ranges in interior Alaska (the PACIFIC Alaska Range Complex, or PARC). Offers are solicited only from business concerns who are current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code under 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.
<p><br />A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to three (3) contracts (three Hub Zone certified business concerns), who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The magnitude of the seed project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.<br />The seed projects general description is as follows:</p>
<p>The intent of project is to completely renovate the Army Lift Station, Building 2212, during which time the awardee shall provide interim grinding and pumping of sewerage to the Eielson Waste Water Treatment Plant. The Air Force requires a complete and functional design and renovation of this lift station, appropriate for the sub-arctic environment of interior Alaska and that meet all applicable current requirements of all applicable codes. The lift station was originally constructed in 1953 with new equipment installed in 1991. The Army lift station has become outdated and has reached the conclusion of its expected normal duty life. Maintenance issues are becoming more frequent and failure of existing equipment is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Up to three (3) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive basic contract award. Evaluation factors will be defined in the RFP. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project. All future task orders will be competed among contract awardees.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 17 Mar 2009 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>
<p><br />A site visit will be conducted at Eielson AFB, on or around 24 March 2010 (exact date, time and location will be provided in the RFP), for the purpose of explaining the concepts involved with the project and answering questions regarding the project and solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Any questions must be submitted in writing, please send them by e-mail to both SrA Mark A. Chranowski, mark.chranowski@eielson.af.mil (907-377-0108) and Mr. Jonathan Dittmer, johnathan.dittmer@eielson.af.mil. (907-377-5444). QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE TAKEN BY PHONE CALL.</p>

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<BR>EN has a need to issue a task order with ARRA funding. The original scope of services is:<BR><BR>The contractor shall conduct two geophysical investigations to characterize groundwater seepage along the right bank of the Jim Woodruff Dam Project. The investigation shall map subsurface preferential flow paths through the limestone foundation material. The survey shall be conducted by energizing the groundwater with a signature alternating electric current, and then measuring the magnetic field generated at the surface using a sensitive magnetic receiver. Each investigation shall be conducted in two phases. The initial phase shall consist of collecting magnetic readings on a course grid pattern (approximately 20 meters by 40 meters), in order to identify anomalies areas. The second phase shall consist of collecting more magnetic readings tighter grid spacing in the anomalous areas, so as to closely map groundwater flow paths. <BR><BR>The task order will increase the area of the geophysical investigation to include the left bank area of the Jim Woodruff Dam Project. This task order is required to help map potential seepage paths under the spillway and earthen dam.<BR><BR><BR>All other information remains unchanged.

ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS INTERNET / INTRANET The contractor shall comply with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Directive 6102 and VA Handbook 6102 (Internet/Intranet Services). VA Directive 6102 sets forth policies and responsibilities for the planning, design, maintenance support, and any other functions related to the administration of a VA Internet/Intranet Service Site or related service (hereinafter referred to as Internet).   This directive applies to all organizational elements in the Department.  This policy applies to all individuals designing and/or maintaining VA Internet Service Sites; including but not limited to full time and part time employees, contractors, interns, and volunteers.  This policy applies to all VA Internet/Intranet domains and servers that utilize VA resources.  This includes but is not limited to va.gov and other extensions such as, .com, .edu, .mil, .net, .org, and personal Internet service pages managed from individual workstations. VA Handbook 6102 establishes Department-wide procedures for managing, maintaining, establishing, and presenting VA Internet/Intranet Service Sites or related services (hereafter referred to as Internet).  The handbook implements the policies contained in VA Directive 6102, Internet/Intranet Services.  This includes, but is not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Web pages, Active Server Pages (ASP), e-mail forums, and list servers. VA Directive 6102 and VA Handbook 6102 are available at: http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=410&FType=2 In addition, any technologies that enable a Network Delivered Application (NDA) to access or modify resources of the local machine that are outside of the browser's "sand box" are strictly prohibited.  Specifically, this prohibition includes signed-applets or any ActiveX controls delivered through a browser's session.  ActiveX is expressly forbidden within the VA while .NET is allowed only when granted a waiver by the VA CIO *PRIOR* to use. JavaScript is the preferred language standard for developing relatively simple interactions (i.e., forms validation, interactive menus, etc.) and Applets (J2SE APIs and Java Language) for complex network delivered applications.  I.  CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE It is agreed that: 1. The preliminary and final deliverables and all associated working papers, application source code, and other materials deemed relevant by the VA which have been generated by the contractor in the performance of this task order are the exclusive property of the U.S. Government and shall be submitted to the CO or designee at the conclusion of the task order. 2. The CO or designee will be the sole authorized official to release verbally or in writing, any data, the draft deliverables, the final deliverables, or any other written or printed materials pertaining to this task order. No information shall be released by the contractor. Any request for information relating to this task order presented to the contractor shall be submitted to the CO or designee for response. 3. Press releases, marketing material or any other printed or electronic documentation related to this project, shall not be publicized without the written approval of the CO or designee.   J.	START DATEIt is imperative that the successful contractor be ready and able to begin service at 12:01 A. M. on Saturday, April 17, 2001. To ensure readiness, the contractor shall indicate in their proposal whether or not the proposed staff is currently employed by the offeror and available to initiate work on 12:01 AM April 17, 2010.K.

Pricing information shall not be included in the technical proposal.TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUIREMENTSSTAFFING RESUMES:Describe how the contract will be staffed to ensure satisfactory performance with an emphasis on qualified and experienced staff that are available and ready to begin service at 12:01 A.M. on Saturday April 17, 2010.Resumes, no more than two (2) pages in length, shall be provided for all personnel.  Each resume must include sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed individual has the expertise, knowledge, and certifications to perform the work.  In addition, the resume of proposed individuals who are not currently employed by the contractor shall be accompanied by a Letter of Commitment signed by both the contractor and the employee acknowledging acceptance of an employment offer under the resulting order.  As these individuals will be "key personnel" under the proposed contract, submission of these resumes is considered a commitment on the part of the contractor that, should the contractor be awarded the contract, the proposed individuals will be assigned to perform it. Replacement of any proposed individual during performance shall be with an individual of equal or better qualifications and experience as the individual replaced.   PAST PERFORMANCE REFERENCES:Provide not more than 3 past performance references (not-to-exceed 2 pages each) providing relevant contact and performance information for similar projects (in size and scope) completed or in process over the past 3 years.  References may be from commercial and federal/state government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal government customers with an emphasis on those provided to the Department of Veterans Affairs will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  A minimum of 1 past performance must be submitted by the Prime Contractor demonstrating relevant PBX maintenance and support services. The following information is required for each reference: 1. Customer name and address. 2. Point of contact (name, title, telephone number, and fax number) for contractual/administrative matters (e.g., the CO) and technical performance (e.g., the COTR). 3. Contract number. 4. Total dollar value of the contract.  5. Pricing arrangement (firm fixed-price, labor-hour, etc.) 6. Period of contract performance. 7.

EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of the following 4 factors:  1. Staffing Resumes 2. Past Performance  3. Management Solution 4. Price  The Government intends to make the award to the responsible Contractor offering the best value in terms of technical merit, past performance and price.   The non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Any quotation received that fails to comply with the requirements of this solicitation may be determined to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This action is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Actof 2009. Task 085-R is a research and development effort. Research funded by this taskwill focus on addressing the capacity challenges facing the US national airspace. It hasbeen forecast that over the next 15 years, air traffic in the United States will double,far exceeding the countrys current capability to safely fly aircraft. To handle thisgrowth, NASA is contributing to the development of the Next Generation Air TransportationManagement System (NextGen).In support of these efforts, the UARC will investigate new approaches to safelyincreasing the number of aircraft that can operate in the national airspace at any giventime.  More specifically, air traffic management research funded by this task will focuson developing simulation capabilities, such as creating appropriate test scenarios,integrating the appropriate hardware and software, and managing human-in-the-loopsimulations themselves, in order to demonstrate more efficient approaches to schedulingaircraft arrivals in the congested airspace near major airports. This award notice is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The task order is issued under anexisting Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract NAS2-03144, which was made on a competitive basis.Due to the variability of this research and development work a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee taskorder was determined appropriate.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This action is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Actof 2009. Task 086-R is a research and development effort. Research funded by this taskwill focus on addressing the capacity challenges facing the US national airspace. It hasbeen forecast that over the next 15 years, air traffic in the United States will double,far exceeding the countrys current capability to safely fly aircraft. To handle thisgrowth, NASA is contributing to the development of the Next Generation Air TransportationManagement System (NextGen).In support of these efforts, the UARC will investigate new approaches to safelyincreasing the number of aircraft that can operate in the national airspace at any giventime. More specifically, research funded by this task will focus on integratingstate-of-the-art trajectory synthesis tools with ground-based scheduling capabilitiesthat will help airports manage arrival traffic more efficiently. Accurate trajectoryprediction is needed to enable advanced ground scheduling capabilities. Work under thistask will include: a review of current state-of-the-art trajectory synthesis tools;integration of the tools; development of common scenarios for testing the tools; andinitial analyses of trajectory synthesis results. This award notice is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The task order is issued under anexisting Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract NAS2-03144, which was made on a competitive basis.Due to the variability of this research and development work a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee taskorder was determined appropriate.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This action is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Actof 2009. The work of task 087-R is to provide systems engineering and system integrationto assist in the development of a follow-on instrument to the MODIS Airborne Simulator(MAS). The Enhanced MAS or EMAS will provide important measurements in support of ongoingcalibration and validation activities for the MODIS instruments, while supporting thedevelopment of algorithms for future spaceborne systems. The system will be composed of 3subsystems that together will provide high quality measurements of atmosphericconstituents by measuring absorption, scattering and reflectance of incoming solarradiation. This new system might eventually replace NASAs MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS)with higher quality measurements than are currently available within the agency.This award notice is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The task order is issued under anexisting Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract NAS2-03144, which was made on a competitive basis.Due to the variability of this research and development work a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee taskorder was determined appropriate.

<DESC>This BPA call was issued against L10PA00578.  The BPA was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   The BPA was competed amongst GSA contract holders and Premier Data Services proved to provide the best value to the government.  Below is a general description of the services required.
This project will involve scanning approximately 500,000 land status records from micro-graphic copies of legal documents mounted on aperture cards.  Of this, approximately 273,086 will be completed under the base obligation, and 226,914 will be available as an option line item and completed if funding becomes available.  The database this creates will enable the BLM to more efficiently evaluate leases for renewable energy or other projects more efficient, thereby saving the public and agency time in the application process.  This will also improve the automation and quality assurance of BLMs current land status information.

<p>FAR Part 6.302-1 provides that a sole source award is authorized when the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.&nbsp; Center operators are awarded contracts to operate Job Corps Centers through a competitive solicitation process.&nbsp; Center operators are in the unique position, as the only responsible source, to coordinate the necessary changes required by this sole source awarded modification. As the only responsible source, they are expected and contractually required to provide relevant and rigorous training curricula, training equipment and to maintain the facilities.</p>
<p>The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:&nbsp; Earth Day Every Day, to assist with preparation and execution of the week's activities. This budget has been allocated to center operators from ARRA funds and should only be used to purchase activity supplies outlined in the booklet referenced in PIN 09-33, as well as to procure a tree and tree marker for the center.&nbsp; The operator of the Puerto Rico Job Corps Centers will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>BACKGROUND
The OCR promotes and ensures that people have equal access to and opportunity to participate in and receive services from all HHS-funded programs without facing unlawful discrimination, and that the privacy of their health information is protected. OCR has primary responsibility for implementation and enforcement of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which provides important health information privacy protections and rights for individuals. OCRs enforcement activities include investigation of alleged violations and initiation of compliance reviews to determine compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 160 and 164 Subpart E). OCR is committed to developing and enforcing strong health information privacy protections that do not impede access to quality health care. For more information about OCR enforcement of the Privacy Rule, see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/index.html.

The Privacy Rule is one of a suite of regulations (including the Security Rule (45 CFR 160 and 164 Subpart C) and Standards for Transactions and Code Sets (45 CFR 160 and 162)) promulgated pursuant to the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA.
Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub. L. No. 111-5,  13411, 123 Stat. 115, 276 (2009), Congress provided additional tools for enforcement of these administrative simplification requirements. Among other new provisions, ARRA authorizes a State Attorney General (AG) to bring an action on behalf of state residents to enjoin a defendant from further violation or to obtain damages. This new enforcement authority requires coordination between HHS and state attorneys general and provides HHS with the means to intervene in state actions. 

To assist state attorneys general in their efforts to exercise their new enforcement authority and promote productive and effective enforcement relationships with them, OCR will develop and convene a series of training seminars focused on enforcement of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. OCR will also develop and make available the training in other modalities to ensure continuing access to the instruction. This request for proposals seeks a Contractor to provide support in the development and delivery of training and other outreach materials and tools in a variety of modalities. Classroom training seminars will be conducted by HHS staff, with logistical support from the Contractor.

<DESC>(Subject Continued)  Equipment, West Point Lake, Georgia<br><br>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Anderson Constuction Company, W91278-06-C-0003<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already in the midst of the job and this modification is to add funding needed to complete the work.  2)  The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in 31 recreation areas, three operations areas, and the Project Management Office.  3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) issued against BAA-09-0002.  Cost contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost arrangement.  In addition, appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.<BR><BR>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>Memo to the fileBackup for 2268This procurement is a sole source to Advanced Signal for four months which is a follow on contract to maintain the old fire alarm system while the conversion to the new system is completed. Due to the fact Advanced Signal has the background investigation, security clearances and knowledge of the old obsolete system; it is advantageous to the Government not to re-procure this for the additional three months.  Advanced Signal was originally a small business who was taken over by American Alarm therefore resulting in the transformation to a large business.  Price reasonableness was evaluated by prices paid previous years and determined reasonable.  The quote confirmation of pricing was confirmed on 02/04/10 with Joe Giambetti from American Alarm & Co. Quoted price is $25,000.00 for four months. Fiscal year 08, 09, and 10 pricing, C80090, C90060, and C00193 is identical to quote for current quarter requirements. American Alarm & Co, has been determined responsible in accordance with FAR Part 9, based on the results of the past performance history with work at the VA.Once the new system testing is complete a competitive procurement will be issued for fire alarm maintenance.  The testing of the new system will be completed in July therefore replacing the current system and ending the contract with American Alarm.   Prepared by //s//Karla RotondoContract SpecialistApproved:Kimberly ChoplinContracting Officer
