Authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the SAI represents a significant enhancement of DOE's business strategy of partnering with the U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of PV system research and development (R&D) to meet aggressive cost and installed capacity goals. This Solicitation is targeted at innovative R&D on PV cell and module prototypes with demonstrated functionality in either large-area cell/module form or, preferably, prototypes produced in pilot-scale operations. The emphasis on proposed activities should be on the barriers to manufacturing scale-up and 2012 commercialization. The primary objective of this program is to shorten the timeline for companies to transition prototype and pre-commercial PV technologies into pilot and full-scale manufacture. Responders to this Solicitation are expected to focus their efforts on a limited number of high impact areas that lie on the critical path to scaling-up their technology to full manufacture. The minimum entrance criterion is demonstrated PV cells or process lab devices or modules. The successful exit criterion is for prototype modules and pilot production demonstration >5MW/year. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that 6 to 10 subcontracts, up to $3M each, will be awarded as 18-month phased subcontracts. A Net Conference regarding the project is scheduled for Monday, March 6, 2009, 9:30 A.M. Mountain Time. The Solicitation will be available to view/download on or about February 16, 2009 from NREL's website at: http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html.

Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Network Appliance support for existing SAN equipment at BIMC and KCC.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST Enterprise Systems owns and has in use Network Appliance SAN equipment.  As part of CA/CSTs migration from CLASS to eCLASS, CST purchased and installed 4 Storage Area Networks (SANs) from Network Appliances (NetApp).  The support for the hardware expired on 11/4/2008.  The SAN equipment, however, is still in use and is an essential part to CA/CST Enterprise Systems operations.  By extending the support for the equipment, CA can ensure that Network Appliance will provide premium 7x24 hour onsite support. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance SAN equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. According to Network Appliance, the only provider of Network Appliance SupportEdge Premium 7x24 4 hour onsite support is Network Appliance.  The services are currently not offered by any other provider.
CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance SAN.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

As this is a brand anme only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the tiems identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only products that meet the Department's requirements, for the following reasons.  Marconi ATM - the parts and equipment that are utilized by DoS are specific to Ericcson. In order to achieve a high level of standardization and increase the government's opportunities for cost-avoidance, GTS has standardized parts and equipment for the ATM utilized to support its Information Technology (IT) mission.   Ericcson - In the DoS' Secondary Control Facility, the Ericcson parts and equipment that exist today is used for the Marconi ATM which supports the domestic ClassNet backbone.  Any other part or equipment that is not maufactured by Ericcson will not adhere to the DoS standard.  Custom manufactured equipment must meet DoS approved standards in the Secondary Tech Control Facility.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.106(b), the Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office intends to negotiate a sole source award to J.W. Bibler & Associates, a small business vendor, for a follow-on independent assessment of Idaho National Lab (INL) and the Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) project management processes and practices to identify areas of notable success and those needing improvement.  The estimated cost for the assessment is $20,000 and will be conducted sometime between July 1, 2009 and Dec. 1, 2009.
The work provided under this award include: 1) Review INL and DOE-ID Project Management Plans and related process and procedural documents addressing project management prior to conducting site visits and interviews; 2) Conduct site visits and interviews with DOE-ID and INL personnel; 3) Prepare and deliver a final report; and 4) Provide briefings to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) at DOE-ID.
Background:  From October 1, 2003 through November 2007, Jim Bibler, of J.W. Bibler and Associates, designed and conducted Contract Management Seminar Series (CMSS) that equipped the workforce of DOE-ID with the knowledge, tools, and processes needed for successful management of the INL and the Idaho Cleanup Project (ICP) contracts.  As follow on to the CMSS under a separate contract, Mr. Bibler conducted an independent assessment of DOE-ID?s contract management processes.  In subsequent assessments, Mr. Bibler obtained in-depth knowledge of DOE-ID, DOE Headquarters, and the Idaho site contractor organizations and the interactions necessary to accomplish the DOE-ID mission.  To duplicate this knowledge and understanding in order to perform this assessment would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date of June 10, 2009.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award to J. W. Bibler & Associates.  Responses are due by June 10, 2009, 3:00 p.m. (MDT).  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to surrusjk@id.doe. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to issue a modification to existing Purchase Order number HHSN268200800503P, with <strong>University of Vermont</strong>, 208 South Park Drive, Suite 2, Colchester, Vermont 05446.&nbsp; Through non-competitive procedures, the University of Vermont was issued a Purchase Order to provide support in a Genome Wide Association Study to determine the Etiology of Benign Ethnic Neutropenia in African-Americans (Ancillary study of the REGARDS database).&nbsp; The purpose of this modification is for the continuation of services under clinical protocol number 03-H-0168 and will involve extraction of DNA from blood cells collected from individuals in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS) clinical trial.&nbsp; Approximately 1,600 samples are requested.&nbsp; The process of obtaining the DNA consists of the following:&nbsp; 1) DNA extraction and quantification, per sample; 2) DNA samples election and data management; and 3) DNA sample preparation for Illumina.&nbsp; The majority of this work will be performed at the University of Vermont in Burlington, and the period of performance is expected to end on September 28, 2009.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement of Work</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />White blood cell (WBC) count in African-Americans has been identified to be lower than that of other ethnic backgrounds.&nbsp; This project of the Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch (MCHB) of the National Institute for Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) will be collaborating with Dr. Stephen Chanock of the National Cancer Institute to determine the genetic basis that determines the steady-state WBC in African-Americans.<br /><br />Though individuals of all ethnic backgrounds have been reported to have small reductions in WBC, more individuals of African descent have been reported to have low WBC (leukopenia): Africans, African-Caribbeans, West Indians, Ethiopians and Yemenite Jews, and certain Arabs.&nbsp; Asymptomatic leukopenia in African-American workmen was first described in 1941, and has subsequently been reported in larger studies in the U.S. <br /><br />The investigators at the NIH queried the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004 database and showed that the prevalence of leukopenia was 4.5% in blacks, 0.8% in non-Hispanic whites (whites), and 0.4% in Mexican-Americans (MAs).&nbsp; The higher prevalence in blacks was also observed in the previous NHANES spanning over 3 decades, validating that leukopenia in African-Americans is a real condition, is still observed throughout the US, and potentially affects up to 2 million African-Americans.<br /><br />The etiology of this leukopenia remains elusive, and appears not to be associated with infections, drugs, cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic disturbances, or other hematologic disorders.&nbsp; There is no associated risk of oral or systemic infections as seen in other forms of congenital neutropenia.&nbsp; On bone marrow examinations, there were adequate myeloid progenitors and mature granulocytes.&nbsp; In vitro bone marrow progenitor colony assays showed no deficiency in granulocyte colony forming cells. Under stress of viral or bacterial infections, neutrophils of these individuals appeared to function properly.&nbsp; The clinical course of these infections is not more severe, and does not last longer or require longer therapy.<br /><br />The investigators then began a systematic investigation to identify the cause of the leukopenia and to have an active clinical protocol to enroll subjects with leukopenia to fully characterize this condition.&nbsp; The protocol number is 03-H-0168 (formerly 03-DK-0168) and is registered at <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>.&nbsp; One aspect of this investigation is to ascertain the genetic basis for this condition.<br /><br />Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS) is a national population-based collection of white and African-American individuals.&nbsp; This database contains pertinent laboratory, medical history information, and stored cells to extract DNA.&nbsp; The database is maintained at the University of Alabama in Birmingham.&nbsp; This cohort is an ideal target to answer the question, why does leukopenia exist in African-Americans? This database is uniquely positioned to best answer the research question because it contains the largest cohort of African-Americans in a longitudinal clinical trial.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611310, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million.&nbsp; This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.&nbsp; This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>This is not a solicitation and does not guarantee that the Government will proceed with a solicitation or award of a contract in the future. This notice is only for market research purposes.</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential business that can provide the services below.</p>
<p>The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that women of childbearing age consume 0.4 mg/day of folic acid to prevent neural tube defects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Folate is a water-soluble essential nutrient that is required for DNA methylation, a critical mechanism of maintaining appropriate gene expression and chromosomal integrity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In controlled metabolic studies, global DNA methylation has been shown to be responsive to changes in folic acid intake, however no study has evaluated dose-dependent methylation changes associated with long term folic acid supplementation. Previous studies indicate that DNA methylation may be negatively affected by a genetic polymorphism (677C&rarr;T) which reduces the activity of a key folate enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Our initial studies have found there are age, dose and genotype dependent changes in global DNA methylation levels in response to folic acid supplementation and withdrawal among certain dosage of folic acid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This first of its kind population based study has generated a number of new hypotheses and requires timely follow-up to begin to elucidate the implications of these findings. We plan to test additional DNA samples (additional dosages and the B12 deficient cohort) for global and site specific changes to determine if there are additional changes in the DNA (uracil) and gene-gene interactions. The purpose of this project is to determine the normal patterns of DNA methylation and levels of uracil mis-incorporation and how these patterns change in response to folic acid supplementation and individual genotypes. The requirement is to utilize global methylation assay - liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the ratio of methylcytosine to cytosine. <strong>This effort requires the Contractor to have the capability to perform this technique to yield sensitive and reproducible results with inter and intra assay variation less than 5%.</strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The vendor shall perform the following tasks:&nbsp;</p>

Housing of Squirrel Monkeys-- Potential of Candidate Cell Substrate for Vaccine Production to Propagate TSE Agents

Request for Information (RFI):
This is a RFI in accordance with FAR 15.201 (e) to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.  It is emphasized that this is a notice solely for planning and informational purposes only and is not be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.  Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is solely seeking to identify any sources with capabilities or prior experience that can perform the following: 

Background:

Since the early 1990s, FDA has expressed a concern about the theoretical risk that the infectious agents causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) might accidentally contaminate cell substrates used to prepare fda-regulated biological products (1, 2). In the past, some cell cultures were experimentally infected with TSE agents, though infections have generally been difficult to achieve and maintain (3). Recent work of two groups, successfully infecting murine cultures with scrapie agent (4, 5), rekindled interest in the phenomenon. However, relatively little has been done to investigate the susceptibility of cell cultures used or under investigation as substrates to produce vaccines and other biologics. We are investigating the ability of several relevant cell lines to sustain infection and propagate TSE agents, with special emphasis on the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). We assay cultures for infectivity using several lines of transgenic (tg) mice engineered to increase their potential sensitivity to various TSE infections. We are also attempting to develop cell culture assays that might reduce the future need to perform bioassays of TSE agents in animals.


FDA Objectives:

Contractor would provide a USDA-approved BSL-3 facility (acceptable to FDA safety staff) for housing up to 48 squirrel monkeys. FDA presented an animal study proposal to its own Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Safety Committee and received approvals; the Contractor is expected to have for, received and maintained required approvals from its own authorities. In addition, the Contractor shall have current USDA approval and certification to handle the BSE agent in its BSL-3 animal and laboratory facilities. BSE-inoculated and cell-substrate-inoculated squirrel monkeys are to be observed daily by Contractors staff for signs of neurological illness (marked behavioral change, incoordination, weakness, and failure to eat, drink or groom), and FDA is to be notified if illness is suspected. No other special procedures are needed. Contractor is to provide routine veterinary care and necropsy service.

RFI Submission Instructions:

FDA will not award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDAs use of such information.  Responses will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal RFP.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.  Responses will be reviewed only by FDA personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.


Responses to the RFI should address the following: 

Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the capability and capacity to provide the services.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective analysis of respondents' capacity and capability to enable FDA to examine, analyze, review, verify, improve upon existing and develop, if necessary, mechanisms related to food safety and defense (protection) to protect, promote and preserve the publics health and well-being.  Responses shall directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting").

Part C: Organizational Conflict of Interest--If any, provide disclosure of business activities of your company, your affiliates, your team members and affiliates of your team members which create either a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest to provide a USDA-approved BSL-3 facility (acceptable to FDA safety staff) for housing up to 48 squirrel monkeys and enable FDA to keep vaccines and other injectable medicinal products free of contaminating agentsespecially infectious agents pathogenic for humans.

Part D: Security Requirements--At project completion, while the generated data, information and recommendations are considered public property, describe your ability to provide cleared contractor personnel for the project ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

Part E: Business SizeProvide your business size, ie. Small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses.  Although anticipated NAICS code is identified in the Fedbizopps posting, all NAICS codes will be reviewed.

Part F: Small Business--Describe your ability to meet the requirements in accordance with 52.219.14Limitation on Subcontracting.

Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is solely seeking to identify any sources with capabilities or prior experience that can perform the following: 

Background:

Since the early 1990s, FDA has expressed a concern about the theoretical risk that the infectious agents causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) might accidentally contaminate cell substrates used to prepare fda-regulated biological products (1, 2). In the past, some cell cultures were experimentally infected with TSE agents, though infections have generally been difficult to achieve and maintain (3). Recent work of two groups, successfully infecting murine cultures with scrapie agent (4, 5), rekindled interest in the phenomenon. However, relatively little has been done to investigate the susceptibility of cell cultures used or under investigation as substrates to produce vaccines and other biologics. We are investigating the ability of several relevant cell lines to sustain infection and propagate TSE agents, with special emphasis on the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). We assay cultures for infectivity using several lines of transgenic (tg) mice engineered to increase their potential sensitivity to various TSE infections. We are also attempting to develop cell culture assays that might reduce the future need to perform bioassays of TSE agents in animals.


FDA Objectives:

Contractor will provide a USDA-approved BSL-3 facility (acceptable to FDA safety staff) for housing up to 1140 Tg and TSE-susceptible mice. FDA presented an animal study proposal to its own Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Safety Committee and received approvals; the Contractor is expected to have for, received and maintained required approvals from its own authorities. In addition, the Contractor must have and maintain current USDA approval and certification to handle the BSE agent in its BSL-3 animal and laboratory facilities. Mice are to be observed daily by Contractors staff for signs of neurological illness and FDA is to be notified if illness is suspected.  No other special procedures are needed. Contractor will provide routine veterinary care.

RFI Submission Instructions:

FDA will not award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDAs use of such information.  Responses will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal RFP.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.  Responses will be reviewed only by FDA personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

<DESC>At this time, the Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch, intends to award a Fixed Price contract for TRAINING DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT (TD&S) - an 18 Week Pashtu Language Course.  The total length of the contract will be 7 months from the date of award.  If the results of this market survey indicate there is only one potential qualified sources that can support this proposed effort, the Government will consider issuing a sole source contract.  The Army's mission to engage and defeat terrorist threats requires that leaders fully understand how to train and integrate language enabled HUMINT Collectors with critical GWOT operational language proficiency on the battlefield.  Skilled language enabled HUMINT Collector integration requires leaders and soldiers to know how to apply language enabled proficiency skills that are force multipliers and provide force protection to meet their commanders' tactical requirements.  The immediate requirement is to design, develop, and implement an 18 week language course that can complete language enabled training without sacrificing basic language proficiency.Contractor will design, develop, and implement an 18 week language course necessary to train Pashtu language speakers at an Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) listening (L)1, Reading (R)1, speaking (S) 1 or basic level according to Army Language Management regulation 611-6 for support of GWOT operational language enabled requirements in accordance with prescribed learning theory and language training methodology.  The course will be attended by students who will become language enabled soldiers at ILR level L1/R1/S1 as measured by a DLI Diagnostic Assessment (DA) Team.   Additional tests may be used by the contractor, but not limited to, such as the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT), Language Testing International (LTI), ALTA, and the BYU reading test to gather supplemental data that will assist in monitoring student progress.  The contractor's language training will provide language enabled soldiers with critical skills and knowledge to effectively integrate operational language proficiency into the contemporary operational environment to support tactical commanders' language mission requirements where mission success is dependent upon effective intelligence and information gathering in the target language.  The contractor will conduct training analysis, design, and development for language acquisition, sustainment and maintenance as prescribed by Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulations and guidance.  Implementation and validation will be accomplished through language training sessions conducted by the contractor at specified locations. Contractor shall coordinate with appropriate directorates within the US Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca (USAIC&FH), training battalions, instructors, and contractors during the language training to ensure use of correct doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedure, and training protocols.  Contractor will incorporate lessons learned to date from military operations in the Contemporary Operating Environment COE),Global War on Terror (GWOT) in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Balkans, and other regions of the world.  Contractor Qualifications:  Contractor must have at least 3 years experience as a professional foreign language instructor, be an educated native or level 4 target language speaker and have 1-2 years experience with individual training development with knowledge of target language culture and cultural principles.  The contractor and staff must have strong English writing and speaking skills; 1-2 years experience in training development, organizational development, personnel proponency, or integration projects; a working knowledge of MS Office Professional (PowerPoint, Excel, and Word); Preferred skills, but not required include: Military experience; experience in educational course research, development, instructional methodology, and basic pedagogical principles; expertise and knowledge in the Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process; and expertise in the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) database.

<SUBJECT>Software and/or Vendors to Host a Digital Library Specific to Human Resources Based Content Requirements
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-09-OP-CES-WLRC
<RESPDATE>061609
<CONTACT>Deborah R Wilson, Contract Specialist, Phone (410) 594-2016, Fax (410) 965-9560, Email deborah.r.wilson@ssa.gov - Randall Pickwell, Contracting Officer, Phone (410) 966-1325, Fax (410) 965-9560, Email Randall.Pickwell@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting MARKET RESEARCH to identify existing Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software products and/or vendors capable of hosting a digital library specific to Human Resources based content requirements.

Background

SSA currently provides its employees with a variety of work/life support materials including books, Compact Disks (CDs), tapes, Digital Video Disc (DVDs), etc.  The Agency supplies these resources to employees through an existing nationwide distribution network.  SSA provides a limited amount of material to employees via an online website accessible through the SSA Intranet only.

The Agency also operates a traditional library of materials using both a take-out and a mail based distribution network to send materials to employees.  These distribution models incur expenses to SSA, and at times results in delays in the delivery of materials.  In addition, due to the nature of the existing media, resources become outdated in a short amount of time and newer/ updated materials need to be procured and entered into the distribution network.  Additionally, employees in remote locations may lack suitable access to these materials, and most SSA employees do not have time during working hours to utilize Intranet resources.

The primary subject matter of the material currently distributed involves work/life topics including, but not limited to, the following:

 Career Development
 Elder Care
 Child Care
 Healthy Living (e.g., Nutrition, Fitness, Disease Prevention, Health, Management, Substance Abuse and Addiction)
 Stress Management
 Self-Help
 Financial Planning
 Management Support

Technical Requirements

SSA management has identified a need to enable all employees timely, convenient, and fair access to suitable work/life support materials.  To address this need, SSA is seeking to identify existing virtual library type COTS software packages that will allow employees to access digital material using the Internet.

SSAs existing market research indicates that library software products in the commercial marketplace are currently available through the internet platform known as Web 2.0.  SSA is interested in suitable Web 2.0 based products that will allow for the publishing of print and electronic media and communication documents, books, research studies, and downloadable music and video in multiple formats (e.g., MP3, RTF, PDF, etc.) and allow for such downloads to a wide range of current digital devices (e.g. MP3, iPod, iPhones, blackberries, personal computers, eReaders, etc.).  SSA seeks to identify such products that can be remotely hosted tracked and monitored for usage outside of SSA's firewall to enable employees nationally 24/7 access the information at home, work, or other remote locations.

Ideally, the environment should be built and managed entirely by one vendor who is familiar with content management and can keep the content updated and dynamic.  Specific performance elements and technical characteristics that SSA has identified include:

 Robust platform: migrate-able 2-D to 3-D environment as content becomes available in 3D
 Architecture  exclusive access only to SSA employees; built and managed outside of the SSA firewall; tracking and monitoring capability
 Fully-interactive, self-guided experience from any perspective, viewpoint or path; built to scale capable of live, archived and video 
 Hyperlinks from room-to-room, hyperlinks to reference the web, drag-and-drop and much more 
 Library content resources  web 2.0 with platform and system ability to move into 3.0 environment as content is translated into 3-D
 Ability to add/submit content in video, music, audio, links, etc.
 Ready, easy access to content with "google-like" and indexing/mashing features

If purchased, such a remotely hosted products/software as a service must be subject to SSA Office of Systems approval and enabling, and must meet applicable Federal and Agency standards for use by Agency employees with disabilities (i.e., Section 508, SSA Accessibility Standards).

Administrative Requirements 

In addition to providing the software product as described above, SSA is interested in determining interested parties capabilities to provide associated administrative services related to the maintenance of the system and the provisioning of content.  Hosted content should be available to users in part or full for identified topics and retrievable via multiple options such as indexes, internal search engine, etc.  Specifically, the provider will be responsible for editing, writing, proofing, researching, indexing, clear copywriting, fact-checking, sub-titling, and mapping all or some of the content hosted by the solution.
Administrative services shall include: 

 archiving and inventory management services; 
 digital-on-demand publishing; 
 mail list and directory preparation; 
 tracking and reporting user access;
 website design and maintenance; and 
 document security. 

In addition to the information requested above, vendor responses to this notice should:

 Be specific as to the product(s) proposed.
 Include a description of how the vendors product is commonly sold in the commercial marketplace (e.g., initial price approaches, user license based, transaction based recurring pricing, price policies for solution maintenance, hourly or engagement based services pricing). 
 Include information on pricing, such as commercial catalogs or price lists.
 Indicate whether their services/products are available on General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules (GSA FSS) or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), and if applicable provide the relevant contract numbers.
 Provide examples of relevant corporate past performance information that demonstrates the vendors previous success in delivering solutions of similar size, scope, and complexity in the government or commercial marketplace.

Any firm that feels they have the capability of providing a product(s) that meets the requirements listed above must respond, in writing, via e-mail to the Contract Specialist by the response due date posted.  The Government will not consider vendor submissions of simple marketing materials or brochures, incomplete responses that do not conform to the elements of this request for information, or references to vendor websites.

This is not a request for proposal.  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ISSUING A FORMAL SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  The Government will not acknowledge requests for copies of a solicitation at this time.

The Government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in reply to this notice.  The Agency will use information submitted in response to this notice as market research efforts and for procurement planning purposes.  The Government reserves the right to contact, or not contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.

Contractors must submit all responses in an electronic format (compatible with MS Office 2003) via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Deborah R. Wilson by the due date specified.  The Government will not consider faxed information.  The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 megabytes. Electronic responses must be received by 5:00PM ET June 16, 2009.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<BR> <BR>Closing Date: 16 June 2009<BR><BR>Description:<BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI)/ Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators Threat Systems Management Office (PM ITTS TSMO) is seeking industry information and capabilities to conduct Threat CNO for Test and Evaluation events.<BR><BR>Background:<BR>Threat Computer Network Operations (CNO) Team is a program which satisfies Army and DoD requirements for a threat representative CNO capability for Operational Testing as detailed in Department of Testing and Evaluation (DOT&E) guidance and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)-sponsored Threat CNO Certification Process.  Threat CNO Team provides a realistic representation of the threat capability through the use of properly trained teams and certified professionals capable of executing threat Computer Network Attack (CNA) and Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), in accordance with a Threat Test Support Plan (TTSP) and supporting a threat commanders objectives, while employing threat doctrine, tactics, and techniques (DTT).  The CNO Team personnel must maintain the necessary training, certifications, and clearances to execute threat CNA on open and closed Army networks.  The threat CNA/ Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) capability of the Threat CNO Teams can represent a broad range threat CNO forces against a spectrum of U.S. operating systems, networks, protocols, computer components; proprietary, open and owned standards, COTS and GOTS resources, and languages. CNA/CNE is accomplished using open source (whether threat attributable or in general) tools, doctrine, techniques, tactics, procedures and exploits to provide a complete testing/training threat CNO environment.  In addition to the human element, exploitation tools and techniques that can be directly associated with the technologies (e.g. operating systems, protocols, applications) known to be used by and against the DoD are a focus of this CNA capability.  It is also critical to account for other technologies that may not be officially used or widespread in their use (e.g. commercial wireless, applications) as these can be integrated with DoD purchases of commercial equipment and software. This CNO research identifies, develops, and integrates these current and next-generation technologies, processes, procedures, and functionalities into the Threat CNO Teams suite of threat CNO capabilities. PEO STRI is seeking experienced contractors who can provide the unique services stated in this RFI.

Subject to program requirements, the Government intends to negotiate and award two small business set-aside indefinite delivery contracts within one year after the required response date to this announcement, but reserves the right to award up to two additional small business set-aside indefinite delivery contracts (a maximum total of four contracts).  Each contract will have a base period, not to exceed one year, and four option periods, not to exceed one year each.  The amount of work in each contract period will not exceed $500,000 ($2,500,000 total per contract).  However, an option period may be exercised at the Governments sole discretion when the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  Furthermore, any unused capacity may be rolled over to the next contract period at the Governments sole discretion.  Yearly rate schedules with annual cost adjustment will be negotiated for the contracts.  On each individual contract, the first years rate schedule shall become effective the day of contract award, and shall be in effect for 1 year from contract award.  Subsequent rate schedules shall become effective on the yearly anniversary dates from contract award.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm fixed-price task orders, not to exceed the contract amount.  The Contracting Officer will consider the following and other relevant factors in deciding which Contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the task order in the required time, uniquely specialized experience, geographic location, and equitable distribution of work among Contractors.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 and supplements thereto.

<DESC>The Product Manager Sensors and Lasers, located at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, is conducting a market survey for JETS-TLDS.  JETS will consist of the TLDS and the Target Effects Coordination System (TECS).  TLDS will provide the ability to acquire targets (surveillance); accurately locate targets (determine highly accurate grid coordinates); digitally communicate target data to TECS; and laser designate targets for attack by Laser Guided Weapons (LGW).  TLDS will transmit target data to the TECS, which will allow the operator to digitally communicate the data with fire support, close air support, command and control networks and targeting control systems in order to submit requests for ground fires, close air support, and navel fires. The subject of this market survey is only TLDS.<BR><BR>Sources within the United States are sought for innovative and light-weight solutions for hand-held operational systems in support to the TLDS program.  This announcement is issued for informational planning purposes only.  Submitting information for this announcement is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated.<BR><BR>	As currently conceived the TLDS program will begin with technology/prototype development in FY 2010, engineering and manufacturing development in FY 2012-14 and resulting in the production and fielding of the first increment in FY 2014 or FY 2015.  <BR><BR>	The primary TLDS capability requirements are; provide a reduction in hardware weight from current similar systems;  provide a highly accurate target location capability, and achieve connectivity for targeting effects coordination systems.  In support to the over-all JETS requirement, total targeted weight for all hardware shall be at or under a total system weight of seventeen, 17 pounds with all supporting items including power sources. Key TLDS objectives are shown, in summary in the following Exhibit.  <BR><BR>Exhibit: Target Location/Designation System (TLDS) Objective [Attribute, Desired Capability]: Target Identification (ID) Range, Day/Night, Greater than 8km/4km; Target Location Error (TLE), Less than 10 meters at 10km; Range Finder Range, Greater than 10km; Infrared (IR) Marker, Greater than 4km @ night; Image capture, Consistent with system optics; Laser Spot Tracker, Greater than 8km; Designator - Stationary or Moving, Greater than 8km using NATO standard coding schemes; TLDS System Weight, Less than 7 lbs for target location module, Less than 5 lbs for designation module; Total TLDS Weight, Less than 17 lbs (including tripod, batteries and cables)<BR><BR>Responses to this RFI should describe how the respondent would propose to develop a TLDS solution.  Specifically, responses should indicate the level of performance the respondents system can achieve in terms of the TLDS desired capabilities; propose threshold and objective levels; discuss tradeoffs that will be necessary; discuss when or how long it might take to achieve each TLDS desired capability; and, discuss what levels of teaming might be undertaken to meet the objectives.  Responses should include development and production cost; non-recurring Government and contractor cost share in Research and Development and Production phases.  Discussions should focus on meeting the TLDS requirements for a highly accurate target location and joint digital communication capability where the first TLDS increment will communicate and provide target location data to existing systems that do calls for fire or air support (e.g., Army PFED, Marine Corps THLDS, and Air Force TACP CAS.).  It should be noted that TLDS will not deliver a communications subsystem, but will rely on current or future communication connections to order to complete inter-operability requirements. <BR><BR>Instructions and response guidlines: <BR>	This market survey is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Quote, or a Request for Proposal, and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the U.S. Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Responses are limited to a total of 40 pages for information you deem relevant to the above TLDS information and must be completed in Microsoft Word format.  Page size must be 8.5 x 11, font must be 12 point or larger, and margins must be at least 1 inch.  Both sides of the paper may be used.  Each page side is counted unless blank.  In a separate document, limited to 5 pages, please briefly describe your company, your services, history, ownership, financial information, and business size.  Supplemental service brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications and capabilities may not be submitted.  PM SSL appreciates your response, and it will be used solely by the PM SSL as market research, and we will not divulge individual responses outside of the Government.  An information summary list giving contact information for all responses will be provided to each respondent. This is not a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract as a result of this notice or to pay for any information received.  <BR><BR>Contact Information: <BR>	Clarification questions must be received via e-mail by 10:00 a.m. on June 8, 2009, with clarifications returned to all responders on June 15, 2009.  Responses must be submitted via e-mail by 3:00 pm on Tuesday, June 30, 2009.  Clarification questions shall be e-mailed to foster.g.nickerson@us.army.mil, and the clarification subject line is to be Clarification Request for JETS-TLDS RFI.  Responses to the RFI shall be e-mailed to foster.g.nickerson@us.army.mil and the subject line is to be Response for JETS-TLDS RFI.  Areas where a source does not have prior experience should be annotated as such.  The government reserves the right to conduct vendor oral capabilities discussions or demonstrations to be scheduled at a later date.  Point of Contact is Foster G.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
and
SPECIFICATION
for
United States Coast Guard
Terma Frequency- Diversity Radar

Start Date:    Award of Contract
Completion Date:   NLT Three (3) Months from Start Date

1.0	 INTRODUCTION

The Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) Portsmouth, VA desires to purchase a Terma Scanter 2001 Dual-Redundant X-band transceiver radar system for integration into C2CENs Command Center Integrated Systems (CCIS) baseline system in order to better support fielded Terma radars. The Terma radar is a sensor used in the Ports and Waterways Safety System (PAWSS), Vessel Traffic Service (VTS), and Hawkeye port security systems. From a port safety and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) standpoint, it is imperative that fielded Terma radars are operational on a 24/7 basis. Therefore, routine maintenance, software upgrades, and security patches must first be tested on an identical non-operational baseline system before implementation on operational Terma radars. The newly procured Terma radar will also be used in the development and evaluation of future port security projects.


2.0	 BACKGROUND

2.1  Ports and Waterways Safety System (PAWSS)
The Ports and Waterways Safety System (PAWSS) was established to meet the goals set forth under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA), Title 33 USC 1221.  Under this provision the Coast Guard has a statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and environmental protection of U.S. ports and waterways. The PWSA authorizes the Coast Guard to "...establish, operate and maintain vessel traffic services in ports and waterways subject to congestion."  The purpose of the act was to establish good order and predictability on United States waterways by implementing fundamental waterways management practices.
PAWSS is deployed in nine ports: New York, Houston/Galveston TX, Lower Mississippi River (New Orleans, LA), Sault Ste Marie MI, Berwick Bay (Morgan City, LA), Prince William Sound (Valdez, AK),  San Francisco CA, Puget Sound (Seattle, WA), and Port Arthur TX.   The PAWSS project was acquired through a Congressionally Mandated System to modernize Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) through the use of commercially available technology including Automatic Identification System (AIS), Radars, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV), and voice communications. 
PAWSS is a Vessel Traffic Service navigation information system that is based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products consisting of sensors, communications, and decision support equipment.  PAWSS is deployed in a number of coastal locations throughout the U.S. and allows the Coast Guard to propagate important navigation information to mariners, thereby reducing collisions, groundings, and facilitates the safe and efficient transit of vessel traffic. The system compresses radar, VHF-FM voice, AIS, and video from remote sites into commercial leased land lines or microwaves and sends the information to a central Vessel Traffic Center (VTC).
2.2	Terma Frequency Diversity Radar System 
C2CEN chose the Terma radar system based on its superior performance and features; it is a highly sensitive and high-resolution radar system, tailored for use where requirements to interference rejection, signal processing and resistance to a tough environment are necessary parameters to maintain continuous radar coverage.  Terma radars are used extensively throughout the PAWSS system, including remote sites in Alaska which are accessible only by helicopter. It is therefore imperative that C2CEN have an identical radar system on our support baseline in order to test maintenance and upgrade procedures prior to attempting field implementation.
Terma North America Inc. has over 50 years of experience within the radar market and has supplied the Coast Guard with radar sensor solutions since the inception of the PAWSS and VTS systems. 

3.0  SCOPE
	
3.1	Radar System and Installation
The Contractor is responsible for installation and setting to work (STW) of the radar sensor system. Only Terma-qualified technicians will be authorized to perform the installation. U. S. Coast Guard C2CEN will support the installation task with at least one technically competent person and one person acquainted with local rules and regulations regarding electrical installations. Expenses related to crane hiring and hoisting of the antenna are not included. If requested by the COTR, the Contractor shall provide drawings showing the footprint of the antenna in order to facilitate mounting.  Installation site is at the Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), 4000 Coast Guard Blvd., Portsmouth, VA 23703


3.1.1 Integration and Fine Tuning at Site (C2CEN Portsmouth, VA)
           The Contractor is responsible for onsite integration of the radar sensor system with C2CENs baseline system as well as fine-tuning of radar site profiles.  This activity includes observation of clutter suppression and small target detection using test target and/or targets of opportunity. Fine-tuning of radar system is site dependent (antenna height, weather conditions, etc.) and may result in special settings or profiles for best possible performance against small targets.

	          3.2.2  Factory Acceptance Test (FAT)
	         C2CEN representatives will witness and verify the FAT. The FAT test results will be accepted as part of the documentation package.

	3.2  Terma Factory-Certified Training
	Technical training by Terma representatives will be performed for C2CEN support technicians. The training enables the technicians to assist in installation, make on site fault analysis and effect system repair. The technical training shall be carried out in conjunction with the FAT.  Technician training shall be completed in a 5-day course.

	3.3 Spare Parts Kit
	A spare parts kit is also included in this procurement in order to facilitate troubleshooting and repair efforts in the event of a Terma radar system failure. The contents of the spare parts kit is provided in the table below.

5.0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

      5.1 System Architecture
	
      DHS Enterprise Architecture Compliance
All solutions and services shall meet DHS and USCG Enterprise Architecture policies, standards, and procedures. Specifically, the contractor shall comply with the following Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture (HLS EA) and Coast Guard Enterprise Architecture (CGEA) requirements:
	All developed solutions and requirements shall be compliant with the HLS EA and CGEA.
	All IT hardware or software shall be compliant with the HLS EA Technical Reference Model (TRM) Standards and Products Profile. 
	All data assets, information exchanges and data standards, whether adopted or developed, shall be submitted to the DHS Enterprise Data Management Office (EDMO) for review and insertion into the DHS Data Reference Model.
	In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandates, all network hardware shall be IPv6 compatible without modification, upgrade, or replacement.
	All Information Technology assets being developed, procured, or acquired shall be IPv6 capable.

5.2 Radar System

Required technical specifications for the Radar Sensor Systems include:
	Dual Redundant X-Band Transceiver with Frequency Diversity. 
	21ft High Gain Slotted Waveguide antenna, fan beam radiation pattern, horizontal polarization.
	Antenna Control Unit, ACU, 4kW, 3-phase mains power supply. 
	Frequency Diversity (FD) processing to de-correlate sea clutter, reduce small target fluctuation, thereby improving the long-range detection. 
	Auto-Adaptive Sensitivity Control (ASC) to provide automatic two-dimensional STC, eliminating the need for operator setting of the radar during normal operation.
	Pulse-to-pulse integration to improve signal-to-noise ration for improved small target detection. 
	Digital FTC and sweep-to-sweep correlation. 
	Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), Pulse Width (PW) and random PRF stagger.

Although it is possible for other radar systems to meet these technical requirements, it is imperative that C2CEN procures a Terma system since that is the brand currently installed at PAWSS sites. Testing and troubleshooting on a similar radar is meaningless.
5.3 Training 
	C2CEN support technicians must be trained by Terma factory-certified technicians. This is necessary due to the fact that only Terma-certified technicians are authorized to service fielded radar systems. Any work performed on operational field units by uncertified technicians could void product warranties and service agreements.  Technician training shall be completed in a 5-day course.
5.4 Installation
Radar system installation, testing, acceptance, and on-site radar optimization must be performed by Terma factory representatives.  Installation site is Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), 4000 Coast Guard Blvd., Portsmouth, VA 23703

<DESC><p>The Government intends to award a sole source contract to JP Morgan Chase. JP Morgan Chase owns the custom design configured system to process paper filings and this custom design has already been paid for. The reason for the Sole Source is: It would not be cost effective to pay for the custom design again when PBGC is expecting fewer than 1,000 paper filings over the next five years (most filings are now received electronically).
<p>Description of Supplies/Services.<br />This contract is to provide banking, lockbox and data capture services for the PBGC. All defined benefit pension plans covered by Title IV of ERISA are required to file premium data and payments annually with the PBGC. Plans may submit checks, paper filings and correspondence to PBGC's financial lockbox via the U.S. mail, delivery service, courier, etc. Non-financial correspondence is submitted to the correspondence lockbox. Electronic payments are also made directly to PBGC's account. PBGC downloads electronic payment data, from the bank. PBGC requires the filing information received from the lockboxes be converted to an electronic format for processing purposes. The period of performance is from 10/01/2009 to 09/30/2014. The contract value is estimated at: $955,000.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested companies may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 10:00 a.m. (EST) on June 2, 2009. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to kvalevog.fiorela@pbgc.gov.</p>
<p>No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to award on a sole source basis a contract, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to provide for continuity of services and support the transition to a new competitive award currently being worked for Region 1 local telecommunications services.  Proposals are currently being evaluated for awarded for services in Massachusetts.   The region currently has the Metropolitan Area Acquisition contract for its local telecommunications services which is held by Verizon.  The contract was awarded in 2001 and is currently on a twelve month extension and is due to expire July of 2009.   The region is currently competing for these services under the recently awarded LSA contract which encompass all Massachusetts telecom services.  

As a the incumbent contractor, Verizon is the sole contractor capable of providing continuity of services through the period leading to a follow-on effort without major disruption, loss of functionality and/or features, degradation of services and significant overall costs impact to the federal agencies serviced by this contract.  This action effects approximately 12,000 circuits.  A laps in service will have an immediate detrimental effect on the ability of the General Services Administration to provide telecommunication services to federal agencies in the New England region.  Virtually all the federal agencies in New England region would loose telecommunications service if this contract ends before services are transitioned to the new Local Services Contract.  This contract will provide a bridge while the competitive acquisition is finalized and services can be transitioned to the new contract.  This sole source bridge contract extension is to allow for time to transition to the region 1 Local Services Contract.  Services will be mirrored on the bridge award to provide for transition to the Local Services Contract.  The Statutory Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.  2304(d)(1)(B).   The proposed bridge contract extension period of performance will be from August 1, 2009 through January 1, 2010.  This six month bridge contract extension will continue to provide minimum services that are currently provided for the requiring agencies.

<CONTACT>Alisa C. Murray, (251) 441-5578

<a href="mailto:alisa.c.murray@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Columbus, Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for.  The contractor will: set stop logs, dewater, inspect, repair and repaint miter gates as necessary. Inspect, replace or repair as necessary the cathodic protection systems, grease lines, gate timbers, steel, and seals, etc. at Coffeeville Lock. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, and hydraulic systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract.<BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:   1) A detailed scope of work cannot be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, paint miter gates and inspection.   2)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR>

<DESC>FBO Special NoticeThis is not a request for proposal or a request for quote.  There is no solicitation document available.  This is a notice of intent of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) to negotiate a sole source contract with Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT), for software and associated maintenance for VERITAS software.   Software maintenance includes reasonable technical support and periodic updates/releases to the software.  VERITAS is available on SEWP, however, it will be acquired from Northrop Grumman I.T., Inc. via the AACES Prime Vendor Contract V200P-909.  AITC has an existing VERITAS licensing agreement through NGIT for all VERITAS products with terms and conditions the AITC needs for its disaster recovery/continuity of business program operations.  It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the products through this vehicle to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and maintenance, and to take advantage of administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor.  The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal government and the price is fair and reasonable.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures.  Please reply no later than May 31, 2009 to Sylvia Thomas at (512) 326-6877.

<DESC>The VA Heartland Network 15 has an urgent requirement to establish a short term 6 month (with the option to extend an additional six months if necessary) interim contract while it works on a long term contract to provide on-site dialysis services for the VA Columbia, MO.  The interim contract is essential for continuity of health care to eligible veterans and is critical to support the VA mission.  The current contract with Dialysis Clinic, Inc. expires May 21, 2009.  Their contract performance is rated outstanding and they have agreed to provide continued services under an interim contract at no change to the previous contract rates for a period of six months or longer if necessary.   The interim contract is important to provide on-site dialysis services for the in-house dialysis department at Columbia, MO.  If the VA does not have a contract to provide these services, veterans will not be able to receive the necessary dialysis treatments.  This will have health implications for veterans as well as significant financial implications for the VA.  It will take the VA several months to solicit and award a long term contract.  Information regarding estimated quantities and types of procedures for the new long term contract are being established and provided to the contracting office.  It is expected that there will not be major change to the previous estimates and types of procedures required.  The interim contract will help to establish accurate estimates and procedures necessary for a competitive bid process.

<DESC>QUESTIONS & ANSWERS REGARDING SOLICITATION VA-255-09-RP-0296PROJECT 657A5-08-124 FCA UPGRADE EMERGENCY POWER AT MARION, IL, VAMCNOTE TO POTENTIAL OFFERORS: This document is included with this Special Notice for informational purposes only. The following questions have been received, and the answers are provided herein. These questions & answers are for technical clarification purposes only. These answers do not involve any change to the terms & conditions and/or plans & specifications of this solicitation. This information is strictly for the purpose of helping potential offerors interpret the intent of the previously issued solicitation. 1. 	QUESTION:  	Is the existing roofing on Bldg 47 still under warranty? If so, can the contractor who installed it be identified?  	ANSWER: 	Due to the age of the existing asphalt/pea gravel roof, the roof is not under warranty, and the identity of the original contractor cannot be determined. 2. 	QUESTION:  	Fuel lines for the generator day tanks in building 47 show they are to be capped off inside the building. Drawings indicate no further work to be accomplished with the tanks. At a site visit, there was an apparent mention of some additional work related to this. Is there additional work required at the tanks, or is this being accomplished by other means? 	ANSWER: 	The scope of work for this contract requires all of the lines to be capped on the inside of the building on the floor closest to the wall. No additional work beyond this has been identified. 3. QUESTION:  	At a site visit, a comment was made regarding asbestos removal of 9"x9" floor tile in the electrical closets. It is noted that there are no details, notes, or specifications regarding asbestos abatement. Can clarification be provided? 	ANSWER: 	If the contractor decides to remove any asbestos floor tile, they will be responsible for subcontracting to a qualified source to do such work. However, it should be noted that in the electrical closet there is a space where the contractor can drill right through without having to make contact with the existing asbestos floor tile. 4. 	QUESTION:  	It has been noted that in drawing file "S02. Drawing 05 E000.pdf" that under the notes for "Class II Infection Control Precautions:" at note #9, it states, "Ceramic Block Walls Surrounding Panels are Lead-Containing. Follow OSHA Lead in Construction Standards. Collect Lead Wipes at Conclusion Of Work to Insure no Lead Dust Remains." It is noted that there is no specification section detailing lead remediation, if needed. It is also noted that the solicitation, plans, & specifications contained no lead report. Is this an additional requirement, could you provide clarification regarding this matter? 	ANSWER: 	This is not a specific remediation requirement. This is a standard construction work site safety & cleanliness requirement to make sure that any lead containing dust generated by construction activities is not permitted to spread about the facility, or remain left behind in the area of the construction. The contractor is required to control the dust emissions and properly clean up the work place, so no dangerous waste products are left behind. As noted above, these questions & answers are provided for technical clarification purposes, and do not change any of the terms & conditions of the subject solicitation. (END OF Q&A DOCUMENT)

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-98-H-5015 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC>Deteriorated Roof Leaks - - - S O W
The existing roofs of the cafeteria have developed numerous cracks which constanly leak and damage occupied spaces below.  These are areas on the roof where water migrates to the edge of the roof at the parapet wall creating bubbles.  The surface aggregate of both roofs has washed away and crickets have not been properly installed to direct water to scuppers.  The existing parapet metal caps are not properly secured and sealed.  In some areas the metal caps have been screwed to substrate hindering expansion and contraction movement.  Numerous attempts were made to correct leaking probelms without success.
Recommendations:
1.  Remove the existing roofing material, insulation, flashing, counter flashing and parapet caps.
2.  Install new mineral board and rigid insulation of R38.  Provide tapered insulation to provide positive drainage to scuppers.  Install new single ply as follows: approximately 25,000 SF Energy Star high reflectance and high emissivity, scrim-reinforced, thermiplastic ployolefin (TPO) .60 inch nominal thickness.  Provide tapered insulation to achieve positive slope to perimeter gutters.  Remove and replace all flashing and counter-flashing in teh affected areas (12" wide x 1,1130' long).  All work to be accomplished in accordance with the NRCA.  Provide roofing manufacturer's standards 20 year warranty.
3.  Provide flashing and counter flashing at the perimeter of the roof.  Flashing, as recommended by roofing manufacturer, to extend on the side and over the paraper walls.  Install snap-on pre-finished metal cap.
4.  Provide control and expansion joints whre required.  
5.  Wind roof design (150)  shall meet applicable local and national codes.  

Roof area is approsimately 25,000 SF

<DESC>Title:
Scorecard and Internal Controls Document Search / Research Assistance

Description:
Provide Information and Documentation of Acquisition Management Leading Practices for Internal Scorecard Development, Internal Process Plan (IPP) Revision, and WO Review Process Update Project

Period of Performance:
Part A: July 1, 2009 through July 31, 2009
Part B: To Be Determined, at governments option

Type of Task:
Part A: Fixed Price
Part B: Fixed Price

Proposal Due Date:
June 11, 2009

Index: 
Background:	1
Project:	1
Deliverables:	2
Government Resources:	3
Consultant Proposals:	3
Travel:	4

Background:  The USDA Forest Service (FS) Acquisition Management (AQM) staff is undertaking a 30-month change management program that consists of multiple projects.  Project goals include improving efficiency, accountability, and communications.   One of the projects includes the following tasks: (1) creation of a scorecard for evaluating agency AQM performance across operating units, to be followed by (2) revision of the agency Internal Process Plans (IPP) that AQM units at Regions and Stations follow and (3) an update of the existing Washington Office (WO) review processes used to ensure that IPPs and federal and agency policy are being followed.   The AQM function at the Forest Service includes procurement, purchase card management, emergency incident (e.g. fire, hurricane) procurement, grants and agreements, real property management (including quarters management and leasing), and personal property management.  The projects described above will cover all AQM functional areas.  It is the teams intent to accomplish most of the work in-house.

Project:  Consultant support is requested to provide information on current government and private sector practices, with a focus on other federal agencies with similar AQM functions, for all three project tasks enumerated above.  Examples of information that the Forest Service requests includes:

	Scorecards in place at other federal agencies for AQM function(s) (or the private sector equivalent to a scorecard / dashboard), including information on purpose / goals, frequency, and use from an internal controls perspective.  Describe how programs are tying their scorecard to the OMB Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), if applicable.

	Internal Process Plans in place at other federal agencies for AQM function(s) (or the private sector equivalent), including information on success of IPPs in ensuring accountability, relationship of IPPs to an agencys Internal Controls environment, and relationship of IPPs to OMB Circular A-123.


	Documentation of effective internal (agency) reviews of AQM functions in accordance with IPPs (or the private sector equivalent), including internal review processes, teams, frequency of review and follow-up, and relationship of IPPs to review findings.

The FS recognizes that many best practices exist in the private sector.  However, these organizations do not operate in the same regulatory or structural environment in which government agencies do.  Therefore, the majority of resources provided by the consultant in response to this request should be from the public sector.  Public sector resources provided should be a mix of Department of Defense and federal civilian agencies with a preference toward similar land management agencies.  At least 1 example from a private sector organization with similar functions is also required.  

Deliverables:  
Part A:  Fixed Price.  The consultant deliverable will include documentation of at least four (4) examples of scorecards, IPPs, and internal AQM reviews that include the following AQM functional areas: procurement, grants and agreements, and property management (including real property management, personal property management, and leasing).  Therefore, at a minimum, twelve (12) documents are required.  If a document includes only procurement, for example, it would count towards the procurement total of 4 (the consultant would need to identify other documents to meet the requirements for the other functional areas).  At least 2 of the 4 examples must be from the federal government, and at least 1 must be from the private sector.  Documentation should be provided electronically, if possible, and should be submitted to the client as it is located (not in a single package at the end of the project).

The consultant will prepare a final deliverable in the form of a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, which shall include the following information: a concise description of documentation provided that includes a relative comparison of the documents by type and functional area(s) and identifies pros and cons associated with each agencys approach.  Presentation should include analysis, findings and recommendations (as described in the Project section of this SOW).  

Consultant will be required to attend an in-person meeting for 1 day (location TBD) to share findings with the FS project team. 

Part B.  Fixed Price.  Additional analysis may be required based on findings and recommendations from Part A.  Deliverables for Part B are to be determined (TBD), if and when the government decides that additional consultant services are required.  

Government Resources:  Resources the FS will provide to the consultant upon award of the contract include existing Region and Station AQM IPPs and past WO review reports that provide an example of the current internal AQM review processes and documentation.  The FS does not currently have an AQM scorecard or performance metrics. 

Consultant Proposals:  The proposals shall be submitted to the designated Contracting Officer: cost and technical.  Consultant proposals will be evaluated based on cost, technical approach / methodology, and past performance.  Submission of proposals in electronic format is preferred.

Cost:  Offers for this project shall include Part A (required, firm fixed price) and Part B (optional, time and materials).  Part B cost proposals should include labor rates only.  Travel costs will be reimbursed separately, and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) in effect at the time of travel.  See the travel section below for additional information.  Cost proposal need not include the estimated cost of travel for the proposed presenter of project findings (per deliverable section above).  
 
Technical Proposal:  The consultant should describe their planned approach / methodology for accomplishing the project, including describing any resources to which they have access that would result in a better final deliverable (e.g. knowledge databases, past client deliverables, etc).  Technical proposal should focus on Part A response.  Technical proposals must also include a section on past performance.   

	Past Performance:  The successful consultant will have prior experience with developing scorecards, IPPs, and internal review plans for acquisition management organizations at other federal agencies.  Provide at least 3 summaries of past performance, including project reference contact information, in your response.  

Technical proposals should be no longer than 10 pages, single spaced, 12-point Arial font.  Proposals are due by the due date listed on the first page of this SOW, and should be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer listed below in the Points of Contact section.

Travel:  Any contractor travel required and funded by the Government in support of this contract shall be authorized by the COR in advance of the scheduled trip.  Travel costs will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) in effect at the time of travel.

For each trip, the contractor will submit to the COR a Request for Travel Authorization (RTA).  The RTA will identify the purpose of the travel, an agenda for what is to be accomplished by the travel, and a detailed estimate of the costs to be incurred.  Unauthorized travel or travel not coordinated with the Forest Service COR may not be reimbursed.

<DESC>Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for projects to explore the further development of efficient, high temperature SiC power electronics to be used in military vehicles that encompass hybrid electric mobility and power generation systems.  The government desires SiC power electronics that can operate with coolant inlet temperatures at 100C or higher.   Increased coolant temperatures increase cooling efficiency and allow for reduced cooling system size.  The power electronics developed must use the SiC power semiconductors to maximize efficiency, power density (kW/liter) and specific power (kW/kg), while maintaining or improving power converter reliability.  The corresponding reductions in size and weight for the cooling system and the electrical power converter, along with increased cooling efficiency and power conversion efficiency will make vehicle electric and hybrid electric power systems smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient.<BR><BR>Estimated Maximum Government funding available for Topic #20 is $12.15M.  The Government reserves the right to award part or all of an offerors proposal resulting in one or multiple contracts (for various amounts, but the sum of multiple contract awards shall not exceed $12.15M) that may address one or more or all of the Power Converter Types listed in the attachment at subparagraph 2.b of the Description section.<BR><BR>Potential offerors should access the full topic description by clicking the link below or copying and pasting the following URL:<BR><BR>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/topics.htm <BR><BR>Solicitation terms and conditions and proposal submission instructions for this Broad Agency Anouncement can be accessed by copying and pasting the following URL:<BR><BR>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/05RBAA1.htm<BR><BR>Special Proposal Instructions:<BR><BR>All proposals must be submitted by 3:00 PM EST on July 10, 2009 using the ASFI Bid Response System (BRS), which may be accessed at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                Commandant (G-A)

<DESC><p>The following questions were asked this morning.&nbsp; First the question then the answer.</p>
<p>Q1) My team advises that the tension of the cables will eventually warp the birch plywood panels. The panels need to be mounted with more secure fastening cleats instead of the hardware specified in the SOW.
<p>A1) The 3/4 panels will be sufficient. They will be secured to the walls and will not warp.</p>
<p>Q2) Auditorium, aluminum typography panels, will the blue acrylic be opaque or transparent? The transparent acrylic is more expensive.</p>
<p>A2) Transparent</p>
<p>Q3) Auditorium, my team advises that we use a more secure mounting system for the 12 large panels. Is that acceptable?</p>
<p>A3) We will need to be able to pull and move easily so pinch cleats (as in our original SOW and drawings) are appropriate.</p>
<p>Q4) Auditorium, back wall, please confirm that the cables will go from floor-to-ceiling. Also, can you please tell me the approximate height of the ceiling?</p>
<p>A4) Everything was specified in the drawings in the SOW.</p>
<p>Q5) Based on our site visit, we are bidding the project with "C" prints on all the back panels, rather than plain black. Is that appropriate?</p>
<p>A5) Where and what are they asking about? There are several areas.</p>
<p>Q6) Are we required to hang the envelopes at the time of installation? If so, will the AFB provide a layout? Additional days of installation will be required if there is no layout and the AFB opts to "art direct" placement of envelopes at the time of installation.</p>
<p>A6) They will be required to hang them. Even number on each side as specified in the drawings and SOW.</p>

<DESC><p>1. The RFQ had mentioned some "free-standing" sections, yet at the walk through nothing was mentioned. Are we to follow the RFQ or follow the discussions at the walk-through with regards to what and how much is being stored?<br />Follow the walk through
<p>2. Is Fire-Retardant decking a requirement? <br />yes</p>
<p>3. The layout suggested in the RFQ: Is this a "must" or can we design a system that will be more functional within the space, yet still hold the required amount of storage?<br />The layout in the RFQ is not a must</p>
<p>4. What is the minimum quantity and aisle width requirement?<br />24"</p>
<p>5. In the original RFQ, it called for "steel" end panels. Is this still a requirement?<br />yes</p>
<p>6. Please confirm that you're need a minimum of 1,400 deployment sets to be stored within the system. <br />yes</p>
<p>7. Is aesthetics secondary to functionality?<br />yes</p>
<p>8. Is L&amp;T shelving specifically required or can we propose an equally functional product?<br />Yes</p>
<p>9. Will product specifications need to be submitted with the bid response? <br />yes</p>
<p>10. The specifications you sent called for "LT shelving Mobile" This would seem to be "L&amp;T" four post style shelving units manufactured by Tennsco Corporation of that designation. During the site visit there were representatives from Spacesaver, Tab Products, Indoff and other companies Only some of these companies would have access to "LT". My company represents the Borroughs Corporation which manufactures shelving that is like the "LT" shelving. Are you specifying a manufacturer or a style of shelving (In this case 4 Post Shelving).<br /><br />No</p>
<p>11. The product you plan on storing included a KIT made up of a plastic case combined with a duffle bag. My measurements were as follows:</p>
<p>A - If the Case was set flat on its side with the Duffle Bag placed on top - it measured 19" wide x 24" deep x 24" High<br />B- If the Case was set on end with the Duffle Bag placed to the side - the two items took up a footprint that was 24" wide x 24" deep x 19" H.<br /><br />Question: Are the items inside the duffle bag able to be compressed so that the duffle bag might take up less space that the measurements would indicate?<br />No</p>
<p>12. Based on my preliminary layout -your requirement for 2600 slots is probably more that the space will allow for once work areas, the obstruction that building columns represent and the aisles are considered. <br />If you take the total area of the room and deduct the two work areas and then calculate the cubic space that a 7' 6" High footprint will make up - The total cubic space will allow for 2600 slots with no aisles and no consideration to the obstructions such as the building columns, ramp requirements, etc. will add up and with out considering the space that the shelving itself will take up. Your associate indicated that 2800 slots would be ideal. The area is simply not big enough. Please comment.<br />There will only be one work area, the yellow area toward the front was the first choice and the red area toward the back was the second choice.<br />I have a question regarding the clear coating sealant requirement. Would VCT floor covering or a high density finished decking system meet the end users requirement for the wood decking?<br />Yes</p>
<p>13. Where are the fixed carriages placed?<br />Next to the building columns and on the ends</p>
<p>14. Single or dual access?<br />Dual preferable</p>
<p>15. What do the kits (combination of the plastic case and duffle) being stored weigh?<br />Approximately 40 lb</p>
<p>16. Thickness of Deck - Do you require 5/8" or 3/4" thick plywood deck?</p>
<p>17. 18" Deep Shelving. Your original specifications called out for 48" x 18" x 88"H Units. These units are not ideal for storing your kits as shown to us on Friday. There is one part of the room that could accommodate 48" x 18" shelving units. Do you want these included in the design even though they might not handle the storage of your kits efficiently?<br />yes</p>

This noticeserves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will notbe issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed.1.	The quotes are due June 4, 2:30 PM and the parts are due June 15. That is only 11days. How many of those days will it take to make the award? a.	The delivery date will be revised to July 15, 20092.	We note in the solicitation that Items 6, 9, 10, 11 and 14 have been left out. Was this intentional or is something missing from the solicitation?a.	Nothing missing.  Parts not needed.3.	Has NASA ever ordered any of these Erector Set parts with this hole and/or slotpattern? If so, please provide details of that award?a.	Yes. The last set was fabricated in the 1960s.  No information found.4.	I am having trouble determining from your solicitation where the completed itemsare to be shipped.  Please clarifya.	Please Ship to NASA-Dryden Flight Research Center, Building 4876, Warehouse #6,Edwards, CA 935245.	Standard packaging and shipping is acceptablea.	Yes6.	Channels are FOB Origin or Destinationa.	RFQ requests all items be FOB Destination.7.	The drawing calls for powder coat and prepare surfaces for outdoor storage.Please elaborate on what is an acceptable preparation for outdoor storage. If we use apowder coat that is rated for outdoor use, is that sufficient to meet the outdoorstorage spec? If not, will shrink wrapping of the parts be sufficient? a.	Clean per best painting practices and powder coat Med Gray.8.	Since "Medium Gray" is the only callout for the color of the powder coat, is anymedium gray color acceptable?a.	Yes9.	Would customer accept epoxy coating rather than powder coat?  Or is powder coat ahard requirement?a.	Powder coast is a hard requirement.10.

To our knowledge, the hole/slot pattern is not already available.11.	I need to know the WEB THICKNESS, FLANGE THICKNESS/WIDTH, and if possibleWEIGHT/FT. to properly quote the right channel for this solicitation # NND09204576Q.a.	USE industrial standard for C channel.  First call out is the overall heightand the second is the weight per foot.12.	I am confused with the tolerance to use? The holes have both 3 place decimal aswell as fraction, the slots have 3 place decimal dimensions, and it will be expensive tohold +/- .001 especially on the A-36 channels. Is the tolerance required as specified?a.	Go by the decimal dimension and the associated tolerances.13.	As a few of the pieces are quite long for a waterjet, is it acceptable tofabricate the longer pieces in two parts and weld them together?a.	No cutting and welding of parts is acceptable.14.	Note 1 on the provided drawing calls out typical slot cutout every 12 inches. The drawing shows that the first slot cutout is centered 12" from one end.  On either a30" length or a 42" length, you are going to be left with one end having 6" from the slotcenter to the end of the plate.  Is this the intention or are slots to be located so thatthey are on 12" centers from each other and equidistant from either end?a.	Omit slot if it intrudes on the last set of holes.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 5/20/2009 Documents related to this procurementare available over the Internet.

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Two 110 kW electric boilers are located in the Food Service Bldg. P mechanical room.&nbsp; One of the two is on-line, functional and in good condition. There is no backup boiler currently. The other is&nbsp;old, corroded, disconnected from service and abandoned in the room. It is the intent of this project to remove the abandoned boiler from the room and replace it with a new 110 kW electric boiler. The new boiler is to be installed, piped and valved, power-wired and control-wired, such that either this boiler or the existing boiler can be chosen to operate while the other is reserved as a backup. The center will develop a schedule to alternate the operation of the two boilers to prevent extended water stagnation and mineral deposits in the boiler, pipes and valves.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp; </span></p>

Where can I obtain the FEMA fuel tank spec to ensure our FEMA specs are up to date?
 
Answer:  The generator shall be equipped with a UL142 double-walled sub-base and vented, integrated fuel tank of sufficient capacity as to hold a 12hr supply of fuel for the generator to which it is affixed.  This is different that the 24hr specification required in the continental US.  The tank must include two 4x10 .250 fork pockets spaced based on the generators center of gravity at not more than 77 inches apart.  Furthermore, the generator shall also be equipped with all lines and fittings necessary to properly connect the generator to the fuel tank, as well as hydraulic quick-disconnect couplers installed on both fuel supply and return lines to facilitate the use of external fuel caddies during maintenance operations.  A photo of a similar machine already on-hand is attached.
Q.  Are the generators both standbys or portable?
Answer: The word both in the question implies the request is for two generators; the request is for only a single machine.  The single generator being requested is a portable MQ Power brand 400kva generator with the specification outlined in the request.
Q.  Do they need transfer switches?
Answer: No
Q.  How much amperage feed into the building?
Answer: The amperage requirements are the amperage capabilities of the requested brand and model generator.  This question presumes the machine is being purchased for a specific building; it is not.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>Modification #001</p>
<p>Responses to questions submitted on 5/26/09.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a rail site near the plant so shipments can be delivered by rail?</p>
<p>Yes, there is a&nbsp;Union Pacific rail line within 100 yards of the plant.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;there is storage at the Nogales plant for less than 15,000 gallons.&nbsp; The plant will take deliveries in the range of 6,500 to 12,000 gallons at a time.&nbsp; Any rail car storage issue will be&nbsp;between vendor and Union Pacific.&nbsp; Vendor would still be required to unload and deliver product via truck.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Are you currently purchasing carbon?</p>
<p>IBWC&nbsp;is not purchasing glycerin at this time.&nbsp; It is being purchased by the construction manager as part of the Nogales plant start agreement.&nbsp; Once the facility is under IBWC's&nbsp;control, the agency&nbsp;will be required to provide the glycerin with&nbsp;agency&nbsp;funds.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Is this a new requirement?</p>
<p>Yes, this is&nbsp;a new requirement for the new Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant to be completed on or about 6/23/09.</p>

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:

The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:

52.212-1
52.212-3
52.212-4
52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3 and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a) (1) and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.232-33, 
52.217-5

NIST seeks to procure a renewal of the following Mercury software licenses that are used by the NIST Office of the Chief Information Officer, Applications Systems Division. These licenses comply with applicable standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended. NIST has already made a significant investment in the initial procurement of these licenses. If NIST were to replace the software licenses with a different type of licenses, NIST would also have to make an investment in new hardware and retrain its staff.  Also, it is not feasible to potentially change licenses for a particular use every year since it would cause disruption and isnt practical from an operational standpoint. Therefore, NIST is electing to renew its existing Mercury software licenses. Contract Line Item Numbers and associated quantities and descriptions of the license renewals can be found on the attached document

Note: The exiting license number for the above Contract Line Item Numbers is: 1033-5596-2640

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Background: Joint Publication 2-01.3 "Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for the Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (JIPB)" describes the JIPB process, which focuses on defining the battlespace environment, describing the battlespace's effects, evaluation of the threat, and determination of adversary courses of action (COA).</p>
<p>Research programs, such as the Automated Assistance with Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (A2IPB), have begun to provide software tools for organizing the vast quantity of information necessary to support the JIPB process. However, development of key IPB products is still a manual process, and there is a critical lack of software tools to support automated (or even semi-automated) development of the IPB key products.</p>
<p>There are a variety of technical disciplines that are applicable to information fusion research. Examples include: statistical based approaches, Bayesian belief networks; artificial neural systems; graph theory; knowledge based system technologies; fuzzy theory; hidden markov models; and Dempster-Shafer theory</p>
<p>Objective: The objective of this BAA is to solve information fusion technology problems rapidly, by developing software tools that provide computational techniques to support the analysis of identities, behaviors, intentions, capabilitiy, capacity, kinematics, activity level, and saliences. Examples of key IPB products include: Named Areas of Interest (NAI), Target Areas of Interest (TAI), Courses of Action (COA), Units, Infrastructure Areas (IA), Lines of Communication (LOC), Individuals, NAI Matrices, Target Value Matrices, LOC Matrices, and COA Matrices.</p>
<p>FY10 FOCUS AREA:</p>
<p>It is requested that white papers for FY 10 concentrate on the following area of the original objective: The objective of this BAA for FY 10 is to solve information fusion technology problems rapidly by developing software tools that provide computational techniques to support the analysis of saliences by focusing on the development of key IPB products that include: Named Areas of Interest (NAI), Target Areas of Interest (TAI), Courses of Action (COA), Units, Infrastructure Areas (IA), Lines of Communication (LOC), Individuals, NAI Matrices, Target Value Matrices, LOC Matrices, and COA Matrices.</p>

Task descriptions and associated technical elements provided are complete and in a logical sequence with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a final product that achieves the goal can be expected as a result of award. The white paper/proposal identifies major technical risks and planned mitigation efforts are clearly defined and feasible; (c) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the AFRL Mission - The potential contributions of the proposed effort with relevance to the national technology base will be evaluated. Specifically, AFRL's mission is to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. Air Force and prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use; (d) Offeror's Capabilities and/or Related Experience - The offeror's prior experience in similar efforts must clearly demonstrate an ability to deliver products that meet the proposed technical performance within the proposed budget and schedule. The proposed team's expertise to manage the cost and schedule will be evaluated. Similar efforts completed/ongoing by the offeror in this area are fully described including identification of other Government sponsors; (e) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition - The capability to transition the technology to the research, industrial, and operational military communities in such a way as to enhance U.S. defense, and the extent to which intellectual property rights limitations creates or may create a barrier to technology transition; and (f) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>Robert Denton<br />Telephone: (315) 330-7067<br />Email: Robert.Denton@rl.af.mil</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:</p>
<p>Susan Hunter<br />Building 15, Room 225<br />1864 Fourth Street<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130<br />FAX: (937) 225-5036; Comm: (937) 255-7754</p>

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) intends to issue a Solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOI) to U.S. Small Businesses for the development of prototype photovoltaic (PV) modules and pilot production. This LOI is in support of U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Solar America Initiative (SAI). Authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the SAI represents a significant enhancement of DOE's business strategy of partnering with the U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of PV system research and development (R&D) to meet aggressive cost and installed capacity goals. This Solicitation is targeted at innovative R&D on PV cell and module prototypes with demonstrated functionality in either large-area cell/module form or, preferably, prototypes produced in pilot-scale operations. The emphasis on proposed activities should be on the barriers to manufacturing scale-up and 2012 commercialization. The primary objective of this program is to shorten the timeline for companies to transition prototype and pre-commercial PV technologies into pilot and full-scale manufacture. Responders to this Solicitation are expected to focus their efforts on a limited number of high impact areas that lie on the critical path to scaling-up their technology to full manufacture. The minimum entrance criterion is demonstrated laboratory PV process technology (feedstock, wafers, cells or modules). The successful exit criterion is for prototype modules and pilot production demonstration >2MW/year. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that 6 to 10 subcontracts, up to $3M each, will be awarded as 18-month phased subcontracts. A Net Conference regarding the project is scheduled for Friday, March 6, 2009, 9:30 A.M. Mountain Time. The Solicitation will be available to view/download on February 17, 2009 from NREL's website at: http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html.

<a href="mailto:whitney.coleman-clark@faa.gov">whitney.coleman-clark@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Revision:  Solicitation/Contract No. 8186 is being revised as follow:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Headquarters, Washington, DC, contemplates the procurement of Rack Fabrication supplies in support of the FAA's National Rack Fabrication Project.  The desired delivery is FOB: Destination.  Address:  699174 Federal Aviation Admin, E OPS Ontario A/R/C (82CJ), 1130 S Archibald Ave, Ontario, CA 91761-7652.
The FAA's requirement is as identified in the attached Parts Listing, or Attachment 1.  Attachment 2 represents copies of the associated drawings applicable to the parts identified on the listing.  Attachment 3 is a copy of Questions & Answers generated during the initial issuance (original version) of this announcement.
Delivery/Period of Performance: To be cited on each individual order.   
To fulfill the Government's immediate need under this requirement, the FAA intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for a period of one year, with an option to extend the BPA for an additional year should it become necessary, while the acquisition for a permanent contract is put in place.  
A BPA is a simplified method of filling the Government's anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing charge accounts with qualified sources of supply.
A BPA is not a contract.  It is an understanding between the FAA and a vendor that allows the FAA to place future orders quickly.  Under a BPA, the FAA is not obligated to place any orders, nor the vendors obligated to accept them.  An enforceable contract exists only when the FAA places an order against the BPA and the vendor accepts it.      
The anticipated total ceiling amount under the BPA has been established at $300,000.00 annually, or $600,000.00 should it become necessary to exercise the option period.  
This acquisition is contemplated as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with the NAICS Code identified below.  
The NAICS Code under this acquisition is 332313, Plate Work Manufacturing, with a Small Business Standard Size of 500 employees.  Firms shall complete and submit the attached Business Declaration form with their reply.
Purpose of Announcement:  To solicit sources that would be interested in establishing a BPA under this requirement.  Interested vendors should submit to the Contracting Officer a statement of interest, along with a copy of their price list for the parts identified under Attachment 1 no later than 12:00 Noon, EST, 3 June 2009.  No further screening information request (SIR) or other postings will be issued as a result of this announcement.  The anticipated award date under this requirement is 10 June 2009.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) hereby issues this Request for Proposal (RFP) seeking a Contractor to provide technical support to Ugandan District Governments implementing the Northern Uganda Development of Enhanced Local Governance, Infrastructure and Livelihoods (NUDEIL) Program. The Contractor will act as an agent for USAID. The overall program has two sections: 1) a technical assistance contractor with an Architecture and Engineering sub-contractor and 2) a large sector assistance package that will use government systems for implementation. 

The services of the contractor will include: 
a) Development of memorandums of understanding with targeted District Governments, development of community and project prioritization criteria with USAID and the targeted District Governments;
b) Provision of engineering services to supervise and certify the construction and rehabilitation of small infrastructure by the targeted District Governments;
c) Provision of technical and equipment support as necessary to District Offices such as the financial management and engineering offices to ensure they comply with USAID regulations and have the capacity to implement infrastructure projects and make payments on finished NUDEIL projects; 
d) Development of a monitoring and evaluation system for NUDEIL in partnership with targeted local governments that aligns with USAID strategic objectives and the objectives of the Government of Ugandas (GOU) Peace, Reconciliation, and Development Plan (PRDP). 

All activities conducted under the NUDEIL contract will comply with the basic strategies of the program: to inject capital into the recovering rural communities of Northern Uganda; rehabilitate community infrastructure using labor intensive methods; and improve government service delivery and increase citizen confidence in government.

Please note that this Synopsis provides ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation will be forthcoming. All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address: Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />This Acquisition shall be competed as SMALL BUSINESS. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. A Small Business solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated total workload value of $400 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico). However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area if capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to as follows: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the Small Business pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $10 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3,000. The minimum guarantee for the Small Business contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB). <br /><br />Any entity may submit proposal(s) who qualifies for the Statement of Work in the Solicitation. The Awardees will make up the pool for each of the unrestricted and set-aside contract areas (HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business and unrestricted). There must be two or more awards to create each of the HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC><p>Document Type: Synopsis / Pre-solicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: W9126G-09-R-0101 (previously W9126G-09-R-0071)<br />Posted Date: April 30, 2009<br />Synopsis posted for: 15 days<br />Post solicitation no earlier than: May 15, 2009<br />Current Response Date: May 30, 2009<br />Classification Code: Y---Construction of Structures and Facilities<br />Set Aside: 8(a) Set Aside Pool of Contractors <br />NAICS Code: 236220 -Commercial &amp; Institutional Building Construction <br />Program Type: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)<br /><br />Contracting Office Address<br />US Army Engineer District, Fort Worth, ATTN: CESWT-CT (Karen Nelson), 819 Taylor Street Room 2A19, Fort Worth, TX 76102 <br /><br />Description <br />This is a special notice to inform the public of the use of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This Synopsis provides ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation will be forthcoming. All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address: Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />This Acquisition shall be competed as an 8 (a) SET ASIDE. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. An 8 (a) Set Aside solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated total workload value of $140 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico). However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area if capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to as follows: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the 8(a) Set Aside pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $15 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3,000. The minimum guarantee for the 8(a) Set Aside contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB). <br /><br />Any entity may submit proposal(s) who qualifies for the Statement of Work in the Solicitation. The Awardees will make up the pool for each of the unrestricted and set-aside contract areas (HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business and unrestricted). There must be two or more awards to create each of the HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

It is each prospective offeror's responsibility to check the below-listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation.

Capitol City Field Training Exercise Venue Description<BR>Train Derailment  Des Moines, IA      <BR>Hard economic times continue to trouble various industries throughout the country.  In the Midwest, various businesses search for ways to cut costs, due to falling profits. <BR>The railroad industry is particularly affected, squeezed by both rising fuel costs and agriculture-related companies reducing their delivery requests.  To survive economically, several rail shipping companies announce massive layoffs.  Iowa Interstate Railroad, Iowa Chicago and Eastern Railroad Corporation, Canadian National Railroad, and Union Pacific Railroad eliminate jobs for hundreds of engineers, mechanics, switchmen, and dispatchers.  <BR>Some railroad employees seek new work or leave for other opportunities.  Others continue to fight for their jobs protesting at each of the railroad companys corporate headquarters, as well as the Iowa Department of Transportation.  This leads to increased levels of violence and isolated clashes with police.  The different railroad companies also begin to report incidents of vandalism against their offices, equipment, and facilities.  Several small fires are set.  At other locations, glass windows are broken and rocks thrown.  At rural locations, switches and other sensitive equipment is damaged.  State and local law enforcement make a number of arrests, but their actions do not noticeably reduce the illegal acts against the rail system.<BR>Events reach a boiling point when a Acme Corp RR freight train is derailed in Polk County on 18 JUN 2008.  Unknown parties attach a portable derailing device to a section of track inside Des Moines.  A train carrying multiple toxic industrial chemicals, including chlorine, ammonium nitrate, phosgene, coal, and other harmful elements separates from the track and splits open in multiple locations.<BR>Several large chemical fires erupt from damaged rail cars and spread to both neighboring buildings and wooded areas.  Prevailing winds carry harmful chemicals through the air into several residential neighborhoods.  East High School quickly reports dozens of illnesses, many from attendees at a track and field sporting event.  Many families rush to area medical facilities such as the Iowa Methodist Medical Center, while others succumb to illness and require assistance from Emergency Medical Teams.  <BR>Polk County officials rapidly identify the derailment as a mass casualty event.  They recognize that the event exceeds the countys available resources, and ask for state assistance, including WMD Specialty Teams and the National Guards Civil Support Team.  Iowa Homeland Security further recognizes that state assets need to be augmented and releases multiple requests for assistance through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact.  This results in deployment of multiple CSTs from Region VII States, and the movement of the Nebraska CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP) to assist with urban search and rescue, medical triage, and decontamination of victims.<BR>The immediate public reaction to the explosions is panic.  Many area residents assume the event is a terrorist attack.  Others are concerned about the well-being of their families, some of whom live in the vicinity of the explosion.  Traffic rapidly becomes congested, particularly on Interstate 35 and 235.  Some individuals choose to leave town altogether, filling roads heading away from the capital.  Emergency responders from Jasper, Story, Dallas, and Warren Counties rush to provide immediate assistance and support live-saving operations.<BR>Area businesses activate their Continuity of Operations and evacuation plans to protect their employees.  Many government buildings are emptied, and employees encouraged to return to their homes until given further notice.  While in summer break, all area schools suspend ongoing activities and encourage parents to retrieve their children.<BR>Media reports begin pouring from the site of the incident.  Area radio and television stations have dispatched reporters to interview victims.  News helicopters hover above the accident site, beaming footage to networks for broadcast.  National media outlets pick up the story and carry the derailment as a lead item in their nightly broadcasts.<BR>Hours after the event, a robust Incident Command is established at the site of the derailment.  Police, fire, medical teams, and the National Guards Civil Support Team are all present, performing their jobs and rendering assistance.  The IC requests three Incident Management Teams (IMTs) to augment recovery efforts.  First responders concentrate on providing life-saving assistance first and foremost, rescuing victims of the train derailment and individuals who may be trapped in nearby businesses under piles of debris.  Other responsibilities quickly include:<BR>Victim decontamination<BR>Medical care for the injured<BR>Transportation of victims to area hospitals<BR>Containment of the incident site<BR>Establishing a security cordon around the immediate area<BR>Evacuating victims downwind of event<BR>Identification what hazardous materials have been released at the site <BR>Law enforcement agencies, including the Polk County Sheriffs Office, Des Moines Police, and representatives from FBI Region VII Field Offices begin their assessment of parties responsible for the event.  Evidence of the Train Derailer quickly strongly suggests that the event was an act of sabotage.  Law Enforcement begins to search the area for evidence and conduct research on probable suspects.<BR>Following a notional investigation, FBI officials identify the likely parties responsible for the derailment.  In a coordinated effort with county and state law enforcement, the FBI conducts a raid on the homes of the suspects.  Three individuals are taken into custody, all former employees of Union Pacific Railroad.  <BR>Approximately 96 hours after the initial derailment, the situation is Des Moines has been largely stabilized.  Over 200+ (500 possibly) victims have been transported to area hospitals.  Incoming CERFP and medical units have processed hundreds of individuals at the scene of the incident.  An Incident Command has been fully established, area evacuated and containment established.  Area fires are under control, although fires at the train site continue to smolder.  Civil Support Teams have worked with civilian HAZMAT personnel to identify which chemical agents have been released and represent a threat.  <BR>City, county, and state representatives hold a media press conference to announce the capture of those individuals responsible and to provide updated casualty / damage assessment figures.  Public protests against the railroad companies have largely ended and former employees disbanded.  <BR>Annex  2.
