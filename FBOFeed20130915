<DESC>The Department Of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract award on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) "Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" to West Publishing Corporation, P.O. Box 6292, Carol Stream, IL 60197-6292. The service is to provide continuous professional development and training in support of 25 attorneys and paralegals whose practice encompasses various areas of law in both federal and multiple state jurisdictions. PSC is U099, NAICS Code is 611699, and Size standard is $10 Million.
<p>The sole source determination is based upon West Publishing Corporation being the only source able to complete to provide continuous professional development and training in support of 25 attorneys and paralegals whose practice encompasses various areas of law in both federal and multiple state jurisdictions because it is the only contractor that offers training programs for new and emerging areas of law for 45 of the 50 (almost all) states as well as for territories such as Puerto Rico (where four DoDEA schools are located) that also offers comprehensive training in a substantial range of courses in legal areas unique to DoDEA, such as Education Law and Special Education Law, Federal Employment Law, Government Contracting, Freedom of Information Act, Government Benefits, and Intellectual Property. West LegalEdCenter is also the only source that offers a paralegal training program in addition to the attorney courses that would support the training needs of our non-attorney professionals, such as courses on case management, business skills, and legal writing in addition to the areas of subject matter expertise without having to procure a separate service.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals. Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses to this electronic notice must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on 23 September 2013. Responses may be submitted by E-mail to Matt Schulz: matthew.schulz@hq.dodea.edu</p>

Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of Defense directive that must be submitted annually for work actually performed. No report of any kind is required during the solicitation phase of the procurement, although the Offeror must price the CMR CLINS, agreeing to the delivery of the report pursuant to the award of the Purchase Order. The vendor may opt to provide pricing for the CMR CLINs or opt to complete the CMR Reporting at no cost to the Government. However; as a clear indication of the Offeror's intention, pricing must be represented with a numerical value ($0.00 if the Offeror opts to complete the reporting at no cost). The proposed price for the CMR Reporting fee will be included in the price evaluation. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the Contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>vi.	Background</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency 	and the primary Federal agency mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature 	and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, 	lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. conducting, supporting and making 	medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institute of 	Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) are a part of the National 	Institutes of Health (NIH), supporting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention 	of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; the training of basic and clinical 	scientists to carry out this research; and the dissemination of information on research 	progress in these diseases.</p>
<p>Currently, NIAMS has ongoing human clinical research projects in the Pediatric 	Translational Research Branch dealing with "the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation 	and its impact on structural remodeling of bone in spondyloarthritic diseases such as 	ankylosing spondylitis" and those of the Translational Autoinflammatory Disease 	Section. This type of research often requires identification and isolation of rare 	subpopulations, which can only be done with highly complex polychromatic labeling. A 	five-laser system including true UV can provide optimal light wavelengths allowing 	investigators to use novel fluorochromes and fluorescent protein reporters.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives:</span></strong></p>
<p>Because of the increasing interest in translational immunology and "bench-to-bedside" research involving clinical patients, NIAMS investigators now have the need for more complex sorting technology as well a higher degree of biosafety. Presently, the Flow Cytometry Section (FCS) in the Office of Science and Technology of NIAMS IRP operates and maintains three cell sorters: a BD FACSAria IIIu, a BD InFlux and Beckman Coulter MoFlo Legacy, which are actively used on a daily basis to support the NIAMS mission.

<p>Offerors must submit, as part of their proposal, the following: (1) Completed Price Proposal/Schedule (2) Completed copies of FAR 52.212-3, as well as DFARS 252.212-7000 or Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) record. ORCA is located at https://orca.bpn.gov. The provisions and clauses can be found at FAR website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil and DFARS website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vfdfara.htm (3) Exhibit 5, Completed Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ).</p>
<p>BASIS OF EVALUATION</p>
<p>1. The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to negotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the lowest price technically acceptable offer.</p>
<p>2. As stated in the solicitation, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In addition, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<br /><br />3. The LPTA process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition because the best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>4. An overall non-price factors rating must be at least "ACCEPTABLE" in order to be eligible for award. An "UNACCEPTABLE" rating in any factor results in the overall non-price factors proposal being rated "UNACCEPTABLE" unless corrected through discussions. An overall non-price factors rating of "UNACCEPTABLE" makes a proposal ineligible for award.</p>
<p>B. SAFETY EVALUATION</p>
<p>1. Per NFAS 15.304(b), solicitations utilizing source selection procedures for procurements within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia shall contain a standard "Safety" technical evaluation factor. This factor shall be included as a stand-alone evaluation factor and not as a sub-factor or an element of the Past Performance evaluation factor. This action will result in the selection of contractors that have consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and the ability to properly manage and implement safety procedures for themselves and all tiers of subcontractors under their purview.</p>
<p>2. The safety evaluation has three elements: Experience Modification Rate (EMR), Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) Days Away from Work, Job Restriction, or Transfer (DART), and Technical Approach to Safety.</p>
<p>3. The three elements of safety, as listed above, are not sub-factors. The evaluators should collectively consider all elements of safety when assigning an overall adjectival rating for this factor. The SSEB will need to make a qualitative determination of the rating for this factor, taking into account the risk ratings for EMR and DART and the subjective evaluation of the narrative.</p>
<p>4. Evaluators will not average the rating from the three years for the EMR and the DART.</p>
<p>4. The following should be utilized by evaluators as a general guideline to evaluate the <br />EMR and DART rates:</p>
<p>Risk EMR<br />Very Low Risk Less than 0.6<br />Low Risk From 0.6 to less than 0.8<br />Moderate Risk From 0.8 to 1.0<br />High Risk Greater than1.0 to 1.1<br />Extremely High Risk Greater than 1.1</p>
<p>Risk DART Rate <br />Very Low Risk Less Than 1.0 <br />Low Risk From 1.0 to 1.99 <br />Moderate Risk From 2.0 to 2.99 <br />High Risk From 3.0 to 4.0 <br />Extremely High Risk Greater than 4.0</p>
<p><br />C. ADJECTIVAL RATINGS/DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>Each offeror's technical factors and past performance will be evaluated separately. Upon the conclusion of the evaluation of the technical factors an overall non-price factors rating of Acceptable (A) or Unacceptable (U) will be assigned to each offeror's non-price factors proposal.</p>
<p>1. The following adjectival ratings and rating descriptions will be used to assign a rating to each technical factor. Use upper case letter ratings for major technical factor ratings. The addition of plus (+) or minus (-) to an adjective rating is not allowed.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable (A) Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable (U) Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br />The weaknesses and/or deficiencies (as defined below) of each proposal for each non-price evaluation factor which influenced the assigned adjectival rating shall be identified.<br /><br />Definitions <br />Weakness A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br />Significant Weakness A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.<br />Deficiency A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>
<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated when using the LPTA process, unless waived by the PCO in accordance with FAR 15.101-2(b). Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings in the following table:</p>
<p>Table A-2. Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable (A) Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable (U) Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(a) Aspects of Past Performance Evaluation. The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertain to the products and/or services outlined in the solicitation requirements. There are two aspects of the past performance evaluation.</p>
<p>(1) The first is to evaluate whether the offeror's present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired. The criteria to establish what is relevant is unique to each LPTA source selection. For this solicitation, The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based upon client satisfaction on recent relevant cell phone and black berry services within the last five (5) years. Client satisfaction will be measured based upon quality of work, effectiveness of management, timely completion of work, and compliance with safety standards. Further, as an integral part of client satisfaction, the Offeror's termination for default history and safety record will also be evaluated.</p>
<p>(2) The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts.</p>
<p>(b) SSEB members will review past performance information to determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p><br />D. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Offeror Experience <br />Factor 2 - Past Performance<br />Factor 3 - Safety</p>
<p>The distinction between Offeor Experience and Past Performance is Offeror Experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work completed by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past performance relates to how well a contractor has performed. <br /><br />2. Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor.</p>
<p>The relative order of importance of the technical evaluation factors are considered of equal weight, and when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>a. Price</p>
<p>(1) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The offeror shall submit the following in the order shown below in a sealed envelope. Envelope is to be clearly marked in the bottom right corner as follows:</p>
<p>Offeror's Name<br />PRICE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED UNDER RFP N40192-13-R-8008<br />DO NOT OPEN IN MAILROOM</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; Attachment 1 (Schedule and Exhibits A thru E).&nbsp; Offer is to complete all ELIN unit pricing for each contract period, which will becom the rates effective at contract award.<br /><br />(ii)&nbsp; Representations and Certifications.&nbsp; Offeror shall submit completed copies fo FAR 52.212-3, as well as DFARS 252.212-7000 or Oline Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) record.<br /><br />(iii) Joint Venture Agreement (if applicable)</p>
<p>(2) Basis of Evaluation: Prices will be evaluated for reasonableness based on:<br />(1) Comparison of proposed prices with other offers received in response to the solicitation; and (2) Comparison with the Independent Government Estimate. Unrealistically low (or high) proposed prices or prices unbalanced between the various option periods, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>b. Technical Factors:</p>
<p>(1) FACTOR 1, OFFEROR EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>(i) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The Offeror shall submit the following under Tab "1" of their proposal:</p>
<p>(1) Use format in Attachment 2 (Offeror Experience Project Data Sheet) to submit projects for evaluation under experience. Submit Attachment 2 under Tab "1" of the proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Submit projects for Black Berry and Cell Phone Wireless services.</p>
<p>(3) Submit projects completed or substantially completed (80% complete) within five-year period. The five-year period is calculated by counting back five years from the date set for the receipt of proposals in the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Submit a maximum of five (5) projects for the Offeror.</p>
<p>(5) Submit evidence of a binding teaming agreement or other contractual agreement which creates legal responsibility on the part of the subcontractors, as applicable. Proposals that fail to use format in Attachment 2 may be rated lower. All projects submitted which are outside the five-year period or above the maximum number allowed for consideration will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation. All projects submitted which are not relevant in scope will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation. Offerors who submit relevant projects for a subsidiary, satellite office, parent company, or predecessor company must fully explain how this office will participate in this contract. If it is not clear how this office will participate in this contract, the project will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation.</p>
<p>(ii) Basis of Evaluation: The Offeror's experience will be evaluated based upon demonstrated Black Berry and Cell Phone Wireless services experience similar in scope, size, type, and complexity to the work in the RFP.</p>
<p>(2) FACTOR 2, PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>(i) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The Offeror shall submit the following under Tab "2" of their proposal:</p>
<p>(1) Submit one of the following for each of the projects submitted under Factor 1 - Offeror Experience:</p>
<p>a. A Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ), a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) for Services, a Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS) Performance Evaluation - Construction Contract, or an Architect- Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluation.</p>
<p>b. If a commercial project, submit a PPQ.</p>
<p>c. If a Government project, submit a copy of a CPAR, CCASS, or ACASS. The Government will not evaluate any PPQ submitted for a Government project if an official CPAR, CCASS or ACASS evaluation exists in the Government database.</p>
<p>d. An interim CPAR, CCASS, ACASS or PPQ will be accepted for evaluation if an Offeror submits projects which are at least 80%,but less than 100% complete.</p>
<p>(2) If you are submitting a project that your firm performed as a subcontractor, the prime contractor may be cited as the client POC.</p>
<p>(3) Submit projects completed or substantially completed (at least 80%) within five-year period. The five-year period is calculated by counting back five years from the date set for the receipt of proposals in the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Submit a maximum of five (5) projects for the Offeror.</p>
<p>(2) Basis of Evaluation: The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based upon client satisfaction on recent relevant cell phone and black berry wireless services within the last five (5) years. Client satisfaction will be measured based upon quality of work, effectiveness of management, timely completion of work, and compliance with safety standards. Further, as an integral part of client satisfaction, the Offeror's termination for default history and safety record will also be evaluated. The Government's sources of information for evaluating past performance may include, but are not limited to, any and all information provided by the contractor, inquiries of owner representative(s), any other known sources not provided by the Offeror, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.</p>
<p>(3) FACTOR 3, SAFETY:</p>
<p>(i) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The Offeror shall submit the following information under Tab "3": (For a partnership or joint venture, the following submittal requirements are required for each contractor who is part of the partnership or joint venture; however, only one safety narrative is required. EMR and DART Rates shall not be submitted for subcontractors.)<br />(1) Experience Modification Rate (EMR): For the three previous complete calendar years, 2010, 2011 and 2012, submit your EMR (which compares your company's annual losses in insurance claims against its policy premiums over a three year period). If you have no EMR, affirmatively state so, and explain why. Any extenuating circumstances that affected the EMR and upward or downward trends should be addressed as part of this element. Lower EMRs will be given greater weight in the evaluation.</p>
<p>(2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate: For the three previous complete calendar years 2010, 2011 and 2012, submit your OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate, as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. If you cannot submit an OSHA DART Rate, affirmatively state so, and explain why. Any extenuating circumstances that affected the OSHA DART Rate data and upward or downward trends should be addressed as part of this element. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be given greater weight in the evaluation. <br /><br />(3) Technical Approach for Safety: Describe the plan that the Offeror will implement to evaluate safety performance of potential subcontractors, as a part of the selection process for all levels of subcontractors. Also, describe any innovative methods that the Offeror will employ to ensure and monitor safe work practices at all subcontractor levels. The Safety Narrative shall be limited to two pages.</p>
<p>(ii) Basis of Evaluation: The Government is seeking to determine that the Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and that the Offeror plans to properly manage and implement safety procedures for itself and its subcontractors. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's overall safety record, the Offeror's plan to select and monitor subcontractors, any and innovative safety methods that the Offeror plans to implement for this procurement. The Government's sources of information for evaluating safety may include, but are not limited to, OSHA, NAVFAC's Facility Accident and Incident Reporting (FAIR) database, and other related databases. While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete safety information regarding these submittal requirements rests with the Offeror.
