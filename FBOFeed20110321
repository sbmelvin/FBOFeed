<DESC>Total Program (ID/IQ Scope) - Reusable Booster System (RBS) Flight and Ground Experiments
<p>The Air Force has identified the Reusable Booster System (RBS) concept as a promising approach to meet its future spacelift needs. The RBS consists of an autonomous, reusable, rocket-powered first stage with an expendable upper stage stack. The reusable first stage launches vertically and carries the expendable stack to the staging point. From the staging point, the reusable first stage returns directly to the launch base, landing aircraft-style on a runway.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Air Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RB) located at Wright Patterson AFB, is interested in flight and ground experiments and demonstrations to address key technologies, processes and system attributes (TPSAs) associated with the RBS concept.</p>

<p>CMS must ensure that the PFDC has participated in the development of the business and technical requirements for the file transfer between the PFDC, National Level Repository, Treasury, and the Medicare Bank and that they modify their internal systems to capture these data and to transfer updates from the monthly payment activity back into the NLR. It is essential to the success of the HITECH program that the PFDC has adequate staffing and financial resources to gather information and attend meetings associated with requirements development and to report progress through the integrated schedule. Finally, it is critical that the PFDC establish and manage data integrity test protocols to ensure that data reported from their internal systems is identical to reports generated from the NLR.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer determined at time of award that a Cost-Reimbursement contract was suitable for this requirement as uncertainties in the services required did not permit the Government or contractor to estimate with sufficient accuracy in order to use a fixed-price contract.</p>

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing a fully managed cellular Wireless Access Solution that supports a multi-carrier service provisions, uninterrupted connectivity, and maintenance for the mobile phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Blackberries, cellular network cards, pagers, etc., for personnel and students assigned to the MMAC. Equipment must allow signal access for all carriers on the FAA National Wireless Contract (AT&T, Sprint/Nextel, Verizon, T-Mobile, Alltel, Skytel, (pagers), USA Mobility (pagers), Global Star, and Iridium. It is also anticipated that there will be a requirement for either contractor-furnished training to the FAA personnel for post implementation maintenance of the systems provided or contractor maintenance support of the systems provided for a period of time after the government acceptance of the system. 
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517210, Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), with a size standard of 1,500 employees.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, intends to negotiate with Catholic University of America, 620 Michigan Avenue, Washington D.C. 20064, for the following services outline in the statement of work. <br />.<br />Background Information:<br />The goal of this contract is to procure computer software programming support for the development of confocal microscopy imaging system, and image processing, visualization, and quantification tools for the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics (LCE).
<p>To increase the volumetric coverage in conventional confocal microscopy imaging, an automated system, Rapid Overlapping-Volume Acquisition and Reconstruction (ROVAR), has been developed in the LCE to rapidly acquire consecutive non-planar 3D image stacks. The current setup of the system involves a dedicated computer workstation to receive and process real-time data from the microscope, and to control a dynamic stage and a focusing unit for consecutive 3D acquisition. The alignment of individual 3D image stacks is currently performed on a separate computer workstation offline to assemble those image stacks to a large jointed volume after the acquisition.<br />Purpose and Objectives:<br />To improve the efficiency of the data acquisition and post processing workflow, there is a need to gain software support to enhance the features of the current system for image acquisition and processing. Furthermore, there are additional needs to develop software tools for microscopic image analysis to support ongoing research of the Integrative Physiology program at the LCE.</p>
<p>The current computer software application of the ROVAR system was written in Labview framework by calling Leica drivers to control the microscope stage and focus unit. The software application may also perform external procedure and function calls to image visualization and processing libraries developed by other researchers or collaborators.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:<br />The Contractor is required to successfully accomplish the tasks listed as well as having excellent programming skills but also a comprehensive knowledge of computer vision and computer graphics. We need a contracting entity with C++, OpenGL, CUDA, and IDL experience and multi-year experience working in the field of image processing and computational modeling. Additional areas of interest include parallel or distributed computing, and GPU computing. We foresee that most of the tasks could be completed by a junior computer programmer/scientist with several years of programming experience in C++, IDL and good knowledge of image processing and computer graphics. <br />Specific features and functions for software development to improve the current image acquisition workflow may include, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>Automated Volume Alignment:<br />To implement existing algorithms or to design new algorithms for aligning non-planar 3D image stacks inline on the ROVAR computer system. This function will be implemented as a standalone function/library and be called from the Labview framework for fast volume alignment.<br />3D Vessel Viewer:<br />To develop 3D visualization tools for inline viewing of multi-channel image volumes. This viewer will be implemented as a standalone function/library and to be called from the Labview framework for interactive real-time inspection of the</p>
<p>3D data send from the acquisition system. This viewer will also be capable of displaying the automated aligned 3D volume.</p>
<p>Image Quality Metrics:<br />To study image quality metrics or indices that can be used toward improving and guiding image acquisition and volume alignment. Once effective indices or metrics are determined, a standalone function/library will be implemented and be called from the Labview framework to rapidly provide useful feedback to improve the successful rate of image acquisition.</p>
<p>In additional to the software development for image acquisition, software development for improving the post processing and image analysis of the 3D volume is of high interest. Specific features and functions for software development in image processing and modeling include, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>Vessel Segmentation:<br />The current post processing tools for 3D vessel segmentation are implemented in IDL, which consist of several image processing components. Some of the components are preliminarily developed for prototyping and not necessary optimized for computational speed or definite accuracy. To further improve the robustness, effectiveness and the usability of these image processing components, there is a need to study advanced algorithms for, i) enhancement filtering; to increase vesselness measures and to mitigate imaging artifacts for image segmentation, ii) feature extractions and pattern classification; to increase the robustness and accuracy of vessel segmentation, iii) computation speed up; to develop or implement more efficient algorithms or through hardware acceleration.</p>
<p>Vessel Geometry Modeling:<br />The current procedure in computing vessel geometry starts with 3D skeletonization of the binarized vessel volume. This process is implemented in IDL through an iterative process of voxel "peeling", which is very time-consuming and can be biased from non-symmetric geometry. It is necessary to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, not only to speed up the computation but also to increase the accuracy. Further geometrical processing and computations such as vessel radius measurements, and vessel pathway tracking, etc. are underway. These computation and study of the vessel topology may aid to further pattern classification of different vessel/fiber types, or to differentiate distinct vessel structure in different tissues.</p>
<p>Period of performance:<br />The junior person is expected to perform the assigned tasks at least two days a week on site for a total of 1000 hours per year. Services are to be delivered between the dates of 4/1/2011 through 3/31/2012. Work will be performed at the NIH campus, Bldg. 10, Rm. B1S219 in cooperation with NHLBI/LCE researchers.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:<br />The selected entity will distribute and present the work on a regular basis to the laboratory and in particular will discuss its potential use of integration needs with the LCE staffs. The deliverable will include compiled computer programs and source codes, comments and usage inside the source code, and relevant documents.</p>
<p>Program Management and Control Requirements:<br />The selected entity will meet with LCE staffs weekly on NIH campus to discuss the progress of the project and plans for future implementation.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:<br />The selected entity will meet with LCE staffs regularly to present the software release and to provide assistance for user training, technical support, report writing, and bug fixings.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities:<br />Office/lab space will be provided on the NIH campus, Bldg. 10, Rm. B1D416, with personal computer workstation and laptops access to NHLBI network. NIH will provide all software and required sample images. The work will be conducted within standard NIH research policy.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Issues:<br />It is understood that nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute, by implication or otherwise, the grant to the contractor (herein "Entity") of any license or other rights under any patent, patent application or other intellectual property right or interest belonging to the NHLBI. Entity retains all intellectual property rights in its software products, copyrighted data file formats, and previously developed code. The specific computer software and source code, and overall system as modified by any procedure by the contracting entity will be the exclusive property of NHLBI; shall be 508 compliant by understanding of, and expertise in, the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p>The sole source determination consideration is due to the fact that the computer software, as described in the SOW, was developed by individuals at CUA as a joint collaboration with NHLBI. Alternative approaches of hiring software programmers to accomplish similar tasks would result in the delay of our project development. Such a government driven process would be more time consuming due to the training, and managing quantified individuals. In addition, certain computer source code required for software modification and system integration is owned by the individuals at CUA. It is important to have a continuum of support and services from the CUA to expedite our project development.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 611310, Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools with size standard of $7.0 million; this is not a small business set-aside..</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-49 (January 24, 2011).</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) will be soliciting proposals from qualified businesses (NAICS Code 541712) with capabilities to conduct a large national longitudinal cohort study and establish a regulatory-science framework to monitor the behavioral and health impacts of provisions in the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA). The FSPTCA gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco-product advertising, labeling, marketing, constituents, ingredients and additives in the United States. These regulatory changes are expected to influence tobacco-product risk perceptions, use patterns, and exposures, and to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality over time. The study initially will focus on designing the sample, establishing the cohort, collecting data on a yearly basis, developing a database, arranging a central specimen repository, and measuring and reporting on the near-term behavioral and health effects of the regulatory changes. NIDA anticipates that over time, the study will involve continued cohort monitoring, additional recruitment of young adults to the cohort at each wave, cross-sectional analyses within age groups and longitudinal data analysis, including analysis of distal outcomes, and small area estimation modeling. Results from this study are expected to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of tobacco-product regulations in the United States (For detailed information on FSPTCA, see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ031.111.pdf). <br /><br />The successful contractor must have the in-house capability and multi-disciplinary knowledge, expertise, and experience required to: <br /><br />&bull; Plan and execute large national longitudinal behavioral health studies with sufficient power to detect immediate and long-term outcomes with small-to-moderate effect sizes in the entire sample and in designated subgroups; <br />&bull; Develop, field test, and implement sample designs, assessment instruments, and data-collection protocols; <br />&bull; Ascertain and maintain locator information for participant tracking, retention, and follow up;<br />&bull; Collect, store, package, and ship bio-specimens for laboratory analysis and preservation in a specimen repository; <br />&bull; Organize and convene meetings with subject-matter experts and advisors with expertise in, among others, epidemiology, natural history, and longitudinal cohort research, tobacco-related disease processes and clinical outcomes, and tobacco-product policies; <br />&bull; Collect and analyze economic, social, and geographic data to augment data collected from individuals on social contextual and other influences on individual behaviors; <br />&bull; Validate self-reported data on incident health outcomes with medical records-based information and through use of multiple causes of death data from the National Death Index, the National Social Security death files, or the Division of Vital Records of state health departments; and,<br />&bull; Develop small-area estimation models; and produce clean ready datasets and documentation for each data-collection wave and the entire cohort.<br />Additionally, businesses must have the capabilities and experience required to develop and submit study materials for the collection of information from more than nine individuals to the Office of Management and Budget for timely review and approval.<br /><br />We anticipate the award of one cost reimbursement, non-severable, completion contract for a base period of one year plus four one year options. In addition to the options to extend the contract period, there are option tasks and quantities. NIDA anticipates substantial subcontracting opportunities under this project. <br /><br />RFP No. N01DA-11-5568 will be available electronically on or about April 5, 2011.

<DESC>In 2001 the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at the National Institutes of Health convened an exploratory workshop at which considerable agreement emerged among government, industry, and academic stakeholders that a national dietary supplement labels database was needed in order to support and enhance research activities. Dietary supplements marketed and sold in the United States are regulated more like foods than like drugs and there is no extensively-populated research database of dietary supplement labels available to serve the needs of scientists, researchers, and educators. A variety of incomplete and fragmented databases currently exist with far less functionality and far fewer data records than what is ultimately envisioned for the ODS research Dietary Supplement Labels Database (DSLD). <br />The Office of Dietary Supplements research DSLD was developed as a prototype and successfully demonstrated, with a sample of 600 dietary supplement labels, to a panel of Federal Stakeholders in May 2009. <br />The Office of Dietary Supplements seeks, through this effort, to populate its web-based research Dietary Supplement Labels Database with label data from the estimated 50,000 dietary supplements sold in the United States. <br /><br />This is a notice of intent for a base year plus four option year fixed price contract.&nbsp; A Request for Contract (RFP) will be issued on or about 15 days from this notice.&nbsp; Interested parties should view the FEDBIZOPPS for postings

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson Laboratories, in Jefferson, Arkansas, is seeking business sources, including total small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and 8(a) certified companies. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:
<p>The government is seeking capability statements from small business manufacturing companies that can provide a parallel bioreactor system for mammalian cell culture with at least (8) vessels. The vessels are glass and have metal housings and head plates and the unit must be autoclavable (at 121&deg;C) to provide a sterile environment for cell growth. The system must have physical and software capabilities to utilize existing equipment and potentially new acquisitions. The Division of Product Quality Research currently has basic bioreactor capabilities and needs to expand capacity to support the characterization of the Monoclonal Antibody manufacturing process to understand critical variables and utilize process analytical techniques (PAT) and Quality by Design (QbD) techniques.</p>
<p>The instrument system shall meet the technical requirements described herein.</p>
<p>&bull; Parallel bioreactor system for mammalian cell culture with 8 vessels to study the effects of changes in the manufacturing process on product quality attributes. The vessels are glass and have metal housings and head plates and the unit must be autoclavable (at 121&deg;C) to provide a sterile environment for cell growth. The division needs to expand its ability to characterize the monoclonal antibody production process to understand critical variables and utilize process analytical techniques (PAT) and Quality by Design (QbD) techniques.<br />&bull; Size: 400 mL-1200 mL vessels, but flexibility in the size of vessels utilized by the system up to 4L, without having to change modules or controllers, only by changing vessel assemblies.<br />&bull; Head plate: Metal with at least 6 threaded and capped 13.5pg (12mm) or 19mm ports (or combination of the two sizes) for Required sensors and piping, with 1 PG13.5 (12mm) Port available for the addition of 3rd party probe (furnished as a plug cap or septum)<br />o Probes to be supplied and monitored: pH, dissolved Oxygen, and temperature. <br />o Adequate Ports and Piping: Sampling, feeding, sparge, and exhaust<br />o Multiports: At least 2 of the dedicated headplate ports will utilize at least 3 input and/our outputs on a single port. The multiports may be used for feeding pumps, sampling, gas addition/exhaust, or other purposes but must not interact with each individual activity of the components in the multiport.<br />o Temperature Control: Automatic temperature control via heating and cooling, can be jacketed vessel, electric heating with cooling fingers, or equivalent. The source must supply an adequate Recirculating chiller (if necessary) to support their system to maintain precise temperature control.<br />&bull; Capable of independent vessel control of heating, cooling, agitation rate, substrate feed rates, and other probes.<br />&bull; Capable of physical and software integration of optional 3rd party probes and accessories (such as FT-NIR, Auto samplers, etc...).<br />&bull; Gas mixing off all 4 supply gasses (Nitrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen, and Compressed Air) to support 4 vessels, must be performed by a mass flow controller equipped electrothermal control.<br />&bull; At least (16) Peristaltic feeding pumps (2 per vessel) which can be individually adjusted for speed, run in reverse, run in "triggered" feed mode based on shifts in operating conditions, and programmed via algorithmic logic to make real time automated processing adjustments based on internal processing data, as well as external OPC connected real time at-line analytical data (i.e. nutrient analysis, cell count/viability, HPLC analysis, and others). Additionally, the control software needs to account for varying tube sizing for accurate delivery. The pumps must be capable of extremely low flow rates of 0.1mL/Hr, while maintaining accuracy. <br />&bull; Overhead drives (not magnetic driven stirrers) must be used to stir the vessel with a pitched blade impeller. <br />&bull; Individual support structures to prevent the reactors from falling over or sitting directly on the benchtop.<br />&bull; OPC connectivity, licenses, and installation for each of the 8 vessels, capable of monitoring critical processing parameters and creating a control feedback loop with the option of user defined algorithmic logic for automated processing decisions, from external analytical and sampling accessory values with accessibility from remote locations. <br />&bull; Run data exportation: The bioreactor software must be able to export run data to MS excel for end of run data manipulation, appropriate macros or excel add ins for charting and data organization must be provided. Time stamping must occur automatically, and storage of in-process data should only be limited by the hard drive of the space of the system computer (i.e. 5 days of data with an autoreset is unacceptable). All data should be easily exported for further processing and backup.</p>
<p><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division is seeking sources and/or information for the following Horizon Reference System (HRS) Upgrade.<br />1. Background: <br />The legacy Horizon Reference Set (HRS), P/N A/W37A-1, provides a stabilized horizon reference to assist helicopter pilots in landing on decks of small frigates, destroyers, and cruisers. The US Navy has been using the HRS on all helicopter equipped surface combatants since the beginning of LAMPS MK III ships in the early 1980's. The current issues on the HRS is obsolescence of components, primarily the Standard Electronic Modules (SEM)s Cards and the Electric Motor. The legacy does not comply with the required Night Vision (NVIS) compatibility. Also, there is degradation of light intensity and uneven intensity when lighting panels are replaced. These issues and the availability of improvements in technology and industry advancements made in recent years has led to the decision to upgrade the current HRS. <br />2. Technical: <br />The HRS Upgrade effort objective is to modernize the existing EL Panel Bar to LED Technology and change the Control System to replace the existing SEM Cards with PCBs. The new LED Warning Lamp with Daylight Sensor will also be replaced. There will be an upgrade to the existing ISD 400 Hz Motor/Gearbox with a new 50/60 Hz unit. The existing controls and indicators will be upgrades to be Night Vision Compliant. <br />The benefits of the HRS Upgrade effort will include reduces total ownership costs, improved maintainability, and reduced obsolescence.<br />The HRS Upgrade effort will include design and drawing updates. Full functional testing and test report will be required. <br />Representatives of US companies who have subsidiaries in foreign countries expecting to participate will also be considered under foreign national rules. <br />Since the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the drawing package is mailed. It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 numbers) number and a company's CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense. <br />This is not a request for proposal. No solicitation package is available. Respondents to this request for information are invited to submit a statement of general interest, a description of any currently available unit which meets our requirements and/or a discussion on the feasibility of the above described unit. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.<br />Submission Information: Copies of the DD Form 2345 and written responses to this RFI are requested to be submitted by 21 April 2011to Ms. Deborah Dewyea, (732)-323-7068, Fax # (732)-323-7192.

<DESC>1.	The Government is issuing this announcement as part of a market survey for a long endurance, ship-based, offboard vehicle capable of carrying an active Electronic Warfare (EW) payload for use in next generation coordinated Onboard/Offboard EW countermeasures missions.  

2.	To achieve EW mission effectiveness the vehicle must be compatible with ship operations in the maritime environment up to and including sea state five conditions.  Innovative technologies are required that minimize the shipboard operational and logistics footprint concerning storage, refueling, maintenance, safety, and launch and recovery operations.  It is envisioned that ship systems will provide initial positioning, velocity, and vehicle direction information.
  The system should be capable of autonomous operation and have communications capability for minimal interaction with the launch/control platform to receive mission updates and report health and location status.  Concepts for this vehicle system must be realized while minimizing manning requirements during shipboard operation.  Technologies that utilize shipboard available energy sources are essential and use of existing command and control links on U.S. Navy ships is preferred.  Liquid fuel based systems must comply with DoD Directive 4140.25 regarding fuel standardization.  Potential vehicle solutions may include but are not limited to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs).
  Expendable systems concepts will be considered if they can be shown to provide total cost of ownership benefits.

3.	The vehicle must be able to carry a nominal 35 lb. payload (minimum 25 lb. to maximum 50 lb.),  provide 1KW of payload prime power and accommodate placement of a transmit and receive antenna pair with an unobstructed 90 degree field of regard, integrated with the vehicle platform to achieve maximum transmit to receive isolation. The vehicle must be capable of steering the vehicle/antenna pair over a 360 degree azimuth in winds from any direction.  Each vehicle must be able to achieve and maintain station keeping relative to ships position for a minimum of 2 hours duration, with longer duration preferred.
 The systems concept must show command & control capability for operating 3 platforms simultaneously from a single control station and conducting sorties to achieve continuous station keeping for a mission length of 24 hours, with minimum impact to shipboard storage, operations, and required manpower.  For the purposes of this RFI, assume the system is stored, deployed, and operated from a single ship, and a single control and handling crew will be utilized to support the entire mission. 

4.	This market survey will support an Analysis of Alternatives where vehicle analysis will take into account physical characteristics, operational effectiveness, suitability, logistical characteristics, and life-cycle cost to assess particular vehicles potential abilities to successfully execute the mission.
 Conclusions drawn from the AoA will form a portion of the basis for a Milestone B decision, currently planned for FY13.  Funding for this effort is expected to be available in FY12 with a low rate initial production planned for FY18.

5.	The government is seeking interested parties that may have developed or would be capable of developing potential vehicle solutions for this analysis that have one of the following attributes:

a.	Vehicle/system performance that can meet stated requirements with either little or moderate adaptation, upgrade, modification, or development from an existing demonstrated and tested system. Technology risks associated with the vehicle have been sufficiently reduced such that the system can achieve a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 at Milestone B.
  TRL 6 is achieved when system/subsystem models or prototypes have been demonstrated for this program in a relevant marine environment (Source: Defense Acquisition Guidebook)

b.	Innovative solutions that have not fully matured but that can be shown to be expected to meet the requirements in the allotted timeframe. 

6.	White paper responses to this RFI may be up to the SECRET level and may not exceed twenty (20) pages.  Interested sources possessing the capacity to deliver a vehicle system meeting the conditions outlined above are requested to respond.  Any information that the responder considers to be proprietary should be clearly marked.  The government will protect such information in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
  White paper responses should include the following items:

a.	General concept description or approach to meet the aforementioned requirements and attributes.
b.	System description to include, but not limited to:
i.	General vehicle/system description;
ii.	Vehicle operating characteristics (dash, cruise, & loiter speed, and system endurance referencing specific associated parameters); 
iii.	Vehicle dimensions, size, weight; 
iv.	Propulsion system description including fuel/energy source;
v.	Payload size and weight capacity, and power available;
vi.	Command/control/communications systems concept description for multi-vehicle operation and dynamic retasking considering maximum use of existing ships system;
vii.	Storage, launch, and recovery equipment, footprint, and procedures description;
viii.	Vehicle quantities, manpower and logistics to achieve mission; 
ix.	Ship compatibility and compatibility with marine environment;
x.	Cost information;
xi.	Current vehicle/system uses;
xii.	Technology Readiness Level information.
c.
   Performance requirements compliance matrix, using the format provided in the RFI attachment, to document the proposed systems ability to meet outlined requirements. Identify which capabilities have been demonstrated.
d.   Provide an assessment of the associated risks for the program and respective risk mitigation approaches.
e.   Identify performance requirements or functionality that would require adaptation, upgrade, modification or development.
f.	If necessary, provide a spiral development process that will result in a fully compliant vehicle in the desired timeframe.
g.   Any additional information to support claims that the system performance will meet the capabilities contained in this announcement.

7.	White paper responses are due May 13, 2011.
   If the response if classified, submit two (2) hard copies and one (1) electronic copy on compact disc to Erica Bowling at the following address:

Attn: Erica Bowling 02532B

If the response is unclassified, it may be submitted via email at erica.l.bowling@navy.mil.  

8.	The Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses.  Please note that the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions.  The Government may ultimately develop and issue a Request for Proposals (RFP)   However, the Government is under no obligation to issue an RFP.

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology to support centralized access to the PSTN while maintaining public safety (i.e., E911) services on a local level?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology to work with ISPs to properly route calls to include scenarios where the MILDEP is severed from the enterprise and only COOP dialing capability to the PSTN is available?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your recommendation to enforce security for sessions transmitted to/originated from an ISP?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> If multiple points of access were provided to an ISP, what is your recommendation to load balance between the various ISP Points of Presence (POPs)?</p>
<p><strong>(f)</strong> sustain survivability via regionalization;</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology and approach for "failover" from a Primary Enterprise LSC to a Secondary Enterprise LSC? How "service disrupting" is a failover from the Primary to the Secondary LSC?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology and approach to providing local survivable call processing and PSTN/E911 access capabilities in the event that access to Enterprise VVoIP Services is interrupted?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is your methodology and approach to "Failback" once access to the Enterprise VVoIP has been restored and detected?<br /><strong>Q:</strong> The DoD operates sites all over the world (Europe, Middle East, Pacific Rim, etc).

<CONTACT>Timothy J. Sass, Phone 4029952070, Email Timothy.J.Sass@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) Number W9128F-11-S-E111: Military Fueling Systems- construction, inspection, and repair in support for the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Sustainability, Reliability, and Maintenance Program (SRM).
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm or corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>The Omaha District, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is seeking information about potential sources interested and capable of providing services under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Construction Code 237120.</p>
<p>NAICS CODE 237120, Size Standard $33.5M.</p>
<p>This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of oil and gas lines, mains, refineries, and storage tanks. The work performed may include new work, reconstruction, rehabilitation and repairs. Specialty trade contractors are included in this group if they are engaged in activities primarily related to oil and gas pipeline and related structures construction. All structures (including buildings) that are integral parts of oil and gas networks (e.g. storage tanks, pumping stations, and refineries) are included in this industry.</p>
<p>This RFI constitutes a market research tool for the collection and analyses of information to determine the capabilities and capacity of interested contractors to execute Military Fueling Systems construction, inspection, and repair in support for military customers, within the Department of Defense and various other federal and local agencies requesting the services, as necessary.</p>
<p>SCOPE REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The scopes of work will include, but not be limited to construction: replacement of aging fuel components; repair of storage tanks and containment areas, providing systems upgrade and maintenance and the incidental design to support the aforementioned construction identified in compliance with all state and federal regulations. It is anticipated that a majority of the task orders will be cost-reimbursable. There is the potential for some fixed price type contract actions. The nature of the military fuel systems mission is such that the nature and size of requirements are sometimes unpredictable. As needs are identified, corrective measures must be implemented quickly.</p>
<p>The scope of work for this acquisition includes:</p>
<p>A. Construction: Cost-reimbursable design and construction of fueling systems and supporting facilities at military installations. <br />B. Minor Maintenance and Repair (MMR): Minor repair and maintenance ("replacement in kind") of existing fueling systems and equipment, performed as needed, with minimal delay ("rapid response"). <br />C. Tank Leak Detection: The maintenance inspection, repair, alteration, relocation, and reconstruction of welded or riveted, atmospheric pressure, aboveground storage tanks after they have been placed in service, to verify compliance with API 653 and other applicable standards. <br />D. Hydrant Calibration: Inspection and adjustment of Type III, IV, and V Hydrant Fueling systems.<br />E. Fuel Pipe Leak Detection: Pressure tests of above and underground fuel piping to verify compliance with API 653 and other applicable standards.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements include:</p>
<p>Project locations may exist at all DOD installations, Outside Continental United States (OCONUS), and Continental United States (CONUS). Construction requirements include fast track scheduling and performance, with incidental design. All work must be performed with USACE guidance to State and Federal requirements.</p>
<p>TYPES OF CONTRACTS</p>
<p>Best practices and lessons learned from past operations success include competition, socio-economic participation, service provider capability of both fixed price and possible cost reimbursement type contracts and advanced contracts commonly known as multiple award task order contracts (MATOC). The Government currently anticipates awarding multiple contracts to large and small businesses with geographic limitations on small business set-asides i.e., CONUS only. All sub-categories of small businesses are being considered during our market research phase. Based upon approval, it is projected that each contract awarded will have a basic ordering period of two (2) years with one additional option period of three (3) years, for a total of five (5) years of performance.

<DESC>AVIATION INDUSTRY SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<p>Brief description: Sources Sought for a CN235 airframe that will be converted to a Maintenance Training Unit at USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, NC.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products or services that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG Aviation Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine the availability of firms that can provide the following:</p>
<p>1. CN235 Aircraft Model 100, 200, or 300<br />2. Working hydraulic and mechanical systems<br />3. Structurally sound<br />4. Towable via landing gear <br />5. All control surfaces intact and in general good working order</p>
<p>The Coast Guard will consider varied aircraft configurations with acceptable functionality that it feels can be converted into a maintenance training unit or aid. Along with providing information regarding the aircraft, potential sources are requested to provide a response to the following questions or inquiries:</p>
<p>Logistics questions:</p>
<p>1. Is the aircraft capable of flight?<br />2. If not, does the potential source possess or can obtain the necessary resources to:<br />a. Disassemble the aircraft?<br />b. Prepare and preserve the aircraft for transportation to a major airport or major sea port selected by the Coast Guard.?<br />c. Transport or coordinate the transportation and modes of shipment of the disassembled aircraft to Elizabeth City, North Carolina?<br />d. Provide manpower or can obtain the necessary manpower resources to reassemble the aircraft at Elizabeth City, North Carolina?<br />3. Is there an industry standard for disassembly of an aircraft or accreditation and can the potential source provide this industry standard or accreditation for review and validation?</p>
<p>Each potential source is also requested to provide the contract number(s), dollar value(s) and brief description of work previously (within the past 10 years) or currently being performed, which specifically demonstrates the contractor's ability to successfully satisfy USCG requirements identified above. Firms shall also provide point of contact information (name, telephone number, email address) where available for the efforts cited above.</p>
<p>The USCG believes the applicable NAICS code is 336412 - Aircraft engine repair and overhauling. Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?

After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO). Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract. Responses to this sources sought notice shall be e-mailed to Wade.Johnson@uscg.mil. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Responses must be received no later than 04 April 2011 at 1515 hours (3:15 PM EST). Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the USCG make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to any subsequent solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THESE SOURCES SOUGHT OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your responses to this sources sought will be treated as informational only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this sources sought or Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this sources sought. The information resulting from this sources sought may be included in one or more RFP's, which may be released via the FEDBIZOPPS.GOV portal.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this publication is to enhance competition (see para. b) by notifying prospective vendors of the intent to modify the Landing Gear Prime Vendor Contracts (LGPVC) (see para. a).
<p>(a) The Landing Gear Commodity Council anticipates modifying the Landing Gear Prime Vendor multiple award IDIQ Contracts FA8203-08-D-0001, 0002, 0003, &amp; 0004 awarded 6 May 2008. These contracts were awarded to Eagle (HDI-USA), ES3, HTI, and LSI under a 100% small business set-aside provisions for a ten-year ordering period and an estimated contract ceiling for all four multiple award contracts of $1.5B. This contract modification will incorporate parts that were not initially priced because either (1) they had not been screened to determine competitive status, or (2) past usage and future forecast requirements did not warrant inclusion at that time. The parts to be included have since been screened and determined to be competitive and are now reflecting future requirements estimated at $8.8M per year. The total estimated annual value of purchases for these items is within the initially estimated LGPVC $1.5B ceiling and does not change prime vendor performance requirements or contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>(b) This notice improves prospective supplier access to acquisition information and enhances competition by identifying subcontracting opportunities to those manufacturers who are qualified or may become qualified to produce them under the provisions set forth in the basic Contracts. The basic contracts and the list and description of parts scheduled to be included can be reviewed at the LGPVC web site at URL http://www2.hill.af.mil/LGPVC/index.htm. Those parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contract the above listed primes to obtain any technical data or other information needed and respond directly to them.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Technology Systems & Program Integration Directorate (TSPID) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: ROCKWELL COLLINS OPTRONICS, INC., Carlsbad, CA 92010.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The Rockwell Collins' ProView PV35 (C)(G) is a compact, versatile and lightweight high resolution full color SVGA helmet mounted display (HMD) with low power consumption and extremely rugged. The HMD is being requested by the SNLPI team for the technology development and demonstration activity of the Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) system. In order to successfully integrate and interoperate the WPAN system to the Proview PV35 HMD (c)(G), a system engineering support service is necessary in order for the WPAN team to be able to ask the Rockwell developers for support related to the PV-35 HMD (c)(G). <br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br> Rockwell Collin Optronics is the only manufacturer and reseller of the ProView PV35 (C)(G) and specific ancillaries. This ProView PV35 HMD (C) G) is the baseline HMD use by <br>Nett-Warrior system. The WPAN system is targeted to be transition to the Net-Warrior program of record in FY12. The ProView PV35 HMD is the only HMD video platform that will meet the demonstration requirement directed by our PM/PEO partners.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>The ProView PV35 HMD (C)(G) is a high resolution full color SVGA helmet mounted display that is compatible with the Wireless Personal Area Network and developmental Soldier systems that the SNLPI team has developed. Any other variant within the SVGA HMD family is not compatible with the protocol and data format exchanges within the WPAN architecture, and will not meet PM/PEO video platform requirements for the WPAN prototype demonstration in <br>FY 12.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>The ProView PV35 HMD (C)(G) has been extensively tested by PM SWAR and other developmental organization. It is the current defined baseline Helmet Mounted Display solution for the Land Warrior Program of Record. The ProView PV35 HMD (C)(G) allows maximum compatibility with WPAN Architecture and will meet the video platform demonstration requirements by our PM\PEO partners. Any other product will put successful experimentation and demonstration at risk jeopardizing this team's ability to transition effective and reliable <br>components.<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>None<br><br>6.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army Combat Feeding Directorate (CF), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: E-CONTROL SYSTEMS INC., Sherman Oaks, CA 91403.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br><br>INQUIRIES WILL BE USED FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ONLY.<br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The procurement request is for equipment items that monitor temperature, door openings, closings, and diagnose compressor run-times and food service equipment health status. After conducting market research only E-Controls has these items that can operate on a secure network within the military environment. It is imperative for equipment integration to be able to be CAC Card and VPN enabled and have all these items that can work with each other without major security violations or configuration changes that would be more costly. The Combat Feeding Directorate (CFD) worked with NSRDEC IMD to ensure this system meets their network requirement, which it does. The E-Control system has been certified by the Navy Safety and Security Center to meet Hazardous Electronic Radiance to Ordinance (HERO) certification. CFD/SEET has been working this Navy R&D project for over a year with EControl and has the system in place here, the Submarine Base, New London, CT and at Cape Canaveral, FL. The items ordered will be installed by the Systems Equipment & Engineering Team on all refrigeration assets and one dishwasher here at CFD. E-Control is the only responsible source for this procurement request based on the unique naval environment, network security for both the Army and Navy requirements. To meet a research, engineering and development project requirement for testing and evaluation due to the Navy requesting the CFD/SEET perform reliability testing on all food service equipment assets the Navy procures. The Navy currently doesn't have this capability. Lack of these capabilities has resulted in numerous products being disposed of due to equipment failures. If testing and evaluation prove it's a valuable resource for the Navy the SEET will forward a test report and make recommendations for inclusion in the logistics procurement catalog.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>E-Control has extensive knowledge and technology in temperature monitoring for all foodservice equipment items, and refrigeration diagnostics for refrigerated units as well as insuring that HACCP regulatory specifications are met. The E-Control has the lowest and safest frequency output in the industry that will not interfere with Navy ammunition or weapons. The system meets all Navy requirements for shipboard use. Prior to E-Control another vendor was explored whose system was unsecure and very costly. The Systems Equipment and Engineering Team evaluated multiple vendors' systems prior to down selection of the E-Control system.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>A market research was performed and currently E-Control is the only manufacturer that can monitor temperature, door open/closed and compressor run-time within a secure network environment. The Natick IMD Directorate has approved the use of E-Control Hardware and Software for this test and evaluation.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>As part of the SEET's testing & evaluation process and mission to provide the military services with the most economically feasible and reliable food service equipment this procurement is submitted so testing and evaluation can be accomplished and recommendations forwarded to the Navy.<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>The E-Control Software and Licenses are already in place at CFD, the system has passed all security and HERO certifications. To try and go with another vendor would be very costly due to not only having to procure their software and licenses, but the cost associated with certifying the new software, hardware and the system to meet all security and HERO requirements. The risk associated with procurement from another vendor is to high and not cost effective. The Navy has requested that the SEET test and evaluate temperature monitoring diagnostic detection of equipment assets to save countless dollars in wasted provisions, time and labor due to failure of these assets.<br><br>6.

<SOLNBR>N6264511024E0
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:Acquisitions@med.navy.mil">NMLC Code 024E</a>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command has a continuing requirement for multi-disciplinary dental services at Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, CA; Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), CA; NH Lemoore; and any associated branch clinics as well as any DoD or Coast Guard Military Treatment Facility (MTF) and Dental Treatment Facilities (DTFs) within the Southwestern United States to include the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. This need will be satisfied by sole source bridges to contracts N62645-06-D-5014, N62645-06-D-5015, N62645-06-D-5016, and N62645-06-D-5017 to extend services of the firm-fixed price, personal services contracts. Award will be made to incumbents DPS, Inc., Mid America Health, Inc., RLM Services, Inc., and The OMO Group, Inc.
 on firm-fixed price contracts. The bridge contracts will continue to provide dental services, through 31 July 2012. Services are required for a base period of performance of 01 July 2011 - 30 June 2012, and an additional option period of 01 July 2012 - 31 July
2012. Additionally, one two-month and one one-month option periods are being included to account for unexpected delays in the procurement process for the new MATO, which could potentially extend services under the bridge contracts
through 31 October 2012.  These companies are the only known contractors that can provide continuity of care with the health care workers who have been privileged to work at the aforementioned sites and are trained and familiar with hospital procedures.
  The lead-time required for an alternate contractor to recruit and hire a replacement staff, submit Individual Professional Files for each health care worker and for the sites to complete the privileging process does not exist prior to the required 01 July 2011
start date.  Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement in a proposal to this office by 2:00 pm, EDST, on Tuesday, 29 March 2011 by email to Acquisitions@med.navy.mil (reference code 024E in
subject line) or telefaxed to 301-619-6793. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>AIR FORCE MEDICAL MODELING AND SIMULATION PROGRAM - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE AND DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ); IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>This document shall serve as the overall parent document for the attached RFIs. It consists of five separate RFIs that will be used within the Air Force Medical Modeling and Simulation (AFMM&amp;S) Program's enterprise delivery of cutting-edge medical education and training. The competing missions of war, beneficiary care, homeland security, natural disaster and pandemic response training have put huge demands on the military medical service. Due to the dissimilar nature of civilian versus battlefield trauma and the low volume of cases, training opportunities fall short in offering adequate preparation for the management of battlefield trauma.<br /><br />The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) must bridge this gap with new technology that offers distributed training in virtual environments using medical gaming scenarios, and with synthetic tissue that mimics characteristics of live tissue and tissue tool surgery. These five RFIs are portions of an overarching knowledge management strategy. The AFMS will access web based technology leveraging a cloud computing strategy that will link medical gaming simulations and virtual environments hosted on Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) certified server(s). Performance metrics will be created, tracked and archived within an enterprise-wide Learning Management System. Broadband will be adequate to support single as well as multiplayer gaming as well as multiple user access. Content will be available in the deployed setting and by portable device. Validation research will be conducted to determine adequacy of training, skill acquisition, and clinical performance when deployed and in garrison to include impact on team training and resultant patient safety data.</p>
<p>As you prepare your response, review all RFI areas and projects. The Air Force desires that the web based system components be compatible and interoperable.<br /><br />Five RFI Areas</p>
<p>1. Medical Training Virtual Environments <br />2. Medical Gaming <br />3. Learning Management System<br />4. Synthetic Tissue Model <br />5. Virtual Reality with Haptic Feedback</p>
<p>Responders can provide a response for a single RFI, all five RFIs, or any combination thereof. Each RFI will contain a clear response to each of the desired capabilities (referred to as Key Performance Parameters and Key System Attributes). Desired capabilities are explained in greater depth in paragraph 4 below. Responses to this RFI are due by 4 PM (1600) CDT, four weeks from the date of posting.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are applicable in their entirety to each of the five RFI without exception!</p>
<p>1. SUBJECT: The Air Force Medical Information Test Bed (AFMISTB) is conducting market research for an AFMM&amp;S technology research and development program capability that will provide AFMS personnel validated, standardized and effective strategic, tactical, and operational training world-wide via virtual learning environments and using realistic synthetic tissue models.</p>
<p>2. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation for a proposal or quote from the DoD or the United States Air Force (USAF). Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the government as such nor will they be considered by the Government as a binding contract.</p>
<p>Responders may submit RFIs on as many of the five areas as they choose; however, they must submit a single response for each RFI area they are responding to. Respondents are solely responsible for any and all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled in accordance with existing business practices. It will be assumed by the government that a responder has legal right to use the technology or other elements of their response without restriction. Information provided as a response to the RFI will not be returned to the originator, but will be protected as proprietary information. Other than questions associated with this RFI, AFMISTB will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future RFIs, RFQs, or RFPs associated with information outside the scope of the AFMM&amp;S Program.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: The Air Force Medical Support Agency Requirements Division (AFMSA/SG5R) has identified a need for the development of synthetic tissue and virtual learning environments at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels of Air Force medical operations. This strategy is conducive to recruiting and delivering training to a generation of Americans who grew up in the digital age. To provide this required capability within the context of the above operational environment and the Surgeon General's intent, it is imperative the AFMS develop and implement a course of action for an AFMM&amp;S technology research and development program.</p>
<p>Traditional methods of providing medical readiness, currency, sustainment, team, and graduate medical education training in central locations are insufficient for the scope, complexity, and flexibility of required medical knowledge, expertise and technical proficiency. Specifically there is a shortage of standardized training curriculum, trainers, funds, time allocated for training, and lack of effective means to expose trainees to appropriate learning situations. Increased use of modeling and simulation by the military services and the field of medicine and surgery has become an integral means to overcome these barriers. Research has also shown that virtual environments provide an immersive learning experience and, when coupled with haptic (tactile) feedback, can simulate real life situations and teach learners how to plan and manage potential complications. Medical gaming has been shown to improve cognitive function and critical thinking skills. Also, synthetic tissue development that mimics biological functions can augment live tissue training. A learning management system will capture all performance metrics from each system to track outcome measures over time.</p>
<p>AFMISTB is seeking information about academic, prototypical, developmental, foreign, and domestic commercially available products that meet or can be readily modified to meet the requirements discussed above (and identified in each separate RFI). Anyone who can offer DIACAP approved commercial off-the-shelf (COTS),Government off-the-shelf (GOTS), or research and development (R&amp;D) options that fulfill the capabilities outlined above (and/or each of the attached RFI's) should respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>4. REQUIREMENTS: The AFMMST Program concept establishes the requirement and foundation for research, development, and operational testing of novel modeling and simulation training environments and standardized educational curricula. The concept includes, but is not limited to technologies related to standards of care for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and maintenance of clinical health problems of concern to beneficiaries of military healthcare, trauma management and aerospace expeditionary operations.</p>
<p>AFMSA/SG5R assembled a high performance team (HPT) composed of subject matter experts (SME) who identified the requirements needed to fill the capability gap. They categorized the requirements into two main groups: Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA). The KPPs are mandatory requirements while the KSAs are other key system attributes.<br />Each of the following RFIs contains a list of specific KPPs and KSAs. There is some overlap in these as Service and Joint requirements require standardization to ensure intra and interoperability among systems and standardization in both system and networking security infrastructure and procedures. Responses to an RFI should address all of the requirements identified in that particular unique set of requirements.</p>
<p>Submission should comply with "open architecture" standards to the extent practical. ANY sole or proprietary solutions must be clearly identified in the RFI response.</p>
<p>5. CONTACT INFORMATION: Response to this RFI must be submitted to Mr. James (Levie) Herndon Office Manager, AFMISTB via e-mail at levie.herndon.ctr@us.af.mil. Responses must be received on or before 4 PM (1600) CDT four weeks from the date of posting of the RFI. This RFI is not a commercial solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information.<br /><br />Please include the number and name of the RFI or RFI areas you are responding to, a point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, website information, and indicate whether the company is a foreign or US-domestic entity in the contents of the e-mail.</p>
<p>Responses should describe the company's capability to offer, field, and sustain an AFMMST Technology research and development program as characterized by the requirements addressed in the RFI.s If unable to provide an AFMMST Technology research and development program capable of meeting all identified requirements, the respondent should offer tradeoff considerations.</p>
<p>6. LATE SUBMISSIONS: Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition, nor will information provided in response to this RFI be used to exclude anyone from responding to any future requests for proposals. Communications with AFMISTB with regard to this RFI will only be permitted in writing during the RFI response period.<br />Responses to the RFI received by AFMISTB after the submittal deadline and time indicated may be considered. The respondent assumes the risk of the method of dispatch chosen. Postmarking by the submittal date and time shall not substitute for actual response receipt.</p>
<p>7. OWNERSHIP OF RESPONSE TO RFI: All informational material submitted in response to this request will become property of USAF. Physical samples will be returned to the vendor at the owner's written requests and their own expense.</p>
<p>8. RELEASE OF CLAIMS, LIABILITY, AND PREPARATION EXPENSES: Under no circumstances shall AFMISTB be responsible for any response preparation expenses, submission costs, or any other expenses, costs, or damages, of whatever nature incurred as a result of the respondent's participation in this RFI process. The respondent understands and agrees that it submits its response at its own risk and expense, and releases AFMISTB from any claim for damages or other liability arising out of the RFI process.</p>
<p>9. ERRORS IN RESPONSE: AFMISTB shall not be liable for any errors in respondent's response. The respondent is responsible for careful review of its entire response to ensure that all information is correct and complete. The respondent is liable for all errors or omissions contained in its responses.</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

In order to apply trade agreements unique to Reclamation, the contracting officer will (irrespective of any other provision or clause of this colicitation) evaluate acquisitions at or above the dollar thresholds listed in FAR 25.402(b) without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.WBR 1452.211-80  Notice of Intent to acquire Metric Products and Services - Bureau of Reclamation (Mar 1993).     (a) Metric Transition Plan.  The Department of the Interior on December 6, 1991, issued a Metric Transition Program (Part 758 Department Manual Chapter 1) to establish and describe the program's policies and responsibilities.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamaation), has developed a Metric Transition Plan to implement metrication in Reclamation.  This plan describes Reclamation's overall strategy for using the metric system, defines general requirements and procedures for carrying out the transition, and details the tasks with milestones for Reclamation offices to complete.     (b)  The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1998 (Trade Act).            1.  Section 5164 of Public Law 100-418, the Trade Act, amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.            2.  The Trade Act establishes September 30, 1992 as the implementation date (to the extent economically feasible) for Federal agencies to use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business-related activities.            3.  The Trade Act permits exceptions to the use of the metric system to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreigh competitiors are producing competing products in non-metric units.            4.  As a result of the Trade Act, the President issued Executive Order 12770 dated July 25, 1991, to implement the congressiional designation of the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.     (c)  Bureau of Reclamation Implementatiion.  As a result of the Trade Act, Reclamation will, to the maximum extent practicable, use hard conversion and soft conversion metric systems in designing its constructiion projects, eventually phasing out use of the soft conversion metric system.  Exceptions to this policy will only be made when such use is impractical, produces inefficiencies or market losses, or is not economically feasible.     (d)  Expected Results.  Reclamation expects its support of the metric system to result in increased use of the metric system by U.S. contractors, thereby increasing their ability to compete in the international marketplace.  Increasing use of the metric system by U.S. contractors will eliminate possible restrictions on their bidding in the international marketplace and will eliminate any impact of economic blocks by metric countries restricting the acceptance of non-metric products.

(a) Definitions.
IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986INA - Immigration and Nationality ActINS - Immigration and Naturalization Service SSA - Social Security AdministrationINS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements ProgramESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://uscis.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm

(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

<DESC>To be the Governments leader in acquisition services, GSA sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs. With the recent award of 15 BPAs of Office Supplies in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) and to best allocate government resources, GSA temporarily postponed Schedule 75 to new Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) offers for 24 months, effective October 1, 2010. At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program. 

*This solicitation continues to be postponed to new offers.

GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored. 

Questions regarding postponement:

<DESC><p>The goal of the Sirius Program is to create experimental Serious Games to train participants and measure their proficiency in recognizing and mitigating the cognitive biases that commonly affect all types of intelligence analysis. The research objective is to experimentally manipulate variables in Serious Games and to determine whether and how such variables might enable player-participant recognition and persistent mitigation of cognitive biases. The Program will provide a basis for experimental repeatability and independent validation of effects, and identify critical elements of design for effective analytic training in Serious Games. The cognitive biases of interest that will be examined include: (1) Confirmation Bias, (2) Fundamental Attribution Error, (3) Bias Blind Spot, (4) Anchoring Bias, (5) Representativeness Bias, and (6) Projection Bias.</p>

<p>Central Contractor Registration</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, the awardee must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award. Refusal to register shall forfeit award.</p>
<p>Due Date for Quotations</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit their quotations so that NIST receives them not later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 4, 2011. FAX quotations shall not be accepted. E-mail quotations shall be accepted at paula.wilkison@nist.gov. Please reference the RFQ number in the subject line of email communications. Offerors' quotations shall not be deemed received by the Government until the quotation is entered in the e-mail inbox set forth above.</p>
<p>Quotations shall be sent to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, Attn: Paula Wilkison, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. All offerors should ensure the RFQ number is visible on the outermost packaging.</p>
<p>Because of heightened security, FED-EX, UPS, or similar delivery methods are the preferred method of delivery of quotes. If quotes are hand delivered, delivery shall be made on the actual due date through Gate A, and a 48 hour (excluding weekends and holidays) prior notice shall be provided to Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist on 301-975-8448.</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Quotation Preparation Instructions</p>
<p>1) Price Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the completed price schedule. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The pricing quotation shall be separate from any other portion of the quotation. The offeror should propose a firm-fixed-price, FOB Destination, for each CLIN. Contractor shall state express warranty coverage. Price quotations shall remain valid for a period of 90 days from the date quotations are due.<br />2) Technical Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the technical quotation. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The technical quotation shall address the following: <br />Technical Capability: The offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model. The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature. If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included. The Offerors shall acknowledge that NIST will not store the equipment onsite before it is installed.</p>
<p>Accuracy: It be demonstrated with performance data, such that a 1 point performance evaluation can be demonstrated to be sufficient to achieve 1 standard deviation (SD) or better accuracy (defined below) for a 2 year period with maximum consumption of one standard-sized tank or less of a performance evaluation gas.</p>
<p>The preferred demonstration method requires a minimum of two reference gases. Both reference gases must satisfy the requirements given below for gas concentration standards. For performance evaluation/demonstration purposes, one reference gas may be designated as the calibration standard and one as the observation gas. The concentration of the observation or test gas should be chosen to have long term concentration stability as demonstrated by an independent method. (A second gas satisfying similar requirements to those of the calibration standard but having a different concentration within the instrumental range is acceptable.)</p>
<p>Instrument recalibration using the calibration gas may occur at daily or longer intervals. Longer intervals for recalibration are advantageous from the standpoint of calibration gas consumption.</p>
<p>In addition, the instruments must be demonstrated to be robust to fluctuations in their operating environment and ambient atmospheric conditions, including water vapor concentration fluctuations in the test gas. The preferred method of demonstrating robustness to ambient conditions is field operations for 1 to 2 years, with demonstrated combined measurement uncertainty at the 95% confidence level as determined by an independent, established measurement system (e.g., NOAA Global Monitoring Division tall tower continuous or flask-based measurements).</p>
<p>Alternative demonstrations of long-term accuracy will be considered if they can show the ability of the instruments to create a long-term regional measurement network with post-calibration combined uncertainty across the network of 1 SD or less.</p>
<p>Gas Concentration Standards: A clearly documented and immediate path of traceability of measurement results to U.S. national gas concentration standards, traceability to NIST, or to gas concentration standards provided by the Global Monitoring Division, Earth Systems Research Laboratory, NOAA, Boulder, CO.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>The use of calibration gases to achieve the accuracy requirements required is not acceptable for the purposed of determining the accuracy of measurements.</p>
<p>Instrument recalibration using the calibration gas may occur at daily or longer intervals. Longer intervals for recalibration are advantageous from the standpoint of calibration gas consumption.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC><p>The following clarifications are provided by the Government on 21 Mar 11 in response to questions from multiple vendors.&nbsp; Also attached in word format for ease of reading.<br /><br />Question #1<br />Is the government requiring (or is it merely requesting) a system that is ultra low latency, less than (&lt;) 1 sec, in order to overcome this difficulty?" <br />Government Response: In addition-"latency" in the command/control of the hardware and monitoring of the video shall not exceed 100ms".</p>
<p>Question #2<br />Will AES 256 be a requirement added to the current performance specifications?<br />Government Response: 256 bit AES encryption is required.</p>
<p>Question #3</p>
<p>Are there any compliance requirements in relation to EMI with a co-located payload on the TARS aerostat?</p>
<p>Government Response: Camera system and comm. link must be able to operate, i.e., be interoperable with all TARS equipment and systems. This includes the L-Band L-88A air surveillance radar. TARS should not affect the camera/comm system and the camera/comm system should not affect TARS. It is the Gov't's intent to not have the camera/comm. systems installed in direct line of sight of the transmitting radar antenna; however, they will be within close proximity (only so much real estate on an 420K aerostat).</p>
<p><br />Question #4:</p>
<p>Is there a requirement for the transmitter to have an FCC Type ID, or is this going to operate in the military frequency band?</p>
<p><br />Is the equipment going to be operated by military, or is there a requirement for FCC licensing/coordination?</p>
<p>Government Response: We are looking for a commercial off the shelf type system that is already FCC approved (there are several 802.11 approved systems out there as well as 802.16 WiMax systems that have been approved). High gain directional antenna for BP station with a high gain omni antenna on the aerostat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Question #5:</p>
<p>Please verify the link distance from the Aerostat to the ground station is up to 35km?</p>
<p>Government Response: The distance between EGP and the EGP-South BP station is actually 36.2 km.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
As a result of this modification/amendment the solicitation closing date has hereby been&nbsp;extended to 28 Mar 11; 4pm Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quotes will be accepted via email only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit&nbsp;via email to Karin Walls; ACC AMIC/PKA, <a href="mailto:karin.walls@langley.af.mil">karin.walls@langley.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; Fax responses will not be accepted.&nbsp; It is recommended you call to verify your submission has been received by the deadline.<br />

<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations:<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

<DESC>This modification corrects a typing error in paragraph B. 1. of the announcement.  The revised paragraph is below in its entirety.<br><br>1.	Technical Description:  The AATD seeks proposals to advance technologies in rotorcraft durability and damage tolerance analysis, design, qualification and life management.  Efforts focusing on rotorcraft structural integrity technologies such as: probabilistic failure initiation and progression analysis methods to estimate remaining life; improved analysis techniques for metallic and composite rotating and non-rotating structure; mission based probabilistic life predictions to allow for probability of success predictions based on vehicle current state and anticipated mission; and improved load and usage spectrum development techniques.  Also sought are proposals in damage tolerance based design, qualification and life management technologies; durability structural concepts including repair techniques; and high-strain capable structural concepts through advanced design, analysis and/or material solutions.   Significant work has already been done to develop the Integrated Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (IRDT) methodology; however, additional maturation of the underlying technologies that support this methodology is necessary, as well as proposed D&DT techniques, concepts, validation strategies, and potential improvements in weight and operational availability will be considered in evaluating the concepts.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by interested vendors and clarify the requirement. <strong>Quote submission has been extended to 14 March 2011, 12:00 pm Alaskan Daylight Time.</strong></p>
<p>1. Do you have a picture of the board you need?<br />Answer: Yes, pictures of the frame have been attached to this solicitation. <br /><br />2. The specifications given for the LED board references "Proline 100 Software", which is used for boards manufactured by Fair-Play/Translux. Are you limiting the solicitation to just this one manufacturer or will you accept alternate manufacturers providing they meet the other specifications?<br />Answer: Alternate manufacturers are acceptable. <br /><br />3. The pixel matrix is listed as 432x 64 which I assume should read 32x64?<br />Answer: Yes, it should read 32x64.<br /><br />4. I wanted to know if an equivalent was acceptable.<br />Answer: Yes, equivalent items are acceptable. <br /><br />5. Can you use ethernet instead of a phone modem?<br />Answer: No, a modem hook up is at the existing frame.<br /><br />6. Is the sign in the bid an outdoor sign? <br />Answer: Yes. <br /><br />7. Will the bid be awarded as all or nothing? <br />Answer: Yes.<br /><br />8. Will the bid be awarded to only 1 company for both installation and supplying the sign? <br />Answer: Yes, only one company will be awarded a contract for the removal of the existing LED board and installation of a&nbsp;new LED Board.<br /><br />9. Can we just bid on the sign and not the install portion of the work? <br />Answer: No, a quote for just the sign will be considered non-responsive. <br /><br />10. How is the sign installed? On a monument? On a pole? Etc.<br />Answer: The LED Board is on an existing rectangular wooden frame outdoors. <br /><br />11. Is electrical and communication cable currently at the sign site? <br />Answer: Yes.<br /><br />12. The specifications state: 432 x 64 pixel matrix with a 35 mm pitch. However, given these specifications, there is a discrepancy, the dimensions of the sign would be 88.1" H x 595.2" W, however, the Cabinet Dimensions specified is 51" H x 92" W. Can you please clarify these specifications? <br />Answer: 432x64 is a typo; the correct pixel matrix is 32x64. <br /><br />13. What is the maximum area that is available to fit the LED Sign?<br />Answer: The existing inside dimensions are 4'3"(H), 7'8" (W) and 8" in depth. <br /><br />14. Will you be considering alternate pixel sizes?<br />Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>For clarification: This purchase is for <strong>brand name or equal products</strong>. The LED Board is to be placed inside an existing wooden rectangular frame located outdoors by an intersection. The maximum space inside the frame is 4'3"(H), 7'8" (W) and 8" in depth. This space is for one double-sided LED Board; there is no divider on the frame between the existing boards. The pixel size can vary according to the manufacturer, as long as characters on the Board can be readable from passing vehicles. The software that is installed with the board must be PC-compatible, Apple software cannot be accepted. For weather considerations; installation shall take place No Later Than 31 May 2011 with coordination by the end user. <br /><br />Any further questions can be emailed to SrA Bethany Carlan at <a href="mailto:bethany.carlan@elmendorf.af.mil">bethany.carlan@elmendorf.af.mil</a>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />HM0210-11-T-0001<br />Future Commercial SAR Integration (FCSI)<br />Revised: 17 March 2011&nbsp;
<p><br />A. INTRODUCTION<br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is investigating various architectures that will enable NGA to acquire and distribute Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to NGA. The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify current and potential capabilities, potential sources, and conduct market research to help determine commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system-level capabilities.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to this RFI. Data will not be returned. This RFI does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>No determination regarding requirements has been made at this point. Any effort that may result from this market research is not anticipated to begin until Government Fiscal Year 2013 or beyond. It is anticipated that additional information will be requested from industry and will be provided to industry in order to gather additional market research. These requests for information will be announced separately.</p>
<p><br />B. INFORMATION REQUESTED<br /><br />NGA is interested in learning about your current commercial satellite SAR imagery downlink, processing, and dissemination capabilities that could enable the ability to provide a large number of scenes quickly to a large number of users. The responses to this RFI should address how the respondent would meet all three areas and any additional information your feel is relevant. All assumptions made in developing the response should be stated.</p>
<p>Three areas: Respondents are requested to provide the following information:<br /><br />(1) Ground receiving-processing station designs. <br /><br />a. Describe the required hardware and software (COTS and custom) to receive and process your company's downlinked raw radar data for the following quantities of imagery per year: 1,000; 5,000; 10,000; or 15,000. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost (including HW, SW, and any station annual service fees).<br /><br />b. For the hardware and software described above in (a) please indicate (in hours) what the optimum timeframe is from receipt at site to data available to user.<br /><br />c. Describe your concept of operations for tasking from and downlinking to multiple user-provided ground stations. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost for implementing the concept of operations (including HW, SW, and any station annual service fees).<br /><br />d. Describe any current or potential interoperability between your sites and other commercial vendor sites. <br /><br />e. Describe current or planned capabilities for collection request submission based on a time-reserved or other basis.</p>
<p>(2) Information services requirements. <br /><br />a. Describe concept of operations to improve ability to provide: (1) acquisition of new imagery, archived imagery, provisional collections; (2) various collection modes, late or priority tasking, and expedited processing and downlink and processing to your site<br /><br />b. Describe any alternatives to purchasing which are cost-efficient for volume purchases.<br /><br />c. Describe availability of imagery license(s) for NGA covering DoD and Title 50 <br />agencies (50 USC 401a) and license levels. Describe conditions which users have no restrictions on use and distribution of generated derived products from the licensed data. <br /><br />d. Describe if actions and products such as data streaming and analyst annotated products would be subject to license restrictions. In addition, describe what type of actions or products would not fall within the current license restrictions.<br /><br />e. Describe any commercial relationships for coordinating commercial imagery purchases with other SAR or EO commercial vendors.</p>
<p>(3) Architectures.<br /><br />a. Describe any approaches to reducing collection planning and submission time. Approaches may include direct user interface with a planning database or tools which would permit the user to provide task requests.<br /><br />b. Describe approaches to providing help desk/Engineering type support to a limited set of power users.<br /><br />c. Describe approaches for vendor collection plans to be discoverable by NGA <br />architecture to support feasibility/collection planning.<br /><br />d. Describe approaches for NGA architecture to have access to vendor archives.</p>

(161 sq. km.).<br />Geology: Barbuda lies near the outer edge of the Caribbean Plate. On a regional scale, seismic events are principally associated with a subduction zone at the junction of the Caribbean Plate and the North American Plate. There is also a concentration of intra-plate activity in the Leeward Islands where the subduction of the Barracuda Rise imposes additional stresses. There are active volcanoes on the nearby islands of Montserrat, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. These conditions produce the likelihood of tsunami generating earthquakes.<br />Natural Hazards: Hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and storm surge<br />The following services are required: Contractor shall provide professional earth work and excavation services necessary to install a sea level monitoring station. Proper site preparation, backfilling and grading are necessary for the government to install a concrete pile foundation to support an elevated equipment platform. Contractor shall provide labor and equipment in the placement of four concrete piles necessary to construct a concrete pile foundation. Contractor shall provide earth trenching and concrete cutting services to install approximately one hundred (100) feet of pipe below ground. This pipe will become a conduit for water level sensor cables and tubes connected between water level measuring sensors (mounted beneath the wooden dock) to the sea level monitoring station's elevated equipment platform. Contractors shall accomplish all work required in accordance with the approved project drawings and construction specifications. <br />Contractors shall secure permission and obtain all required permits from the proper governing authorities for proper execution and completion of the work.<br />It is the Contractor's responsibility to ascertain that the Contract Documents are in accordance with applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, building codes and rules and regulations.<br /><br />Completion time for this project is 90 calendar days after award.

<DESC><p>The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential small business sources capable of providing Protective Service Officers (PSO) services throughout the state of North Carolina. A PSO is the equivalent of an Armed Guard II as set forth in the Department of Labor (DOL) Directory of Occupations. The information requested by this Sources Sought may be used within the FPS to facilitate acquisition planning and will not be disclosed outside of the Government. The Contractor will be required to provide and maintain all management, supervision, manpower, training, equipment, supplies, licenses, permits, certificates, insurance, pre-employment screenings, reports, files and any other resources necessary to accomplish the security services. The contract will require a facility security clearance. PSOs will be required to be armed and some posts may require screening of visitors using x-rays/magnetometers. All personnel supporting the contract will be required to meet FPS training, certification, suitability standards and the security services to be provided will include:</p>
<p>Basic Services - Basic services are the permanent ongoing services specifically included in the task order(s) at time of award or added through modification up to any established maximums identified in the contract.</p>
<p>Temporary Additional Services - During the term of the contract, the Government may have requirements for temporary additional services (TAS) beyond the basic services requirements. TAS are the short term, non-recurring needs for service such as an increase in hours to an existing or subsequently added post to include the weekend where a public demonstration is taking place over the weekend, addition of posts to provide for increased security for special events or high profile visitor to the building, extension of existing post hours in a building to cover seasonal fluctuations (such as at an IRS building during tax season), etc. Due to the nature of TAS the Contractor may be required to perform these services with little advance notice.</p>
<p>Emergency Security Services - The Contractor shall furnish fully qualified PSOs, management, supervision, equipment, supplies and any other cost for sustained emergency surge security force services. Deployments may be to large and small-scale events such as natural disasters, civil disturbances, or other unanticipated events on an as-needed basis. The requirements under "ESS" Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) shall be ordered for anywhere in the geographic area covered under this contract with little, if any advance notice. There will be no "phase-in" period for these requirements. The contractor shall have sufficient, fully qualified staff to meet all requirements ordered under the ESS CLIN at any time.</p>
<p>The training requirements to be provided by the contractor for all PSOs working under this effort can be broken down into four categories:</p>
<p>One Time Only<br />40 hour Basic Training<br />Initial Weapons Training<br />Orientation Training<br />Supervisor Training</p>
<p><br />Annual<br />AED<br />CPR<br />Less-Than-Lethal Weapons (i.e. Baton/OC Spray)</p>
<p>Semi-Annual<br />Weapons</p>
<p>Every Three Years<br />First-Aid<br />Refresher Training</p>
<p>This acquisition is for approximately 216,000 hours of basic service, 16,800 hours of temporary additional services and 12,000 hours of emergency security services per year. There are an estimated 104 guards protecting approximately 78 posts at over 60 buildings. The estimated value of this contract is between $5M and $10M per year.</p>
<p>For purposes of the Sources Sought, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561612 and the small business size standard is $18.5 million. If your firm is capable of providing the requirements described in this Sources Sought, please provide capability information using the attached project form via email to Margie Cox Marvel (215-521-3113), MargaretMary.CoxMarvel@dhs.gov by March 25, 2011 at 1500 EST.

<p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for the sole purpose of conducting market research and to obtain additional information regarding potential solutions to achieve Enterprise VoIP Service goals. The purpose is to identify possible services available in the marketplace from responsible contractors to the extent needed by the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide a full range of voice related capabilities to over 2.7 million DoD users from central locations that fully leverage the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) and Internet Protocol (IP) technologies. The purpose is to avoid the duplication of costs for voice services, operations and maintenance, network operations, sustainment and information assurance at nearly 2,000 locations worldwide with a lower total cost of ownership. The purpose is to eliminate multiple networks and duplicative services at Base/Camp/Post/Stations (B/C/P/S); centrally locate Video and Voice over Internet Protocol (VVoIP) Local Session Controllers; reduce the footprint of Military Departments (MILDEP) base infrastructure (operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), space, personnel and costs); leverage DISN transport whereby the MILDEPs invest in bandwidth and diversity in lieu of telecom equipment; support migration to centralized secure VoIP and access to Internet Service Providers (ISP) offerings that replace the distributed legacy TDM technology interfaces to the Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN); sustain survivability via regionalization; consolidate and integrate Information Assurance (IA) security and network operations into a single infrastructure; provide enterprise voice conferencing with automatic scheduling, 911 emergency notifications (enterprise and during site isolation from the core), and provide tighter integration with DISA enterprise collaboration and directory services. For tools, the purpose is to identify possible Unified Capabilities product suites in the marketplace available from responsible contractors to the extent needed by the Department of Defense to enable information dominance end-to-end for both fixed and tactical missions. Accordingly, contractors that can provide VoIP services which has been developed and is commercially available, are invited to submit their capabilities information for market research purposes.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Assured SATCOM Services In Single Theater (ASSIST)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Request for Information<br /></strong><br /><br /><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency, Procurement and Logistics,<br />DITCO-Scott, 2300 East Drive Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406 <br />
<p><strong><br />Purpose:</strong> The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information regarding an end-to-end Ka- and Ku- commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) capability for Department of Defense theater specific operations.&nbsp; This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment for an RFP in the future.&nbsp; This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.&nbsp; Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> COMSATCOM is an essential communications component for in-theater operations.&nbsp; The USCENTCOM theater of operations incurs the greatest amount of COMSATCOM usage, using Ku-band service on more than 20 different commercial communications satellites, mostly through the use of base period leases (typically single-year) with additional option year leases.&nbsp; Leases range from small fractions of a Transponded Equivalent (TPE) to multiple TPEs with an aggregate sustained demand of over 5 GHz of service and more than 1,200 terminal links/accesses.</p>
<p>With the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 President's Budget Request, the DoD is preparing for an FY12-FY14 investment to acquire long-term satellite communications services in the Ka- and Ku-bands, preferably on a single satellite, to meet COCOM theater demand, directing as many future users and migrating as many existing users as possible from Ku to Ka-band.&nbsp; (Per Appendix A, Ground Tactical demand is envisioned migrating to Ka-band whereas AISR Demand will remain at Ku-band.)&nbsp; The investment includes both the space segment and associated terminals.&nbsp; Initially, the DoD goal is to reduce costs for COMSATCOM capability in the CENTCOM theater of operations.&nbsp; In the future, DoD requires the flexibility of moving these services to other theaters of operation as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options including possible use of the General Services Administration (GSA) Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132-54, Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity, which was established as part of the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) to acquire the space segment service.&nbsp; DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options for acquiring, or modifying terminals and other necessary user equipment including possible use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-3, 132-4, 132-8, and/or 132-9; the new GSA Custom SATCOM Solutions (CS2) and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts scheduled to be available by 4th Quarter FY2011; or another existing DoD contract focused on terminals and user equipment.</p>
<p><strong>[Note that Schedule 70 has an open enrollment provision, allowing interested vendors to apply at any time.&nbsp; The timeline to receive a Schedule 70 contract is typically four (4) months from submission of a complete proposal.&nbsp; Please see www.gsa.gov/schedule70 and www.gsa.gov/fcsa for further details.]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The budgeted cost for the service is $440 million to include service operations and initial terminal modifications and replacements to use the space segment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is seeking the following capabilities from this COMSATCOM service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Primary services supported at Ka frequencies (20.2-21.2 GHz on the downlink, 30.0-31.0 GHz on the uplink). The DoD will consider all industry solutions for securing orbital and frequency authorization and will assist with any approach deemed feasible based upon US domestic and international regulatory requirements. Industry would be solely responsible for obtaining licensing and orbital allocation using their normal process.<br /><br />-At least enough space resources to meet the current commercial SATCOM demand described in Appendix A. The objective is double demand documented in Appendix A with theater area beams.</p>
<p>-Service is available for use starting no later than 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>-Ability to support multiple changes to the theater of operation for the service over the lifetime of the lease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix A contains a summary of the current commercial SATCOM demand characteristics that make up the current Ku-band leases (Scenario #1). In addition, data is also provided about the currently deployed in-theater terminal population accessing these COMSATCOM services. An alternative scenario (Scenario #2) is also described to assess system extensibility.</p>
<p>Information Requested: The following questions are intended to help structure the acquisition of the stated COMSATCOM capability, including space segment service and terminals. Questions are intended to enable DoD to refine its strategy for this commercial SATCOM capability.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical<br />T1.</strong>What Ka-band and Ku-band services do you already have planned (or could provide) by the service start date? What is the design and on-orbit pedigree of the capability? What is the expected design and operating life?<br /><strong>T2.</strong>Assuming that the services you provide are initially to support the user population in Appendix A, Scenario 1, but later the services must be moved to another theater to support the user population shown in Appendix A, Scenario 2, what percentage of each Scenario's requirements do you estimate could be met with such a system or service? <br /><strong>T3.</strong>Describe the coverage, polarization, and bandwidth assignments of your proposed solution. Can the 30.0-31.0 GHz up / 20.2-21.2 GHz down gateway links be steerable? If so, how many can be supported? <br /><strong>T4.</strong>To what extent can some or all of the theatre Ka- and Ku-band coverages be steered to facilitate optimized service after repositioning? Can that Ka-band coverage be segmented and steered independently? <br /><strong>T5.</strong>What are the satellite station keeping requirements to achieve the forecasted performance of your solution?<br /><strong>T6.</strong>What terrestrial infrastructure (terminals, gateways, DoD gateways, network operations center (NOCs), hubs, terrestrial connectivity) is required to deliver your projected performance? Please include details on number of gateways required, number of terminals, connectivity, topology, terminal technical characteristics, polarization, use of multiple frequency bands to terminate user links, etc.)? Specify any assumptions you make.<br /><strong>T7.</strong>Describe the interoperability of your service with planned DoD military Ka-band systems (e.g., terminals that meet MIL-STD-188-164 and modems that meet MIL-STD-188-165.) To what extent would the performance discussed in T1 change if you were to rely exclusively on planned DoD Ka-band terminals and the planned modem inventory? (The WGS terminal population predominantly operates RHCP on the uplink and LHCP on the downlink with an axial ratio of &lt; 2dB. Select coverage areas on the WGS satellite are also capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, non-simultaneously. Select DoD Ka-band terminal types are capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, again, non-simultaneously.)<br /><strong>T8.</strong>Describe the major components of the system and service (e.g., satellite, gateways, terminals, modems, hubs, NOCs)? Describe the assumptions and function of each component and the extent to which forecasted performance is dependent on each component's characteristics to achieve the system performance forecast. <br /><strong>T9.</strong>Using the information in Appendix A, specify any user equipment changes needed. Include the estimated number of terminals that will need to be replaced. For new and replacement terminals, provide size, weight, and power demands of the equipment and any ruggedized characteristics of the equipment. To what extent does the performance of your solution require homogeneous terminal sizes/performance? What are the practical limits on diverse terminal sizes on your solution? To what extend is the performance of your solution dependent upon a specified connectivity type (e.g., hub-spoke only)? What is the impact to the performance if the service must support hub-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh connectivity.<br /><strong>T10.</strong>What terminals, modems, and network equipment are available that provide end-to-end service for your solution? From what sources can this equipment and terminals be procured?<br /><strong>T11.</strong>Describe the operations and control plan for your service including the location of the control facilities. Describe the process for a user to request and obtain service. Describe the security features that could be made available from that control facility. What tools would be necessary for the Government to provide payload configuration direction? Are those tools included in your solution and price estimates? Describe the functions and staffing of any NOC used for operations of comparable commercial systems.<br /><strong>T12.</strong>What are the information assurance features or characteristics of your service (e.g., TT&amp;C link encryption, network controls)? How compliant is it with the MAC I IA controls specified for GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54? (See Appendix B).<br /><strong>T13.</strong>Is your service capable of meeting the "Terms and Conditions Applicable to <br />Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity (Special Item Number 132-54)"? (See 08_Proposal Price List Preparation document within Schedule 70 solicitation - http://www.gsa.gov/schedule70.) <br /><strong>T14.</strong>Describe your plan, including any steps requiring DoD activity, for gaining orbital slot approval for the space segment. What are the regulatory considerations and what is their impact on schedule? Cost considerations?</p>
<p><strong>Funding/ Contracting Mechanisms<br />F1.</strong>Provide a ROM total cost and the percentage for each cost element for your proposed solution.<br /><strong>F2.</strong>What are your standard payment practices for your proposed service? Are there specific payment models that you would recommend? Are there constraints should payment not occur until service delivery?<br /><strong>F3.</strong>What are your standard service agreements for leases of this duration? What arrangements do you enter into with commercial customers to provide them the assurance that you will deliver the service over the entire lease assuming full payment occurs no later than 2018?<br /><strong>F4.</strong>Assuming the last increment of funding is dispersed after successful service activation and the contractor will provide satellite operations for a period beyond that date, how does the Government ensure its service level agreement over that period between last payment and service end date is met (e.g., a liquidated damages clause (i.e., Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.211-11))? If so, what would be the possible terms and structure of such a liquidated damages clause?<br /><strong>F5.</strong>The Government is exploring the use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 for acquiring space segment services. For the associated terminals, please describe your preferred contracting mechanism - GSA IT Schedule 70, or the CS2 and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts, or another existing DoD contract - for terminal leasing, procurement or modification and installation. From what other contracts or sources can these terminals be procured?<br /><br /><strong>Schedule<br />S1.</strong>The desired date from service activation is 31 December 2014; describe your plan to meet this schedule. What is the necessary contract award date to accomplish this? Ensure service test and checkout prior to Government acceptance of the service is included in your schedule.<br /><strong>S2.</strong>Describe the timeline for terminal and user equipment contract award to delivery and installation of equipment.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 5.203, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District issues the below synopsis of work. This announcement is not a solicitation and represents upcoming construction work.<br /><br />This synopsis is for a firm fixed price construction requirement at Joint Base Pearl Harbor - Hickam on Oahu, Hawaii. Solicitation for this work is anticipated to be issued&nbsp;on 8 April 2011 of this year with proposals due on 16 May 2011. This work will be competitively issued as a Small Business set-aside&nbsp;Invitation for&nbsp;Bids (IFB) utilizing Sealed Bidding procedures.&nbsp; Bidders must submit sealed bids to be opened at the time and place stated in the solicitation; bids will be evaluated without discussions.&nbsp; The NAICS Code for this project is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Small Business size standard for this NAICS code is $33.5 Million average annual revenue. Magnitude of construction is between $10 Million and $25 Million. The project constitutes the construction of an F-22 Munitions Storage Complex for the Air National Guard (ANG), and includes site work, construction of cast-in-place concrete structures for munitions storage, and maintenance. Up to four structures will be earth-covered. Up to two structures will have earth filled walls. Two structures will be partially steel framed with metal exteriors. The project site is within Quantity Distance Arcs for existing munitions storage sites.

Justification Review Document

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  VA Black Hills, Fort Meade, SD

2.  Description of Action:  A Firm Fixed-Price contract is contemplated for acquisition of construction services for an emergency relocation of the Bldg 148 G-ward Nursing Home control door.   

3.  Description of Commodities:  Work consists of soliciting services from North Central Supply to install a new control door and  automatic door opener providing access to the Bldg 148 G-ward Nursing Home unit.  The automatic door opener needs to be integrated with the relocation of an existing secure care/wanderguard system.

4.  Statutory Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)  Only one responsible source

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  The secure care /wanderguard system currently installed on the subject control door has recurring nuisance alarms and has been shut down.  The VA staff have been unable to troubleshoot the problem.  North Central Supply was contacted to diagnose the problem as they  are the primary door hardware and metal door manufacturer in the Black Hills Region. They have completed similar work at the VA in the past as a subcontractor under competitively awarded contracts.  Due to the geographic location of the Black Hills region, the source of supply for this type of service is limited.  It has been our experience that soliciting for this service from general contractors results in a subcontract to North Central Supply to supply and install the door hardware.  Awarding to a general contractor results in added cost to the government in the form of overhead and profit charged by the general contractor.  It is in the best interest of the government to contract directly with North Central Supply, a women-owned, small business, to complete the work required.
 
Therefore, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Statutory Authority 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) is being cited.

6. Sources Solicited:  North Central Supply was contacted to diagnose the problem based on our previous experience with their services and the fact that they are the primary door/door hardware supply warehouse in the local area. They are familiar with the facility, have recently completed like work, and are familiar with the necessary interfaces with the secure care system.  They have diagnosed the problem, recommended a solution and are able to proceed with ordering materials and installation pending approval to proceed.

7.  Market Research Conducted:  Due to limited sources of supply in the geographical area, a minimal Market Survey was completed.  North Central Supply is the primary door/door hardware supply warehouse in the local area and is capable of completing the work in a timely manner.  North Central Supply is a women owned, small business. 

8. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The following reasons are cited for using the selected vendor, North Central Supply as a sole source vender:  

	North Central Supply is both a hardware supplier and an installer and can supply, install and test the required door, hardware, and operators.  Utilizing a general contractor in this particular case adds unnecessary delay and cost. 

	North Central Supply has completed similar work at this location in the past as a subcontractor and has been successful in resolving similar issues as they have the technical expertise.  The new door, hardware and operators are being installed in an existing frame thus most of the work will need to be customized to the existing conditions. Since North Central Supply custom manufacturers the doors, they have that capability themselves.

10.  Actions to remove Barriers to Competition: Any new secure care/ wander guard door systems will when possible be evaluated for errant noise before installation. New electronic equipment will be evaluated for noise contribution and impact on secure care/wander guard equipment.

11.  Fair and Reasonable Price:  The quoted price of $15,516.75 is fair and reasonable as compared to the government estimate. 
 
12.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  Based upon the information provided herein, I believe the justification for awarding this project to North Central Supply on a sole-source basis is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and recommend we proceed as such.
