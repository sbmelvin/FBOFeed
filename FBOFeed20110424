<DESC>HELICOPTER OPERATIONS SUPPORT TRAILERDue date for quotes has been extended to April 30, 2011.This is also an advance notice of an amendment that will be issued on or about April 15, 2011, which will include changes to the following clauses: - Update B.1 - change wording from "...all-risk.." to "...all hazard..." in opening paragraph. - Update C.1 - due to change in Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-47 - Update D.2 - units offered under this solicitation can be either a self-propelled unit or a unit hauled by a transport vehicle - Update D.2 - D.2.1.3,#8 - the requirements for the generator will be 10,000 watts (10kw) - Update D.2 - D.2.1.4,#8 - the AM and FM radios are required to have the same frequency ranges as stated at D.2.1.4 #2 and #3  - Update E.3 - due to change in Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48 - Update Exhibit D - Wage Determination No. 1995-0221, to Revision No. 26, dated 11/18/2010NOTE:  At this time, based on the tentative issue date for the national amendment, I do not plan to extend the due date for quotes beyond April 30.The following questions and answers are included to become a part of the resultant agreement.  Additional questions and answers are posted in a separate document on FedBizOpps.Q:  I have a couple of questions on the helibase specs. One spec is for a Whisper Quiet generator. That is a brand name. Is the spec saying that the generator must be that brand or is it a general sound requirement.  If it is a sound requirement what decibel ratting is whisper quiet?. Also, the size of the generator that you are requiring is going to need its own trailer. How are we going to get paid for transportation to and from the fire with two tow vehicles (one for the trailer and one for the generator trailer)?A:  If you search the internet for whisper quiet generators you get more than one brand.  You are required to meet the specification listed while providing whisper quiet technology.  The specification at D.2.1.3, #8 external generator, should have stated 10,000 watts (10kw). Q:  The last spec that is confusing is the 2 AM and 2 FM portable radios. As written, it sounds like I just need to go to Wal-Mart and pickup a couple of Walkmans. If the spec is intended to be for communication radios it needs to specify what frequencies the radios need to broadcast. A:  Please refer to D.2.1.4, #8  Two (2) AM and two (2) FM handheld radios.  CLARIFICATION:  For frequencies, follow the frequency ranges for the AM radio in #3 of this specification (i.e., 118-137) and #2 for the FM radio of this specification (i.e., 406-420) Q:  Im hoping to bid on the Helicopter Support Trailer solicitations coming up and I wanted to know if self-propelled units would be acceptable as well as a trailer as you have made in amendment 4 with the GIS solicitation? See copy of amendment below. Solicitation AG-024B-S-11-7001 has been amended with Amendment 4  Description:\nD.2.1.1 - I have received numerous questions if a self-propelled unit would be acceptable on this solicitation. This has been discussed with Fire and Aviation Management and either a self-propelled unit or a trailer hauled by a separate vehicle will be acceptable. All units, whether self-propelled or a trailer, will be required to meet the specifications stated in the solicitation. D.2.1.1, Type 1 and Type 2 units, the following is provided as a clarification on the license referenced at #11: ArcGIS 9.3.1 or higher to ArcView license level. However, the Vendor should have the full install of ArcGIS 9.3.1 or higher, which includes ArcEditor and ArcInfo functionality. If these additional levels of the ArcGIS suite are needed the government is responsible for providing the license to "unlock" or "activate" this additional functionality.A:  A self-propelled unit or a unit hauled by a transport vehicle will be acceptable on this solicitation.

<p>&nbsp;The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Acquisition Management Division (AMD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, on behalf of the NIST/Metallurgy Division with Oxford Instruments America, Inc. for an upgrade to an existing XRay Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy System (XEDS).</p>
<p>The Metallurgy Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the mission of promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness in the development and use of materials by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology. The Division has a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) Hitachi S4700-II that is equipped with a 5-axis fully motorized stage (X, Y and Z tilt and rotation), and is used to investigate materials in its research programs such as advanced on-chip interconnects, semiconductor nanowires, and thin film and other nano-structured materials..</p>
<p>The Division has a need to upgrade the FESEM with a state of the art XEDS system to enable compositional analysis of various (metals, ceramics, and polymeric) materials in NIST's existing research programs.</p>
<p>NIST requires an XEDS system that integrates with the existing electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) system attached to the FESEM to permit phase identification of unknown materials, combining the compositional XEDS information with crystallographic EBSD information. The existing EBSD system is a Nordlys II system, originally purchased from HKL Technology, now owned by Oxford Instruments America.</p>
<p>The required XEDS system is a commercial item. The system must be hardware and software compatible with the existing EBSD system. The ability of the Oxford INCA Energy SEM 350 XEDS to integrate with the existing Nordlys EBSD system is unique to Oxford Instruments America. The language and control hardware are proprietary in nature and are owned by Oxford. Oxford has no distributors. Oxford Instruments is the sole, responsible source that can provide an XEDS system that will integrate with the existing EBSD system, and guarantee to meet original equipment performance <br />specifications.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by April 14, 2011, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
