DRAFT
Scope of Work
For Management of Computer Delivery
Purpose
The purpose of this agreement is to provide a vehicle for receiving, storing, testing, distributing, installing, training, maintaining, and monitoring use of donated computers from the U.S. to schools in Uzbekistan in the most sustainable manner feasible, and procuring additional equipment as detailed below to fill the balance. 
Background
This program was conceived in a discussion between DPM Azimov and Aministrator Natsios in November 2001, when Azimov requested that USAID assist in equipping schools with computers.  This request was repeated during high-level meetings at the Joint Security and Cooperation Consultations in January 2002. This request was agreed to by the U.S. delegation led by Ambassador Taylor.
Of nearly 10,000 schools in Uzbekistan, about half are equipped with computers. Only 1.2 percent of these schools have Pentium class computers, and about 7 percent have 386-486 computers. The rest have Soviet computers of some 20 years ago. Three percent of all students in Uzbekistan have access to computers in their schools. Due to the age of those computers and accompanying lack of spare parts, many of these computers are not in working order. The U.S. Government has agreed to donate and ship a number of used 110/240V computers and monitors with some extras, such as cables, from the United States to Uzbekistan.
This program supports a new priority of USAID on education and youth in Central Asia, and links with a larger-scale basic education initiative now in the design phase.
Period
Arrival of the computers in Tashkent is expected in late 2002. This agreement will begin one month prior to the expected arrival of the computers and continue for 8 more months (2 months distribution + 6 months maintenance & monitoring).
Program description
The primary purpose of this program is to transfer donated used computers from the US to primary and secondary schools in Uzbekistan in pursuit of familiarizing students with computer technology and use, and connecting them to the internet where feasible.
Pre-Arrival Activities
Several procedures will need be developed, approved by USAID, and acted upon before arrival of the equipment, including: an inventory format for the equipment that will record specific details regarding distribution and working condition of each individual piece of equipment over the life of this award; a distribution plan for beneficiary schools; a Beneficiary Agreement that includes policies and procedures to which those schools must adhere; a training plan for appropriate personnel at distribution sites upon installation; and a monitoring plan for the post-distribution phase. In this pre-arrival period, the contractor will also be expected to identify sources and price quotes for additional computers, monitors, and accessories, as well as introductory computer courses and materials, along with accessories, operating system, and software.
Proposals should include a mobilization plan for the first 60 days of the activity that covers all of the activities in this ?Pre-Arrival? section. This plan should take the form of a calendar with detailed information as to when and how these various logistical issues will be managed.
Inventory format:
The contractor will develop a format for inventory of the equipment that includes fields for serial numbers, working condition, date and location of distribution, memory capacity, operating system, software installed, and dates and descriptions of repairs. This inventory should be a living document from which repair, software installation, and distribution records can be kept through life of this activity. USAID will approve the format prior to arrival of the equipment.
Distribution Plan:
The contractor will assess which schools in which communities should be potential beneficiaries of these computers, what software will be necessary, and in what quantity. This assessment will be based upon electrical reliability in the community, security considerations, and the community?s ability and willingness to adhere to the Beneficiary Agreement (outlined below). The equipment should be concentrated in the areas where USAID is already active.
Based on its assessment, the contractor will provide USAID with various potential packages for distribution of the equipment, based on packing lists that will be provided upon shipment. The packages will include which schools get which equipment, keeping in mind that each school should receive at least one of the larger-memory CPUs. The packages should also include which schools will have reliable internet access, although non-availability of internet should not preclude a school?s receiving some equipment. USAID will actively participate in the formulation of this plan, and must approve the final version (with GOU input as necessary) before distribution can begin.
Procurement:
In the event that the U.S. Government is not able to fill the order of computers from its surplus stock, the contractor will be required to procure 110/220V Pentium II personal computers (no Macs) and 110/220Vcolor monitors, UPS?s, keyboards, mice, cables, and power cords. The computers will have at least 16 MB RAM, .5 GB, and video cards. For the purposes of this proposal, bidders are to budget for 200 PCs, monitors, UPS?s, keyboards, mice, power cords, and other necessary cords and cables. Procured items need not be new, but must be in good working order, and must fit the specification noted in this paragraph.
In addition, the contractor will identify sources and obtain quotes for necessary accessories, including 500 European plugs, and 1,000 sets of Cyrillic stickers for keyboards. The packing list will provide a more detailed picture of what this procurement may entail, but the contractor should budget according to these items for the purposes of this document. Once the packing list is received, the contractor will provide a report to USAID that outlines how many computers, monitors, UPS?s and other supplementary materials (cords, cables, etc.) will be needed before delivery and installation can begin.
In this pre-arrival period, the contractor will explore possibilities for special discounts that might be offered by local internet provider for schools, especially schools in poorer, rural areas of the country. The contractor should also explore the possibility of the GOU?s subsidizing this cost to schools, especially once the period of this award is completed.
The contractor will also identify and obtain price quotes for course materials that schools and teachers will use for various levels of computer courses. Depending upon what is already installed on the computers that we receive (assuming that some are educational), USAID will work with the contractor to decide which courses to procure.
All procurement will be undertaken in accordance with the USAID Eligibility Rules for Goods and Services (attached), and budgets should reflect costs accordingly.
Beneficiary Agreement:
The contractor will develop a Beneficiary Agreement that all beneficiary schools must sign in order to receive any equipment. This Beneficiary Agreement will be approved by USAID before distribution begins. In addition to the hard and fast rule that these computers are not for resale, this agreement will include the school?s commitment to:
allow appropriate teachers to attend training on the computers;  
install only licensed software on the computers;
allow students access to the internet (where internet is available) during most school days;
adhere to policies and procedures developed by the contractor and approved by USAID;
maintain equipment after this award?s maintenance period expires;
develop a system of user fees for non-student users that will cover costs of internet access during school hours. 
Training Plan:
The contractor will develop a 2-3 day course for appropriate school personnel at the distribution site to teach basic use and maintenance practices, including efficient use of the internet where appropriate. The training should also include a reiteration of the policies and procedures to which beneficiaries will adhere, how to start and sustain user fee systems, and should introduce identified course materials.
Monitoring Plan:
The contractor will develop a separate monitoring plan for the equipment to be carried out after distribution and installation. This plan will lay out travel to each of the beneficiary schools once a month to see first hand how the computers are being used, advise the school on other perhaps more advanced uses in their particular situations, and record and resolve any problems that may have occurred with the equipment. A form for each monitoring visit will be developed upon which to record these issues, along with any online partnerships with US or other schools and any webpages created at the school. This plan and accompanying form will be approved by USAID before distribution is complete. Mention of this plan should be made in the Beneficiary Agreement. 
All pre-arrival activities should be completed by the estimated time of arrival of the equipment.
Arrival and Pre-Distribution Activities
Shipment of the donated computers to Tashkent will be arranged by USAID/CAR. Upon its arrival in Tashkent, USAID will provide letters for customs clearance. Once cleared, the contractor will take receivership of all equipment and deliver it to a storage facility with appropriate security, space, and environmental conditions for computers.
The contractor will arrange for a publicity event, perhaps at the storage facility. The event should include appropriate USAID and GOU education officials, perhaps some personnel from likely beneficiary schools, and the press. USAID and the US Embassy can be of some assistance with regard to this event, but the contractor must be prepared to take on most of the responsibility for it.
Careful, detailed inventory of the equipment, including memory capacity and software applications already installed in CPUs, and working condition of all equipment, will be recorded and supplied to the Uzbekistan Country Office and to USAID/CAR?s Contracts Office. The contractor will assure that when plugged in, all hardware is switched to 240V, and will label and test all equipment, and record in the inventory its working condition. Any damage will be noted in the inventory. Any damaged equipment will be repaired by the contractor if possible. Irreparable equipment must be noted to USAID. All necessary plug re-fitting will be the responsibility of the contractor. 
Each USG-donated CPU will arrive with an operating system installed. Other software already on the CPU is likely to vary greatly. We will not know until this testing phase which CPUs require which software, based on the distribution plan packages and the assessment of needs. Anti-virus software should be one prerequisite to any CPU before distribution. The contractor will recommend to USAID which software packages (and how many) to procure, and obtain quotes. Upon USAID approval, the contractor will procure that software and install it on the appropriate CPU, updating the inventory as software is installed. All newly procured CPUs will require operating systems, and other software packages recommended by the contractor.
The contractor will submit a list of software to be procured, and its cost, for USAID approval. This list will be based upon
the assessment of needs outlined in the previous paragraph (including the USG-donated CPUs and newly procured CPUs),
software already available (installed or uninstalled) through this donation, and 
the price quote obtained earlier.
Once procured, the contractor will load the software as per the distribution plan.
Once all software is installed and recorded on the inventory, the inventory is to be considered in its initial phase, and shall be submitted to USAID.
Based on the initial inventory, USAID and the contractor will together decide upon the final distribution plan for the equipment. At least one faster computer should be assigned to each school as possible.
Distribution, Monitoring, and Maintenance
The contractor will be responsible for distributing and installing all equipment, and seeing to appropriate electrical and security upgrades as necessary, according to the USAID-approved distribution plan. Each school must sign a Beneficiary Agreement before installation will begin. Internet connections will be established as part of the installation where appropriate, along with any appropriate networking. The contractor will also provide at least one day?s training to appropriate school personnel as to the proper usage and basic maintenance of the equipment, according to the approved training plan.
Internet access to appropriate beneficiary schools will be provided as part of this award for a period of 6 months from installation date.
Distribution, installation, and training should be complete within two months of the equipment?s arrival.
After distribution is made, the contractor is responsible for maintenance of all computer equipment for a period of six months, on an on-call basis. USAID expects the contractor to respond to repair calls within 24 hours of receiving word of malfunction. Where possible, appropriate school personnel should be on hand to observe the repair, so that they may learn to carry it out in the future, should the problem arise again. This fact will be made clear in the Beneficiary Agreements. Any equipment destroyed in this period at the beneficiary location will be reported in monitoring visit reports to USAID.
Over this final six-month period, the contractor will carry out the agreed to monitoring plan, and report to USAID monthly. USAID will conduct a review near the end of this 6-month period to assess the need to exercise the extension option.
Selection Criteria and Requirements
The implementing partner shall have a proven ability to handle high-profile projects, long-term presence, relevant experience, and commitment to the region, good track record, demonstrated organizational and administrative capacity, and necessary technical skills and expertise to achieve the goals of the program.

Offerors should note that these criteria: (1) serve as the standard against which all proposals will be evaluated, and (2) serve to identify the significant matters which offerors should address in their proposals.
EVALUATION CRITERIA: BEST VALUE
A review panel established under the direction of the Contracting Officer, USAID/CAR, will evaluate proposals.  The review panel and the Contracting Officer will use ?Best Value? criteria to determine the proposal most advantageous to the U.S. Government. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are equal to cost or price. Technical evaluation factors, and the subfactors thereof, are listed below in their relative order of importance. Contract award shall be made to the responsive and responsible offeror whose combined technical and cost factor offer the best value to the U.S. Government.
A. COST EVALUATION
The contractor should have a structure that will allow it to provide the greatest value (highest results) at the lowest cost; minimizing and/or eliminating overall administrative costs, overhead, subcontract pass-through costs, profit, international staff benefits, home office communications and support, and other non-value added costs. Each offeror's cost proposal (base period and option periods) shall be evaluated based on the following criteria in comparison with the cost proposal of other offerors:
1) Effectiveness of proposed cost control structure
Budget transparency to effectively track expenditures;
Consistency of proposed LOE, travel costs and ODCs;
Soundness of purchase and acquisition methods;
Subcontracting methods are clearly defined.
2) Cost efficiency of proposed Other Direct Costs
Offers market competitive pricing estimates of tangible items to be used for contract performance;
Competitiveness pricing and purchase methods of in-country air travel and surface transportation.
3) Reasonableness of overall proposed price
Price has not been assigned a numerical weight. Offerors are reminded that the U.S. Government is not obligated to award a negotiated contract on the basis of the lowest proposed cost (see FAR 15.101-1) or to the offeror with the highest technical evaluation score. For this procurement technical proposal is equal to cost or price relative to deciding who best might perform the work, price and other factors considered. Therefore, after the final evaluation of the proposals, the Contracting Officer will make the award to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, considering both technical and cost factors.  It should be noted that estimate cost is an important factor and its importance as an evaluation factor will increase as the degree of equality of technical competence between proposals increases.
TECHNICAL EVALUATION
1) Managerial Capacity
Demonstrates:
- capacity to establish and adhere to complicated, detailed task plans (transportation, distribution, inventories, etc.);
- capacity to manage the logistical requirements for operations in diverse locations;
- capacity to track progress of all facets of the program, provide reports which accurately present program status, and deal effectively with opportunities and problems as they arise;
- an effective system for managing subcontracts, joint-venture relationships or any other method proposed for involving the work of other firms or organizations to carry out the contract;
- capacity to manage budgets and reporting requirements in a timely manner.
Mobilization Plan.
Along with the Technical Proposal the Offeror must submit a Mobilization Plan. This plan will take the form of a calendar that will guide resources and initial activities. The mobilization plan will provide details of work to be carried out in the initial 60-day period of the contract. At a minimum, it will cover the anticipated logistics of contract start-up, the process and timing of establishing administrative and financial control systems, and pre-distribution activities outlined in the Scope of Work. It will also cover the timing of the initial deployment of all staff, and the plan for the initial activities to be executed by these staff members.

<SUBJECT>A--Alternatives for Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4) Source Term Location
<SOLNBR>DE-RA26-03NT41735
<CONTACT>Raymond Johnson, Contracting Officer, Contact Contract Specialist, johnson@netl.doe.gov;Denise Riggi, Contract Specialist, 304-285-4241, driggi@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy?s (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) announces the availability of Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) No. DE-RA26-03NT41735 entitled ?Alternatives for Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4) Source Term Location,? expected to be published on or about January 31, 2003.   The PRDA supports the mission of the Office of Science & Technology (OST), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management (EM), U.S. Department of Energy  (DOE). The objective of this procurement is to select and demonstrate innovative technologies for characterizing and quantifying the remaining carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) in the subsurface.  The DNAPL source term contamination is potentially located in both the vadose zone and saturated zone in difficult subsurface conditions and possibly acting as a continuing source to groundwater contamination. Verifying the existence of DNAPL is required to develop a long-term remediation strategy. The proposed work will be accomplished in two phases.   In the first phase, the selected vendor(s) will be expected to develop a viable conceptual model for locating the presence/absence of DNAPL in the unconfined aquifer and evaluate/propose characterization technologies to validate the model.  It is expected that one or two contractor (s) will be selected from the Phase I contractor(s) to proceed into Phase II.  The selected contractor (s) would perform in Phase II the  characterization activities proposed in Phase I to confirm the conceptual model that will describe the nature, extent and mass of the DNAPL with the objective of supporting a step-change remedial action decision. At the DOE Hanford 200 West Area, CCl4 is present in the vadose zone and groundwater.  The vadose zone and unconfined aquifer consist of a thick accumulation of unconsolidated to semi-indurated sediments composed of silts, sands, and gravels.  The water table is located at approximately 225 ft. below ground surface (bgs), and groundwater flows within a multi-aquifer system. A plume of dissolved CCl4 that resulted from past discharges extends over 11 square kilometers in the unconfined aquifer under 200 West Area. The highest concentration of CCl4 detected in the 200 West Area groundwater was approximately 8,000 ug/L.  Dissolved CCl4 has been observed deep within the unconfined aquifer (greater than 30 feet below water table) and within the uppermost confined aquifer approximately 500-ft. bgs.  Difficult conditions that hamper assessment of the plume in the 200 West Area include the complex sediment facies that control fluid transport, gravel lenses, well-cemented caliche layers, man-made obstructions (buildings, tanks, others), and extensive and deep contamination.  Costs to characterize and monitor this deep and large plume with conventional technologies such as drilling and sampling are excessive, and significant cost-savings could be realized with improved methods. In 1999 the U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (RL) requested the assistance of the Innovative Treatment Remediation Demonstration (ITRD) program to provide technical support to assist with the evaluation and selection of technologies applicable at Hanford for characterization and remediation of CCl4 contamination in ground water and the vadose zone.  A Technical Advisory Group (TAG), consisting of RL and contractor project leads, technical experts, regulators, stakeholders and Tribal representatives, was formed for this project.  The TAG identified and reviewed approximately thirty technologies they considered applicable to enhance remediation of the CCl4 contamination.  The advisory group suggested additional modeling and characterization activities to assist in developing a final recommendation for implementation of a remediation strategy for the CCl4 plume.  Early in the evaluation process, it was recognized that if DNAPL exists in the subsurface, then definition of the location and estimation of the volume of the DNAPL source was required before treatment technologies could be evaluated.  In response, the ITRD performed an initial review of characterization technologies. Examples of Innovative characterization technologies identified by the ITRD program that might be applicable to Hanford include:  direct push drilling methods such as the cone penetrometer, noninvasive methods such as geophysical technologies, DNAPL volume estimation using Partitioning Interwell Tracer Test (PITT), etc.  All of these technologies offer the advantage of locating and estimating the volume of DNAPL in the subsurface more efficiently and at a much lower cost than standard drilling methods used in the baseline approach.  A listing of the technologies evaluated in the ITRD will be made available with the solicitation. The ITRD program completed a groundwater modeling study and report of the Hanford CCl4 plume in April 2001.  The modeling, performed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), was to provide an indication of the potential impact of the CCl4 source on the compliance boundary (edge of central plateau) approximately 5,000 m from the source area.  The primary results of the modeling bracket the amount of CCl4 source that will most likely result in compliance or noncompliance at the boundary and the relative influence of the various modeling parameters.  Modeling reports will be made available with the solicitation. Currently, a Work Plan for regulatory approval is being developed to guide the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the 200-PW-1 Operable Unit (DOE/RL-2001-01, Draft B).  This Operable Unit (OU) includes the Hanford CCl4 vadose zone plume associated with the waste disposal sites and other parts of the vadose zone.  A feasibility study is planned following the RI activities to support a Proposed Plan and Record of Decision for the 200-PW-1 OU Waste Sites and the CCl4 vadose zone plume by 2006.  The 200-PW-1 RI consists of two major parts: (1) a known source term waste site characterization effort which is focused on improving the understanding of the vertical distribution of CCl4 and radionuclides in the vadose zone beneath the waste sites, and (2) a dispersed CCl4 vadose zone plume characterization focused on identifying previously unknown surface sources of CCl4 and potential vadose zone sources that may be continuing to contaminate groundwater.  Investigation of the known source term waste sites in FY03 will involve drilling two wells directly in the waste pits and trenches taking limited samples at different depth horizons. Results of this drilling program will be available towards the end of FY03 or early FY04. The dispersed CCl4 vadose zone plume will be investigated in two steps.  Step I, which began in FY02, uses direct push technology to sample the shallow depths below and around the plant piping and other subsurface infrastructure which could have leaked significant amounts of the solvent, and step II will investigate the intermediate to deep vadose zone to the top of the water table.  Results of the step I investigation will be available in mid-FY03 and the results of the step II investigation will be available mid-FY04. The current baseline for the site includes obtaining a final record of decision for the carbon tetrachloride plume by 2024 to meet final remediation goals for the Hanford 200-Area.  The Hanford Site goals included in the PMP call for implementation of a final remedy for both groundwater and the vadose zone by 2012.  The goal of this project is the confirmation of a conceptual model(s) in FY04, that will describe the nature, extent and mass of the DNAPL. Achievement of this goal will provide the necessary information to reduce the risk in meeting RL?s specific commitment to:  (1) complete a carbon tetrachloride DNAPL field investigation by 2004 stated in Strategic Initiative 6 in the Hanford PMP and (2) the regulatory agencies prior to the CERCLA 5-Year Review scheduled in 2005 to support implementing changes to the current remedial action decision. A pre-proposal conference will be held in Richland, Washington on February 11, 2003 to present site specific information.  In order to prepare for the pre-proposal conference/site tour, prior to close of business (4:00 p.m. PST) on February 4, 2003, you are asked to provide the company name, address, telephone, facsimile, and E-mail address, as well as the number (limit of 2 individuals per company), names, and dates of birth of persons (only US citizens),  planning to attend the pre-proposal conference/site tour by sending an E-mail notice to Scott_W_Petersen@rl.gov.

<DESC>(THIS IS PART 1 OF 2  OF GAO's PART 12 SYNOPSIS/SOLCITATION NO. OAM-2003-N-0002, SECTIONS I THROUGH VI) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for an IDIQ contract based on firm fixed prices per-transaction for Travel Management (TM) services for GAO at its headquarters in the Washington DC metropolitan area and 11 field offices located throughout the continental United States.  Included as part of the services to be provided are the travel services requirements for the Library of Congress (LOC).  Services to be provided will include comprehensive travel services, management reporting services and basic meeting arrangements.  In addition to the TM Services, GAO is seeking an optional Desktop Reservations Booking System.  GAO's Travel Management Center's (TMC) desktop reservation booking system must have a self-service web-based online travel-booking engine with the flexibility to be interfaced with Gelco's Travel Manager  (presently) 8.1 or higher and/or a system developed by the Government under the eTravel initiative.  The booking system must be able to plan and make reservations for Government travelers using the Government city-pair contract fares, the Government rental car program, and the Government lodging programs.  The desktop reservation booking system is being procured presently as an optional requirement.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a Request for Proposals (RFP) OAM-2003-N-0002.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized in fifteen (15) parts: I. General Requirements II. Background; III. Scope; IV. Facilities; V. Management Information VI. Titles of Addendum Statement of Work Requirements; VII. Format of Proposal; VIII. Price Proposal Instructions; IX. Evaluation Criteria; X. Applicability of FAR; XI.  Addendum Custom GAO Clauses;  XII. Procurement Schedule;  XIII. Submission of Offeror's Technical Questions; XIV. Point of Contact;  XV. Submission of Offers and XVI. Building Entry for Handcarried Proposals. I. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain commercial travel management services for the United States General Accounting Office.  Under this contract, comprehensive domestic and international travel services, management reporting, and basic meeting arrangements will be provided. II.   BACKGROUND:  The General Accounting Office (GAO) is the investigative arm of the United States Congress, and is responsible for examining all matters related to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds.  Congress, government agencies and the public rely on GAO for timely, independent, nonpartisan analysis.  Principal GAO activities include: the conduct of audits and evaluations of government programs and activities; development of government wide accounting, auditing and evaluation principles and standards; provision of comprehensive legal services to the Congress and government agencies; and issuance of written reports and testimony to the Congress. GAO carries out its mission through headquarter units located in the Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area, and 11 field offices located throughout the continental United States.  The bulk of all travel performed is for mission-related purposes, primarily the conduct of audits and evaluations, and often may be subject to short notice requests, as well as last minute and en route changes.  Headquarters units account for approximately 40-50 percent of GAO travel expenditures, with the balance originating in field offices.  Estimated GAO travel expenditures for the government fiscal year ending September 30, 2003 are:  common carrier transportation - $4 million; lodging - $1.5 million; and car rental - $300,000.  The LOC travel expenditures for the government fiscal year ending September 30, 2003 is: common carrier transportation - $750,000.00.  The distribution of domestic and international travel expenses, respectively, is 80 and 20 percent.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE VOLUMES ARE ESTIMATES ONLY; ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE; AND DO NOT REPRESENT A GUARANTEE OF SALES.  Like many public and private organizations, GAO faces the prospect of an increased and more technologically complex workload without concurrent increases in staff or other resources.  Consequently, it has turned its attention to seeking quality and productivity gains to meet the ever-growing demands and challenges of the future while maintaining its reputation for professional excellence.  GAO anticipates that firms providing commercial goods and services to the agency will share its commitment to quality management principles and practices as a means of ensuring consistently reliable and responsive delivery of quality services to their clients. III.  SCOPE:  A. CORE SERVICES The contractor is solely responsible for assuring that services are provided in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract. The contractor must have methods to make reservations at its servicing office(s) when its Computer Reservation System (CRS) system is not operating and/or when reservations must be made on an airline that does not subscribe to CRS.  The contractor will provide or arrange for the following official travel services:  RESERVATIONS AND TICKETING SERVICES - The contractor will provide GAO travelers with comprehensive reservation and ticketing services consistent with those normally provided to commercial accounts.   The contractor is expected to make available to GAO any specialized reservation assistance normally provided to the contractor's preferred commercial accounts, such as international travel desks, executive help desks, dedicated hotel, car, and other supplier desks, and group/meeting arrangements.  Air passenger tickets must be issued only from approved Airline Reporting Corporation (ARC) or its approved equivalent such as airline approved ticket stock. - The reservation system must be a WEB based application hosted on the vendor's data center.  The reservation system must be compatible with Internet Explorer 5.1 or higher and the vendor's data center must support a virtual private network (VPN) connection to GAO's network.  The reservation system must provide real-time updates to Gelco's Travel Manager version 8.1 or higher. - As reservations are made within the reservation system, estimated costs are updated on the Travel Manager travel order.   Once a travel order is approved within Travel Manager, the travel is funded and the reservation system must process the tickets.  When a travel order is cancelled within Travel Manager, the reservation system must also cancel all tickets and related reservations.  GAO is hosting Travel Manager on a Windows 2000 server using an ORACLE 8.1.6 database on a separate WINDOWS NT 4 server.  - The contractor must be able to participate in the Federal Government eTravel Initiative that establishes a single portal that Federal employees making official business trips use to obtain travel authorizations, make reservations, and pay for airline tickets and other expenses.  The eTravel Initiative?s system will work much like commercial web-based systems that the public uses to book business travel.  Ticketing Services:   Make reservations and be capable of booking reservations through the Government's eTravel Initiative and/or Gelco?s Travel Manager 8.1 or higher;  Issue and deliver tickets for all commercial modes of transportation to include air, rail, bus, or steamship; 	 Provide last seat availability, boarding passes, and advance seat assignment on all airlines for which the contractor can provide these services;  Provide the traveler with information/reservations for ground transportation service;  Make itinerary changes;  Issue refunds;  Claim travelers' awards for frequent flyer airline benefits;  Furnish other services related to making and booking a reservation.; and  Consider use of prepaid tickets only as a last resort.  Agency Travel Policy Compliance:  Comply with GSA's Airline City-Pair Program;  Participate in the Federal Government eTravel Initiative which establishes a single portal that Federal employees making official business trips use to obtain travel authorizations, make reservations, and pay for airline tickets and other expenses.  The system will work much like commercial web-based systems that the public uses to book business travel.  Comply with the provisions of the Fly America Act;  GAO's Actual Subsistence policy limits maximum reimbursement to 150% of the established lodging and Meals & Incidentals Expenses rate;  Premium class travel must be authorized on the official travel authorization prior to issuance of ticket.  All requests for use of premium class fares should be reported to the COTR prior to issuance of ticket.   Lowest available fare except for the constraints of the contract city-pair airline program and the Fly America Act, require prepayment audit by the contractor to confirm the lowest available rate at the time of ticketing.   Use of fares involving penalties for changes or cancellations should be considered only on a case-by-case basis where travelers can meet all applicable restrictions, and there is little likelihood that plans will change.  When such fares are used for official segments of travel, they should be authorized on the travel authorization in order to protect the traveler from individual liability for paying any penalty resulting from a change/cancellation beyond his or her control.  When such fares are used for personal segments of travel taken in conjunction with official trips, travelers are responsible for paying any penalties resulting from a change or cancellation and should be so advised by the contractor at the time reservations are made.  When no contract or other discount fares are available, full coach fares may be used.  Book domestic rental cars using the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) Department of Defense?s negotiated rental car agreements.  Federal travelers will not be reimbursed insurance coverage for non-MTMC car rentals for domestic rentals.  Lodging Reservations:  Comprehensive lodging services to include:   Making and confirming hotel and motel reservations and rates, to the extent possible, within the per diem rates set for government travelers.  Travelers must be advised if their lodging rate exceeds the authorized per diem rate for a locality.  Contractor is reminded that the final selection of lodging accommodations rests with the traveler;   Book reservations in compliance with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 and the Government's eTravel Initiative;  Knowledge and ability to book travelers in hotels participating in the GSA Federal Premier Lodging Program;  Knowledge of tax exemptions offered to federal travelers, and to the extent practical, to have available applicable state and local tax exemption forms.  Commercial Rental Vehicle Reservations 	? Use of the Department of Defense Military Traffic Management Command  (MTMC) negotiated discount automobile rental agreements;  Provide lowest available rates if there are no government rates, including corporate or preferred rates, available to or negotiated by the contractor;  Advise overseas travelers of the need to obtain insurance for overseas car rentals;  Secure automobile insurance for overseas travelers; and  Book reservations through the Government's eTravel Initiative.  Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities  Arrange necessary and reasonable special accommodations, including, but not limited to, airline seating, in-terminal transfers, ground transportation, and barrier-free or otherwise accessible lodging.  International Travel ? Arrange for international travel, including reservations and ticket delivery for air, rail, bus, or steamship transportation, reservations for hotel/motel accommodations, and for car rental services;  Advise travelers on:  Documentation requirements, including passports and visas;  Necessary health and safety requirements, including inoculations and vaccinations either required or suggested;  Locations of American embassies and consulates;  Foreign currency exchange rates and transactions, securing automobile insurance in conjunction with foreign car rentals, excess baggage requirements and fees;  Conditions at foreign destinations, including climatic conditions, appropriate and essential types of clothing, national and religious holidays, civil unrest, etc.; and  Upon request, the contractor must assist travelers in obtaining passports and visas.

Ticket Delivery   Ensure timely delivery of tickets, itineraries, and other travel documents to Federal travelers. Unless otherwise requested, tickets and other documents will be issued no earlier than necessary to arrive two (2) days before departure. ? Primary method of ticket delivery will be ticketless or electronic ticketing where available and when acceptable to traveler.  When electronic ticketing is not available, U.S. first class mail or overnight delivery, as appropriate, will be used to ensure timely ticket delivery.   Fees for ticket issuance/delivery apply when (1) ticketless or electronic ticketing is available but not acceptable to the traveler, or (2) when electronic ticket delivery is not available and the traveler requires a delivery option beyond that required to ensure timely ticket delivery.  The Contractor will be able to provide ticket delivery for emergency tickets at an appropriate domestic airport within two (2) hours notice by the traveler. NOTE: The offeror is invited to propose how they would provide ticket delivery services to GAO. Reconciliation of Centrally Billed Accounts:  The contractor shall have the ability to provide at no cost automated reconciliation of transportation billings charged through GAO?s centrally billed accounts with GAO's charge card vendor.  The contractor must use an automated accounting system with a direct interface among the reservation, ticketing, and accounting elements so that all passenger reports and summary data are automatically generated from point-of-sale information.  The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of a transaction file from the charge card vendor within one (1) working day.  No later than five (5) working days from receipt of  transaction file, the Contractor shall match the charge card vendor's transaction file data against its own transactions and provide GAO with reconciled charges, or notify the charge card vendor and GAO if, and why, the file cannot be used for reconciliation.

GAO will provide telephone service, reasonable office space, furnishings and equipment as required for one agent in the GAO headquarters building if the TMC's full reservation staff is located off-site.    Hours of Operation:   Monday through Friday between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Eastern time.

<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for award of a Subcontract to provide the services described below to pre-qualified bidders only.  
To be deemed pre-qualified to receive an RFP, potential bidders must submit a completed Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Standard Form No. 254, "Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire," addressing specific areas of expertise and experience. In addition, potential bidders must respond to the pre-qualification questions listed below.   

SCOPE DEFINITION:
Background:  BSC has been released to begin preliminary design of the YMP in support of the aggressive project schedule to submit a License Application (LA) in 2004 and support the start of operations to receive and possess waste in 2010.  A key element needed early in preliminary design is the input of key functional and operational requirements from an owner/operator perspective.  This includes such inputs as:
- Operating and maintenance philosophy; 
- Redundancy, availability  and reliability requirements; 
- Operator staffing and training requirements; 
- Off-normal event recovery requirements; 
- Support facility and staffing requirements; 
- Operating margins, etc.;  
- Building and hot cell design;
- Fuel handling;
- Replication potential for designs created and proven elsewhere;
- Replication potential for key equipment;
All these inputs are required early in the preliminary design because they significantly impact building size, site arrangement, support facility needs, and related decisions that must be made before the safety analyses (hazards and pre-closure safety analysis) can be performed and the designed progressed to the point it will support a docketable LA.
Following the initial inputs, the preliminary design must be developed using proven technologies and designs, for the most part, directly replicated or adapted from existing proven designs.  
 The Subcontractor will have four primary areas of responsibility:
1. An early review and input to functional and operational requirements (F&OR) prepared by others and identification of specific portions of the material handling and hot cell processes that can replicate or adapt proven designs.
2. Material handling and hot cell design inputs, based largely on replicated designs, to BSC's LA 2003 design effort with continuing support through LA submittal in 12/2004.  This would include inputs to safety analyses, equipment specifications, failure mode and effect analyses (FMEA), and related activities.
3. Input to equipment purchase specifications and overview of BSC's detailed design in 2005.  This would include support of the NRC licensing process.
4. Operations inputs including operator qualification and training requirements, startup procedures, and initial operating procedures.
In addition, based on Subcontractor's capabilities, BSC may elect to include aspects of facility and support system design in Subcontractor's scope.
Description of Work: The scope of work for this Subcontract(s) will include furnishing all supervision, labor, and material for performing Designs, Design Inputs, and Design Reviews of the nuclear handling facilities of the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) Project. The work would be performed in phases. During the first phase, Subcontractor would review Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) requirements, design constraints, conceptual design, and related documents and provide:
- Comments on the overall facilities breakdown and functional descriptive;
- Comments on the overall site arrangement and operating philosophy;
- A site level process flow diagram identifying major systems, subsystems, and components recommended;
- Identification of proven designs that could potentially be replicated at YMP;
- Identification of proven designs that could be adapted to YMP;
- Identification of processes and equipment unique to YMP;
- Preliminary throughput study with time diagrams, defining the number of process lines required; 
- Preliminary sizing and requirements for operations and support areas (health physics, change rooms, maintenance areas, control room, etc.);
- Preliminary requirements for HVAC, radwaste, decon, and other support systems including buildings being designed by BSC;
- Control philosophy;
- Hot cell and building functional and operational requirements to be used by BSC to design the facilities;  
- Support to BSC's 3D CADD design development effort.
The second phase would continue through LA submittal (12/04).  During this period, Subcontractor would continue with process system development as well as overall site development.  In addition, Subcontractor would assist BSC with the LA design and licensing effort.  At the end of 12/2003, a fully integrated Subcontractor-BSC design suitable for LA docketing must be complete.  
Phases 3 and 4 would include activities to support detailed design, procurement, equipment prototyping and mockups, development of operating procedures, operator training preparation, development of maintenance procedures, and related activities.  It is envisioned that Subcontractor would continue with all activities related to the detailed design of material handling equipment and BSC would continue with the design of buildings, support systems and facility related activities and procurement of the equipment with Subcontractor's support.

<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), Land Remediation and Pollution Control Division (LRPCD) has a requirement for the development of a review document that shall assist EPA in selecting an appropriate watershed model or an integrated watershed modeling system (i.e., externally linked modules) for Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) development and evaluation of alternative Best Management Practices (BMPs) to achieve desired load reductions in targeted watersheds.  Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires all states to develop and implement TMDL for their impaired water bodies and water bodies threatened to become impaired. While considerable improvements have been achieved in reducing the amount of point source pollution from factories and municipalities being discharged into U.S. waters, over 40 percent of the Nation's water bodies remain impaired, in that they do not meet water quality standards for their designated use (USEPA 1996). Much of this is attributed to agricultural drainage and other diffuse-source pollution (NPSP) whose control is difficult because the source areas can be hard to identify and typical treatment methods are infeasible due to the distributed nature of the pollutants. Hydrologic, transport and fate models simulate cause-and-effect relationship and offer an effective alternative for quantifying potential benefits of planned restorations of disturbed watersheds and evaluating the efficacy BMPs. The objectives of this contract will be to provide a review document that: (1) evaluates watershed hydrologic/hydrodynamic and water quality models that can be used by states for developing and implementing TMDL for sediments, nutrients, and toxins; and (2) identify areas in which further research and development could improve the performance and usability of currently used models.  The RFP shall be competed on a full and open basis and the EPA anticipates the award of a fixed fee type contract.  Solicitation No. PR-CI-03-10115 is expected to be issued in February 2003 and close 30 days thereafter. It will be available on the internet at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the given web site.  Hard copies will only be issued on a limited basis to those eligible firms without internet access.  Request for hard copies shall be mailed, faxed or e-mail to the POC.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to frequently check the site for any amendments.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the EPA.

If an electronic presentation is proposed (using either Microsoft PowerPoint or Corel Presentation), a printed paper copy of the sample will suffice unless the offeror wishes to provide the sample on a diskette or CDROM.  Provide three sample examination questions and answers related to each of the sample texts discussed above.  One question shall be multiple choice, one shall be True/False, and one shall be short answer or calculational.  Specify the names and locations of the facilities intended to be used for the field (hands-on) exercises.  Specify the distance between these facilities and the main classroom, and estimate the travel time to and from the facilities.  The offeror should indicate what capabilities the facilities have, such as the age and type of the facility equipment.  Any important considerations such as workload which might interfere with routine access by the class during normal duty hours should be specified.  More than one facility may be specified.  The use of multiple facilities would provide for smaller groups, thereby yielding more hands-on time and less waiting for students.  Specify where the presentations will be conducted.  Within ten working days after receipt of notice that a firm has been selected for award, the firm selected for award must provide the NRC panel members with a tour of all locations (classrooms and facilities) to be used during the training.  If determined to be inadequate by the panel, the offeror will be allowed the opportunity to provide an alternate facility.  Furnishing adequate training facilities is a condition for award and the contract will not be awarded prior to satisfaction of this condition.  Failure of the selected firm to comply with this condition within the ten working days shall void the notice of selection.  In that event, the Government shall select another firm for award, and the original firm selected for award shall have no claims for costs incurred prior to contract award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This notice is a MODIFICATION to a synopsis previously published in the Commerce Business Daily on 03/07/00 to notify the public that this procurement will be conducted under FAR Part 12.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the College of American Pathologists(CAP), a not-for-profit Illinois corporation at 325 Waukegan Road, Northfield, Illinois 60093-2750, for a five-year fixed-price type contract.  The contract will provide NLM with a license to incorporate SNOMED-CT (College of American Pathologists registered trademark) CAP's proprietary product, into the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus (National Library of Medicine registered trademarks); to use SNOMED-CT within the UMLS Metathesaurus for research purposes within the NLM, in NLM?s production data creation systems, and in its publicly accessible retrieval systems; and to redistribute SNOMED-CT within the UMLS Metathesaurus free-of-charge to U.S. entities for use within the U.S. for any health care, public health, research, educational, or statistical updates to SNOMED-CT.  SNOMED-CT is a comprehensive, multi-axial, controlled terminology suitable for use in patient, public health, and research data.  SNOMED-CT is a proprietary product of the College of American Pathologists, which has developed successive versions of the terminology over the past 40 years.  Earlier versions of SNOMED are already included in NLM?s UMLS Metathesaurus.  In several independent tests and evaluations, including the 1996/97 Large-Scale Vocabulary test sponsored by the National Library of Medicine and the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (then the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) and other studies conducted by the Computer-Based Patient Record Institute, SNOMED was identified as the most comprehensive structured and controlled clinical terminology in the English language.  These studies also showed that the United Kingdom?s National Health Service Clinical Terms (formerly known as the Read Codes) covered a similar, but slightly lower percentage of clinical concepts and, in some respects, provided coverage that was complementary to SNOMED. Subsequent to these studies, the College of American Pathologists and the U.K. National Health Service entered into an agreement and merged the two systems into SNOMED-CT, a comprehensive clinical vocabulary with an advanced and sophisticated knowledge structure, that is highly suitable for inclusion in the UMLS Metathesaurus and for use in the broad range of patient care, public health, research, educational, and statistical applications undertaken by NLM and other UMLS users.  Because SNOMED-CT is a proprietary product of the College of American Pathologists, NLM has determined that the College of American Pathologists is the only source capable of providing it.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  NAICS Code 511140.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>With regard to the following paragraph drawn from BAA 03-03, DARPA calls attention to the Video Verification of Identity (VIVID) program, now actively seeking technology solutions in the VIVID domain:
  
IXO is interested in new technologies to exploit EO and IR motion imagery on unmanned aerial vehicles in support of precision strike operations, to provide persistent sensing and to support unambiguous identification and tracking of moving ground targets. DARPA seeks innovative concepts for significantly advancing the state of the art in tracking vehicles and dismounted soldiers from airborne platforms, even in dense traffic and with frequent occlusions; for deriving detailed descriptions of targets on-the-fly, sufficient to recognize that same target when seen at a later time in a different place; for matching such descriptions to EO and IR video to confirm the identity of the target; for detecting moving personnel and vehicles, without false alarms due to parallax of raised structures, illumination, shadows, wind, etc. for searching a target area for noncombatant people and vehicles that could become unintended casualties of a precision attack; for locating targets observed by airborne video to less than 5 meters absolute geopositioning accuracy, and for classifying vehicles by type, based on observation in EO or IR motion imagery. 

For technical amplification regarding the VIVID Program, please reference http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/vivid/index.htm. For proposal submission instructions, please reference DARPA BAA 03-03 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS at URL: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa03-03(2).htm.

<DESC>This is Amendment No.1 to solicitation number CON-03-0005.  This amendment provides answers to questions received from prospective offerors.  The are labeled followed by the BBG.  The due date for receipt of proposals has NOT been extended.  No aspects of this solicitation have been changed with this amendment.

Q. (1) Can you provide specific definitions of SES categories A, B, C1 and C2
for the subject countries?
A. (1)  No, we cannot provide specific definitions of these SES categories.  It is
IBB's concern that contractors sample respondents in SES categories A through
C2, "as these categories are commonly defined by market research agencies in
the countries concerned."  In conducting the research, contractors should apply
categorization schemes drawn from previous experience or knowledge of market
research in the area.
Q. (2) What is the estimated total budget for this project?
 A. (2) The Government's estimated budget for this project is within the simplified acquisition threshold.  However, the Government cannot disclose its estimated budget for this project.   
Q. (3) What is the approximate percentage of households in the market that have
audio cassette or CD playback capability?
A. (3) The contractor is to provide playback capability.  See Statement of Work paragraph (e).
Q. (4) What is the average Time Spent Listening to music radio stations among
the 17-28 demographic in each country?
A. (4) The BBG/IBB does not provide results from previous research to prospective offerors.  It is a reasonable assumption that 17-28 year olds who listen to music one hour or more per week and music on the radio 30 minutes or more per week are not difficult to find in these countries.
Q. (5) Is there a general acceptance of contemporary Western music in each of these countries?
A. (5) The BBG/IBB does not provide results from previous research to prospective offerors.  It is a reasonable assumption that a significant number of 17-28 year-old music
listeners in these countries enjoy Western music.

A. (6) Yes.  All interviews shall be conducted face-to-face in the home. See Statement of Work paragraph (e).

A. (7) No.  There is no "approved vendor list" for sub-contractors.
Q. (8) Where will results be presented - US, abroad?
A. (8) The research is intended to support the development of music programming
for the IBB's Arabic language radio service, Radio Sawa.  While fundamentally designed for internal programming use, results may be made public.
Q. (9) What health and safety precautions will be employed on behalf of our representative(s) if travel to the subject regions is necessary?
A. (9) Prospective offerors should consult US consular information on travel to the region (see www.state.gov).
Q. (10) Should bids include necessary travel expenses?
A. (10) Price quotations should include all expenses.  See paragraph (ix) The Government will award a firm-fixed contract (purchase order).

ANSWER:  "Extreme CCTV"

Item # 2  -   There is a battery pack for the above camera: Part # BX82-4
and a charger Part # EXPS3.0. Are these the correct Part numbers you want?
There are several different batteries, so we need to know exactly which one
you need.  
Answer:  We just require compatible batteries, battery charger and AC 
power source.   
 
Item # 3  -  Do you have a desired or specified manufacturer and part number
for this item? There are many different manufacturers of these.  
No particular part number or manufacturer.  
 
Item # 4  -  Do you have a desired or specified manufacturer and part number

No particular part number or manufacturer.  
 
Item # 5  -  Do you have a desired or specified manufacturer and part number
for this item? There are many different manufacturers of these. 
 No particular part number or manufacturer.  
 
Item # 6  -  Do you have a manufacturer and part number for this item?  Or
is this a custom made item?  
No particular part number or manufacturer.  
 
Item # 7  -  What type of coax cable do you want? RG59, RG6, Plenum, non
Plenum ?   
A: WE NEED CABLE THAT IS ALL WEATHER, EASILY RUN, AND THAT WORKS WITH THE CAMERA SYSTEM OTHER THEN THAT WE DON'T CARE.  HOWEVER THE THINNER THE BETTER FOR TACTICAL REASONS. 
 
Item # 006  states "Fast deployment portable carry case-heavy duty video-coaxial cable (monitor-quad) monitor to quad, close proximity with BNC connectors, assembled when shipped."  Does this require 1 carrying case with the following items in each. 4 cameras, 4 camera battery, 1 quad, 1 5.6" monitor, 1 battery for monitor and cables.  If this is what you need we will not have a problem furnishing your needs.   
Answer:  Yes.
 
1)  Assuming 8 deployable cases are for the Monitor/Quad assembly - What is the preferred deployment container(s) for the camera's/batteries and peripheral equipment needed?
 
A: EVERYTHING MUST BE CARRIED IN PELICAN TYPE CASES. ONE KIT NO MORE THEN THREE CASES AND NO MORE THEN A 100 POUNDS PER CASE.
 
2)  Please clarify intent for Powering units outside of batteries.  Chargers and transformers will need permanent power.  Will this power be 220/50Hz or standard American 120/60Hz?  
 
A: DEPENDS ON THE LOCATION, THE UNIT SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE BOTH 220/50Hz AND 120/60Hz POWER.
 
3)  How will the camera's be mounted when deployed?  Tree/Tripod/Wall Mount/Etc.
 
A: SYSTEM WILL BE MOUNTED EITHER ON TREES, WALLS, OR POLES.
 
4)  Please provide intended Mon/Quad Deployment case layout.
 
A: PELICAN TYPE CASE WITH NO MORE THAN 3 CASES TO HOLD ALL THE EQUIPMENT.
 
5)  Please indicate groups of camera's for frequency allocation.  Currently, the EX82MECC has 4 frequencies.  It is a 2.4GHz transmitter.  It is possible to achieve up to 8 frequencies in a slightly different configuration.  Also concern here is for the close proximity of the camera's with like frequencies.  
 
A: THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM SYSTEMS WILL BE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM EACH OTHER TO OPERATE CORRECTLY 4 CAMERAS WILL BE LINKED TO ONE MONITOR.  
 
6)  Will a capability/operational demonstration be required at the place of performance?
 
A: NO, A DEMONSTRATION WILL NOT BE REQUIRED.  
 
7)  Please clarify request for 5.6" LCD monitor.  If intended operation is for 8 sets of 4 camera's connected to a quad - this size monitor will most likely not provide the intended clarity of view in the full screen and most likely worse in the quad screen.
 
A: ONE KIT WILL BE 4 CAMERAS CONNECTED TO ONE QUAD CONNECTED TO ONE MONITOR  .  MAXIMUM SIZE FOR THE MONITOR IS  8?.   
 
8)  In the solicitation it calls for 500 ft of coax, 100 BNC's and a crimp tool.  Please clarify/explain the utilization.  If hardwiring - there should also be a power cable component.  Other Miscellaneous materials for a complete system have not been identified.
 
A: TRUE, WE INTENDED TO OPERATE ON BATTERY POWER PRIMARILY, HOWEVER WE NEED TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO OPERATE OFF OF AC POWER WHEN THE TEAM IS ON THE GROUND FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.   
 
ITEM 0001, qty 32, part number EX82MECC, dual cameras and wireless
receivers, etc. -- QUESTION: According to the vendor, there is both an
EX82MECC8 version and EX82MECC9 version.  Which one should we quote?
 
A; EITHER AS LONG AS THEY MEET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS
 
ITEM 0003, qty 8, 12V color quad w/ battery charger, -- QUESTION: Is this a PORTABLE color quad processor?  Is any vendor preferred?  Is there a requirement on battery life?
 
A: YES ON COLOR, NO PREFFERED VENDOR, 12 HOUR MINIMUM ON BATTERY LIFE.
 
ITEM 0004, qty 8, 5.6" LCD monitor -- QUESTION: Is this a portable field monitor of the type made by Tote Vision, LCD-562?  Is any vendor preferred?
 
A: SIZE LIMITATION ON MONITOR IS 8?.  NO VENDOR PREFERENCE.  

ITEM 0006, qty 8, Fast deployment portable carry case -- QUESTIONS: Is this a separate item from the coaxial cable, also listed under ITEM 0006?  What will be contained in this carry case?  (Or, rather, what dimensions are needed for this case?)  Is there a preference about the type of material which composes the outside of the case -- hard plastic shell or metal or synthetic fiber? Heavy duty video coaxial cable (monitor-quad) monitor to quad, close proximity with BNC connectors, pre-assembled -- QUESTIONS: Is this a cable which connects quad to individual monitor or cameras to quad or both?  How long do they need to be?  In what kind of environment will they be used -- will they drag outside on wet earth or lie on dry pavement or indoors?
 
A: EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE COMPLETE PLECAN STYLE CASES ARE PREFFEERED AS FOR CABLES AND WIRES FOR HARD WIRING A SYSTEM IT NEEDS TO BE LONG ENOUGH TO HANDLE 100 METERS OF DISTANCE.  I REALIZE THAT A SEPARATE SPOL OF WIRE MIGHT BE NEEDED AND THAT IS FINE.  SEE ATTACHED DIAGRAM PAGE.  
 
ITEM 0007, 500 ft of coaxial cable -- QUESTIONS: Same issues as on the
cable above -- What's the environment where cable is going to run?  We need to know this to determine the part number for a cable with the appropriate jacket and insulation materials.  Indoor or outdoor?  Plenum or non-plenum?
 
A: ASSUME WORST CASE OUTSIDE, IN WEATHER, REMOTE LOCATION. 
 
1.  Please advise what a EX82MECC is.  Who is the manufacturer?  
 Extreme CCTV
2.  Are the cameras equipped with IR illuminators or is this a separate line item?
The camera should come as a single component with IR illuminators 
3.  Do you plan on using all 32 pieces in close proximity to one another?  This is particularly important when dealing with the wireless video transmitters and receivers.
See attached diagram page. 
4.  Do you have a list of specs, catalog page, or similar printed material listing the exact specs you're searing for?
 No Specifications are available.  
 
1. What items other than the LCD monitor and quad processor are to fit in the deployment case? (ie. cameras, batteries...)
 
A: EVERYTHING MUST BE IN THE CASES AND NO MORE THEN THREE CASES, WEIGHING NO MORE THAN 100 POUNDS EACH.
 
2. Is there to be any mounting apratise for the cameras and receivers? (ie. tripod)
 
A: CAMERAS MUST BE ABLE TO BE MOUNTED ON WALLS, TREES, POLES, ETC..
 
3. Is there a weight restriction for the case? Is this a one-man or two-man lift?
 
A: YES, NO MORE THEN A 100 POUNDS PER CASES AND NO MORE THEN THREE CASES.  WE REALLY WANT EACH CASE TO WEIGH LESS THEN 70 POUNDS BUT 100 POUNDS IS WITHIN OUR RANGE NO MORE THEN THAT.
 
4. Is there a requirement for the functional battery time?
 
A: WE WANT THE BAT'S TO LAST AT LEAST 12 HOURS
 
5. How long of a connection cable is required from the quad processor to the video receiver?
 
A: TEN FEET SHOULD BE LONG ENOUGH 
 
6. In CLIN 0003, is there a list for the approved 12v Quad processors?
 
A: NO
 
7. With this being wireless equipment, is there a frequency authorization issue?
 
A: NO, I realize that we might get a par 15 devices here and that is expectable, however spread net technology should be part of system  


Diagram:
6th Special Operations Squadron
Man-Portable Detection/Surveillance System

Subject: The development of a 6th Special Operations Squadron SOS man-portable DAY/NIGHT Detection/Surveillance system.  

Mission: The 6th Special Operations Squadron is a combat aviation advisory unit specifically organized, trained, and equipped to advise and train foreign aviation forces to employ and sustain their own assets in both peace and war and, when necessary, to integrate those assets into joint, multi-national operations.  A principal objective of 6 SOS advisory operations is to facilitate the availability, reliability, safety, and interoperability of host-nation (HN) or participating-nation (PN) aviation resources to support combined surface special operations forces.

Scope of Operations:  6 SOS supports the theater combatant commanders in both peace and war in a wide variety of local and regional conflicts and emergencies.  The squadron?s combat advisory capabilities are applied throughout the range of military operations--from military operations other than war to major regional conflict.  Squadron capabilities are focused on three interrelated mission areas:  foreign internal defense (FID), coalition support, and unconventional warfare (UW).  The mission arena also encompasses such collateral activities as advising on air support for disaster assistance and humanitarian aid.

Requirement: Due to the unique mission of the 6th SOS and the operating locations we must conduct our own force protection operations.  To aid us we want to build a man-portable detection/surveillance kit.  Because of our operating procedures and the way we conduct specific events we need to be able to deploy this system in a very small package and it must be able to be carried as checked baggage on commercial airliners.  

Standard Operating Set-Up:  This system will be employed to help protect a single structure; size of the structure is unknown because it changes from location.  The diagram below out lines the intended set-up for six cameras.






 







The goal is to be able to get a visual on targets coming at you both day and night.  We are not concerned with close in detection. This system will cover detection 15 meters and out on avenues of approach.  Close in sentries will handle the rest.  However this system should be able to be used for point surveillance operations also if needed.  

Specifications: The following specifications must be meet. 

1.	The system must be man-portable and contained in it?s own carrying cases.  The entire system should not take up more then three cases.  

2.	Each carrying case must weigh less then a 100 pounds loaded with equipment. Everything to operate the system must be in theses cases no exception. Cases must be able to be carried as checked baggage on any commercial airliner. 

3.	This system should be easily installed/recoverable from any surface i.e walls, trees, poles, etc.).  The system should be all weather capable to handle dessert and jungle environments to include cold/wet weather.  

4.	The system must be IR capable and the system needs to really work.   

5.	The cameras themselves must be wireless with the ability to be powered by AC power. They must be battery powered capable and this will be it?s primary mode of operation. System should be able to run on either 120 AC or 220 AC. 

6.	One kit will consist of the following components. 
?	6 x Wireless Camera
?	1 x LCD monitor 
?	12 x Batteries
?	1 x Battery Charger 
?	1 x AC Power Converter
?	1 x Quad Spreader   
?	Cable, cord, wire, etc.. To hook everything up via AC power (If need)
?	Carrying Cases (no more then three cases per kit)

<DESC>Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoD's new 'system of systems' environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter-or a similar forcing function construct-to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of 'key performance parameters' throughout the acquisition process. NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. The products will include analysis of education and training technology and processes, incorporation of human performance factors across the processes, insertion of technology, and streamlining of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process. The effort will include the development of training system acquisition and development guidance products that include DoD training Military Standards, Specifications, and Handbooks, electronic performance support systems, and other aids for training managers and developers. This effort will also include market research of best ISD business practices related to the ISD/SAT, interactive multimedia instruction, advanced distributed learning, distributed mission training, and trainer acquisition processes. It will include independent verification and validation of computer-based training and education courses and products, analysis of industry training processes and potential application for DoD training and education. It will also include guidance for identification of required human performance measures and opportunities for embedded training early in the acquisition process. The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. The Contractor must have been actively involved in that deliberative process to ensure a seamless transition to emerging acquisition and development initiatives. The Contractor must additionally have experience in the authoring and revision of the current guiding documents. Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with MIL-PRF-29612, MIL-HDBK-29612, related DIDs, MIL-PRF-XXXX and MIL-HDBK-XXXX for trainers and job-aids for enhancing their usefulness. In addition to the above the contractor must have knowledge of and experience in documenting process and products related to the following: 1) Researching emerging training technology 2) Applying innovative processes for evaluating these technologies for applicability for implementation across the Joint Services 3) Synthesizing these processes into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements is essential. 4) Datamining 5) Section 505 Compliance 6) Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness 7) Weapons Systems and Training Systems Acquisition 8) Systems Engineering 9) Human Systems Integration 10) Human Systems Engineering 11) IMI/ADL SCORM production process 12) Human Performance Analysis 13) Training Requirements Front End Analysis 14) Cost-benefit Analysis Personnel qualifications - the Government requires the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced personnel in specific disciplines to meet the professional and technical requirements listed above.

<DESC>NOTE: This notice was previously issued 17 Dec 01, and is modified as follows: (1) Language restricting contractors that have been awarded a previous 8(a) MACC is removed. As a result, all eligible 8(a) contractors may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation. (2) The requirement to submit a Letter of Intent in response to this synopsis is removed. 

NOTICE: This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside Competitive procurement and is open to 8(a) firms only. This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposer(s) whose proposal(s), conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered. AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THE ONE SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS. THEREFORE, THE OFFEROR'S INITIAL PROPOSAL SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFEROR'S BEST TERMS FROM A COST OR PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT. This is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor(s). Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, design-build for new construction, renovation/revitalization/alteration and repair and associated work at various locations within Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico. However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in California. Types of work/projects may include, but not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, whole house revitalization, child care centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional building construction, manufacturing and industrial building construction, and other similar facilities. In support of design-build strategies, each offeror shall employ the services of an architect/engineering design firm experienced in the coordination of multi-discipline architectural/engineering design efforts in all aspects of new and renovation of various types of facilities. The Government shall not coordinate the work for the Contractor. Offerors may offer multiple lead design firms to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. The Offeror and the Lead Design Firm(s) proposed for the basic contract will be evaluated as a team. Lead Design Firm(s) (A/Es), their subsidiaries and affiliates that were involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project may not be proposed or used on a task order for that project. Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order, and may be competed on the basis of price, best value, or technically acceptable low price. Task orders may be performance oriented requiring minimal design, may occasionally be complex construction requiring design development for design-build construction or a combination of both. Task orders may not have traditional plans and specifications, but may include sketches, and request for catalog cuts, and other submittals. In order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work, the salient requirements of the task order, will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team. The awarded task order will be a performance scoped, firm fixed price task order with a specific completion date. Should any of the IDIQ Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded a task order. If a contractor selects not to attend a site visit and submit a proposal, the contractor shall provide written notification to the Contracting Officer within two days, of receipt of either a written or oral scope of work. The work to be acquired under this solicitation falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 236 (formerly NAICS 233). The annual size standard is $28.5 million. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, is $30,000,000 for each contract awarded under this solicitation. The one time minimum guarantee is $25,000. The task order range is estimated at $500,000 - $3,000,000. Individual task orders/projects may also require incorporation of sustainable design features. The basic contract is for twelve months (or earlier as determined by the Contracting Officer after the contract maximum amount of $30,000,000 per contractor is ordered by the Government). The contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total duration of 60 months or a value of $30 million per contractor, whichever occurs first. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following criteria as defined in the RFP: (1) Past performance of the Offeror's Team; (2) Experience of Offeror's Team; (3) Technical Approach; and (4) Price will be based on all labor, materials and equipment necessary to add ventilation for a total of 36 separate welding booths to an existing building and incidental related work. This work involves the replacement of two existing supply air handling units located on the roof with two new larger supply air handling units and two new exhaust fans. The proposed task order also includes fluorescent light fixtures, conduit and wiring. This project is separated into two identical Parts, Part A, and Part B, located within the same building. Each part contains 18 separate welding booths and an existing supply air-handling unit. The Government reserves the right not to award proposed Task Order 0001. Proposed Task Order 0001 may or may not be awarded through this contract or any other contract. Also, the Government reserves the right to award only one contract covering, proposed Task Order 0001. The Government further reserves the right, with sole discretion, subject to the availability of funds, to award proposed Task Order 0001 within 120 calendar days after Contract Award to the offeror submitting the best value proposal in response to the solicitation.

No site visit will be held. Firms shall be licensed/bonded and capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Code 236. The SBA Business Opportunity Specialist assigned to the 8(a) participant will determine the eligibility of the offeror. Eligibility will be determined after receipt of proposals but prior to award, and will be based on 8(a) Business Development (BD) program criteria, including whether the Participant is a small business under the NAICS/SIC code assigned to the requirement. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED. The solicitation package will be posted to the web site at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil on or about 16 January 2003.

The fuze is to be a replacement for the M223 fuze presently used and must fit in the same physical envelope when attached to the M77 grenade.  The submunition fuze should have at least two (2) separate safety features that operate in a non-spinning ballistic environment, and are suitable for deployment in the US Navy maritime environment. The fuze must not arm if submunitions are accidentally disbursed on ship.  The fuze must also have either a 99% minimum reliability rate or a self-destruct feature.  100 non-loaded metal parts sets and related assembly drawings will be requested from interested sources that have a fuze fulfilling the above-stated requirements.  The non-loaded metal parts will be requested at no cost to the Government.  The product samples will be loaded by the US Navy and assessed to ensure that the design meets US Navy minimum requirements.  Proprietary data must be marked as such on a page-by-page basis and will be kept confidential and protected where so designated.  Evaluation of the product samples will take approximately six (6) months and will be performed in Federal Government Fiscal Year 2004 (FY 04).  Product samples will be destroyed during the evaluation.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to its five (5) year Contract N01-AI-15447 with The Institute for Genomic Research for the Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center (PFGRC).  The contract currently provides scientists with centralized resources necessary to conduct functional genomics studies on a variety of pathogens and vectors for which genomic sequence information is currently, or will soon be, available.  The goals of the PFGRC are to provide microarrays, genotyping, clone access, bioinformatics, and repository support surrounded by a Center-Client web-based interface allowing easy access to resource acquisition, data and data analysis.  The PFGRC is also developing and testing emerging genomic technologies and bioinformatics tools.  The planned negotiated modification, which will provide for a level of increased effort over a period of three (3) years, (within the contract's current period) will provide for expanding current tasks such as producing and distributing microarrays, producing organism-specific DNA for the array (sequencing DNA and developing primers and PCR reactions), developing and evaluating emerging microarray technology and microbial genotyping methods, and increasing the database capacity and development of software tools for data analysis and display.  The expansion will include increasing the number of arrays that will be available to the research community, including the number of arrays available for new organisms, especially organisms considered agents of bioterrorism and have the potential to cause emerging and re-emerging diseases.  See Government Wide Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to its seven (7) year Contract N01-AI-95357 with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for Influenza Pandemic Preparedness in Asia.  The contract currently serves to elucidate the natural history of the emergence of animal influenza viruses, train scientists in the U.S. and Hong Kong in animal influenza surveillance, and prepare a series of research reagents to detect these viruses that are available to the world's influenza research community.  Additional contract responsibilities include providing characterized viruses that are suitable for use in human vaccine development and the development or procurement of diagnostic methods for the rapid identification of influenza viruses.  The planned negotiated modification, which will provide for a level of increased effort over a period of four (4) years (within the contract's current period), will expand the contract to increase surveillance efforts in Hong Kong to characterize highly pathogenic influenza viruses and identify non-pathogenic surrogate viruses that can be used for the production of vaccine lots.  The production of pilot lots of vaccine will also be undertaken and in order to test these vaccine candidates, additional reagents must be produced.  The expansion will also include developing a complete complement of reagents (antibodies, recombinant proteins, DNA primers, etc.) for all 15 known serotypes of animal influenza viruses.  These reagents will be deposited in a DMID, NIAID repository and made available to both basic researchers and other government agencies, including the FDA, to standardize vaccine candidates.  See Government Wide Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.
