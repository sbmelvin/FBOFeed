<DESC>JOINT SERVICES TRANSPORTABLE DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM SMALL SCALE (JSTDS-SS) This synopsis identifies the Governments intent to procure commercial off the shelf  (COTS) technology in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15.  An indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract  will be issued to support the Acquisition and Test Strategies.  This procurement is in support of the Joint Services Family of Decontamination Systems (JSFDS) under the Joint Program Manager for Decontamination (JPM-DC).  The JSTDS-SS goal is to acquire a small-scale decontamination system to include applicators and decontaminants, with full logistical support.  The applicator will replace the M17 Lightweight Decontamination System and expand its capability to apply decontaminants for thorough decontamination.  The goal for decontamination is to provide an effecti ve decontamination capability that is more environmentally friendly and reduces the logistics footprint. The objective of the JSTDS-SS program is to provide an increase in the warfighters decontamination capability through the fielding of JSTDS-SS over base year and four option years.  A Statement of Objectives (SOO) approach is chosen to identify the services and supplies.  The draft solicitation request for proposals (RFP) M67004-04-R-0061 describes the objectives that must be achieved, instructions for offerors, evaluation commercial items. Contractors will develop a performance work statement for production of a transportable decontamination system, including training support and materials, and implementation of performance based logistics optimizing availability at the lowest possible life-cycle cost.  Note: a resulting separate procurement action will be implemented to su pport testing under Increment II (to those offerors in the competitive range for test samples)  offeror must address ability to meet quantities identified in Draft RFP clause 52.212-2 (Phase II -Test Samples, Interim Contractor Support during testing).  The Government invites contractors to present during Industry Day 8June2004 being held at Brooks Base City, TX (San Antonio TX) suggestions/comments/questions regarding draft RFP and possible incentives for this procurement  before final RFP is posted (see next paragraph). The draft solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20, effective February 23, 2004.  The North American Industrial Classification Standard/Standard Industrial Classification (NAICS/SIC) codes for this requirement are 9999/541614 . Offerors must be registered in the CCR (Centr al Contractor Registration) database. Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information may be obtained by calling (888) 227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. As a condition of contract award, the Contractor agrees to implement the Department t of Defense web-based software application, called Wide Area Workflow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA). This application allows DOD vendors to submit and track invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically. This application allows for complete visibility throughout the acceptance and payment process. The web-site for registration is http://rmb.odgen.disa.mil/. WAWF training can be accessed at http://www.wawftraining.com.  Anticipate formal RFP to be available on or before 30June04 and Proposals with appropriate Volume quantities/cd to be due by 4:00 P.M. on Aug 6, 2004 facsimil e will not be accepted.
