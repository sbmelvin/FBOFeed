<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source procurement to the National Center for Healthy Housing, 10227 Wincopin Circle, Columbia, MD  21044.  Health and Human Services has established a national goal eliminate elevated blood lead levels of 10 micrograms or higher in children by 2010.  Currently, almost 500,000 children in the U.S. in this age range exceed the CDC recommended levels of 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood in children aged 1 – 5 years.  Because lead poisoning often occurs with no obvious symptoms, it frequently goes unrecognized. It can cause learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and at very high levels, seizures, coma, and even death.  The Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch (LPPB) in the Division of Emergency and Environmental Health Services of the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) was established by the Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988. It authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to initiate program efforts to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. This is accomplished by educating the public and health care providers, providing funds to state and local health departments to screen and provide medical care, and support research to determine the effectiveness of prevention efforts. The goal of the CDC is to eliminate childhood lead poisoning as a major public health problem. In addition, in 1997 President Clinton created the Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children that formed a Lead Poisoning Prevention Workgroup to develop recommendations to eliminate childhood lead poisoning as a public health problem in the U.S. by 2010.
The contractor, as an independent party and not as an agent of the Government, shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, supplies, travel, transportation, and supervision to perform all the services needed to achieve the objectives of this project. Specifically:  To develop white papers, conduct trainings, and facilitate technical expert panels or similar meetings/workshops for the LPPB in the areas of pediatric lead requiring a thorough knowledge of pediatric lead and established relationships with other key organizations that are well established as policy leaders in the national strategy for the Healthy People 2010 goal of elimination by the year 2010. The precise content of the programs will be determined in collaboration with the CDC, LPPB staff.   Anticipated award date is September 1, 2003. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries may be sent to Dorothy Reed Penix  by e-mail at dreedpenix@cdc.gov.
