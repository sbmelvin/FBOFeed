Databases (QPDs), Military Handbooks, and other standardized documents from the DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP) at Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) in Philadelphia, PA.

services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one
source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals,
quotations or capability statements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA))after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based
upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer
their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration changes. -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

<DESC><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) anticipates negotiation of a competitive level-of-effort contract for technical services for research and development (R&amp;D) in the physical, engineering, and life sciences. NRL seeks technical services for in-house R&amp;D and the transition of that work to the field. The high-level objectives are to design, synthesize, process, test, and characterize materials and to design, fabricate, and test sensors and systems in the laboratory and field.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'"><br /></span>
<p>The first objective involves the design, synthesis, and characterization of materials including pyrotechnic materials, fuels, propellants, explosives, metals, organics, polymers, biomaterials, inorganics, ceramics, ionic liquids, superconductors, semiconductors, nanoparticles, nanomaterials, and other functional materials for a variety of Department of Defense applications. The work spans the fields of surface science and electrochemistry, catalysis, fuel analytics, materials science, surface modification, sensor technology, micro- and nanofabrication, and nanoscience and technology. The studies require developing, operating, and maintaining laboratory instruments and preparing and modeling materials and their properties. Work also includes research and engineering support to assist in the transition of materials to control antifouling, adhesion, friction, wear, and corrosion.</p>
<p>The second objective involves the design, fabrication, and testing of physical, chemical and biological sensors and systems (hardware and software) to detect, identify, and quantify drugs of abuse, explosives, pollutants, and other environmental contaminants, pathogenic organisms, chemical/biological warfare agents, and other analytes. Computational and computer support of the R&amp;D efforts from data analysis to information technology is also required. Laboratory research and field engineering services for development and evaluation of new sensors, analytical algorithms, and navigation technologies will be required, as will their integration into new platform concepts including autonomous systems. Integration requires field shakedown studies and extended field demonstration that will be logistically supported.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for the acquisition up to three years of technical services. The performance work statement will be available as part of the solicitation. Any resultant contract will be cost plus fixed fee. This is a 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The NRL uses electronic commerce to issue requests for proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.</p>
<p>All <span>responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website <span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Garamond', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><a href="http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/Home.htm">http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/Home.htm</a></span>. </span>The government does not intend to use FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
