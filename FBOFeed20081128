<DESC>Request for Information
The purpose of this RFI is to identify areas in the SRD that you potentially canft meet because of the constraints of the MILCON facility. We need a quick and quantitative response to possibly affect building design.The Research Altitude Chambers Program Office needs to understand the extent of the consequences of procuring a system that meets all requirements of the System Requirements Document (SRD) while abiding by the constraints of the AF Research Altitude Chambers RFP MILCON Coordination Requirements document referenced therein.  Request Industry provide such information on those major items that are adversely affected by the MILCON facility constraints to include installation and assembly, test, man-rating and other certifications, operations under the most stressing scenarios, maintenance, etc.  Information should state the effect on system cost (please provide a Rough Order of Magnitude estimate only), schedule, and performance, (where possible in quantifiable terms) for systems required to meet those building constraints.  Based on these estimated impacts, what facility changes would mitigate the adverse effects?While we understand that your specific designs are not complete at this time, and that the results of this interchange of information is not contractually binding on any party, the government seeks specific recommendations.  Statements such as gmake the door biggerh, genlarge available floor spaceh, gincrease floor capacityh, etc. are insufficient.  The Government is looking for statements such as gIn order to reduce risk of installation problems and testing of the completed system, an estimate is that the minimum exterior door size of yy by zz feet is required.h  The Government makes no promise to have any changes made to the facility while noting that, if such action is to be taken, there is a limited window of opportunity to do so economically.For facility planning purposes, the program office needs an estimate the types and number of vacuum pumps required for the system to achieve performance and availability requirements under the most stressing operational scenarios?  This would include size and weight of the pumps and the footprint and installation considerations of those pumps when placed in the facility.  Are there fire/explosion hazards with the oily pump room atmosphere?  What means are typically used to mitigate these risks?Time is of the essence to justify changes in building plans!  Request industry answers by COB Monday, 1 Dec 08.  If this date is not possible, please respond as soon as you can.NOTE:1.	The following clarification on the restrictions of Chambers induced vibrations to the facility are provided:		gAffected floor area will not exceed 8000 micro]inches/second over the affected floor area.  Adhere to AISC Design Guide 11]latest edition.  No humanly perceptible vibration transmittance during chambers operation.h
2.	The following clarification on the size of the largest chamber (Chamber 2) is provided:
		gIn addition to the requirements of the SRD, Chamber 2 will need two net usable areas:  An area of the chamber no smaller than 12 ft by 17 ft shall have a minimum ceiling height of 12 ft.  AND, The remainder of the chamber will have a minimum ceiling height of 8 ft and an area of no less than 25 ft by 12 ft.
The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued electronically and will be posted on the Wright-Patterson AFB Pre-Award Information Exchange System (PIXS) web site at: https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:debra.c.bruner@usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville</a>
<DESC>This project consists of the design and construction of a Medical and Dental Clinic at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky. The overarching objective is to design and construct facilities for the military that are consistent with the design and construction practices used for civilian sector projects that perform similar functions to the military projects.  The military facility types to be constructed as part of this project include Medical Facility and Dental Facility, which correspond to civilian facility types of the same name. This project type will house outpatient medical and dental treatment functions. It is intended to be similar to medical clinics and dental clinics in the private sector community.  The Medical/Dental Clinic will provide medical and dental treatment facilities to support U.S. Army Modular Force restructuring actions at Fort Campbell. The Clinic will serve Active Duty Soldiers only. The GSF as indicated in the PFD shall be 43,176 GSF maximum (29,444 GSF Medical Clinic + 13,732 GSF Dental Clinic). Required parking spaces for the Medical/Dental Clinic D-B RFP are calculated in accordance with UFC 4-510-01 Table 1-1.  Currently, this calculation yields a requirement for 215 parking spaces.<BR>It is the Armys objective that these buildings will have a 25-year useful design life before a possible re-use/re-purpose or renovation requirement, to include normal sustainment, restoration, modernization activities and a 50-year building replacement life. Therefore, the design and construction should provide an appropriate level of quality to ensure the continued use of the facility over that time period with the application of reasonable preventive maintenance and repairs that would be industry-acceptable to a major civilian sector project OWNER. Modular construction is not acceptable. The site infrastructure will have at least a 50-year life expectancy with industry-accepted preventive maintenance and repair cycles. The intent of the Government is to emphasize the functional/operational requirements. Materials and methods shall be the most appropriate Type of Construction allowed by code and criteria for this occupancy/project. The design shall develop the project site for efficiency and to convey a sense of unity or connectivity with the adjacent buildings and with the Installation as a whole.  Provide all site improvements necessary to support the new building facilities. The D-B Contractor shall meet the requirements to be provided in the RFP and use his engineering judgment to develop a site plan for this Medical/Dental Clinic site.<BR>It is the stated desire of the Government that this Medical/Dental Clinic project shall comply with principals and requirements to achieve Silver Level of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating. Solutions that conserve energy, improve workplace habitability and can be justified by life cycle cost analysis as cost effective are encouraged. Public Law 102-486, Executive Order 12423, and Federal Regulations 10 CFR 433 requires government to design and construct facilities in an energy-conserving manner while considering life cycle cost over the life of the facilities. The CFR requires that the design meet ASHRAE Standard 90.1  2004 and, to the extent of life cycle cost effectiveness, achieve energy consumption levels that are at least 30% below the levels of the baseline building using the method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE Standard 90.1  2004. Sustainability shall be a consideration throughout the process of project development from inception. Logistical Responsibility for Building Systems shall be as indicated in UFC 4-510-01 Design: Medical Military Facilities (May 2007) Section 1, FIGURE 1-2. Logistical Responsibility for Medical Equipment shall be as indicated in Section 15: Medical and Dental Equipment of UFC 4-510-01 Design: Medical Military Facilities (May 2007).<BR>Demolition in the scope of this project includes removal, to a depth of 5 feet, of anything encountered that interferes with installation of the building substructure. A future addition to the Medical/Dental Clinic is planned as part of the Grow The Army program that will add medical treatment facilities to the Medical/Dental Clinic sufficient to provide medical treatment for both Active Duty Soldiers and their dependents. The addition is NOT part of this project.  <BR>The Medical/Dental Clinic and the GTA addition shall be required to provide a future 20% expansion of the Medical Clinic area, the Dental Clinic area and the parking area(s) that may be accomplished without alteration to the Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) measures installed under the scope of this Design-Build RFP. The future expansions shall be at zero cost to this Design-Build project.<BR>The estimated price range for this project is from $10 to $25 million.  This procurement is being advertised as full and open. This is a construction request for proposal and will be awarded to a prime construction contractor to be responsible for the design and construction.  Proposals will be evaluated using a best value source selection process.  The selection process will consist of two phases:  the first phase will evaluate such factors as Specialized Experience, Past Performance, Organization and Technical Approach.  Upon completion of that evaluation, up to 5 offerors will be invited to propose on Phase II.  Phase II will evaluate factors such as a more in-depth Technical and Management Approach and the Price. Pro Forma Information such as bonding, financial capability and subcontracting plan will also be required to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to the price. This solicitation will be issued on or about 10 December 2008 and proposals will be due on or about 9 January 2009. The solicitation and any amendments will be available for download from the Internet only.  Downloading of the project documents requires registration at the FedBizOpps website at www.fbo.gov. Registration at www.ccr.gov is required. The NAICS code is 236220, size standard $31 million.  This announcement serves as the advanced notice for this project.  Amendments will be available from the FedBizOPpps website download only.  ALL questions shall be submitted to debra.c.bruner@usace.army.mil.<BR>
