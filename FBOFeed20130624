<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command , Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, has a requirement in support of PM-Force Sustainment Systems for the Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System Light and Heavy (ALVADS-L/H).  The intent of the ALVADS-L/H program is to identify a new parachute which will replace the G-11 cargo parachute and will ensure load survivability at lower altitudes while being more cost effective than the G-11 over its lifecycle.  The Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System's (ALVADS) is a suite of options when distribution of supplies and equipment is required by aerial delivery.  ALVADS consists of five components:  Component I - ALVADS Extraction Parachute Jettison System (EPJS), Component II - ALVADS Light, Component III - ALVADS Heavy, Component IV - ALVADS Advanced Cargo Parachute Release System (ACPRS), and Component V - ALVADS Rapid Rigging and De-rigging Airdrop System (RRDAS).  Component I ALVADS EPJS has already achieved a MS C Decision and has been initially fielded.  Component IV ALVADS ACPRS is currently pursuing a MS C, Type Classification and Full Materiel Release Decision.  Based on the US Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) priorities list for ALVADS and the recent decision to combine the Light and Heavy requirements, ALVADS Light/Heavy capability is the next priority.  The Government anticipates awarding several Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the base effort with a down select to one for the remaining portion of the contract.  Funds will be obligated for quantities ordered upon issuance of delivery orders and not by the basic contract.  The contract guaranteed minimum is $80,000.00.  The contract maximum shall not exceed $15,000,000.00.  Market Research has been conducted by technical experts, and has shown that this requirement will be procured under Full and Open Competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 314999.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 2399 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. Anticipated RFP Release on the Natick Contracting Division's website https://www3.natick.army.mil will be on or about July 11th 2013.  Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Roberta Boswell, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at roberta.f.boswell.civ@mail.mil.

The associated NAICS code is 611512 Flight Training and the Small Business size standard is $25.5 M. Proposals shall be good for 180 calendar days after close of proposal period. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is applicable, with an assigned rating of DO-A1. A Sources Sought Notice was published in the FedBizOpps on 1 March 2012, where more than two small businesses responded that were judged to be able to meet the requirements. Based on this and other Market Research, a determination was made to set the effort aside 100% for Small Business. Therefore, only qualified Small Business offerors may submit their Proposals for the anticipated Solicitation.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for Training, Logistics Support, and Technical / Program Management for a full spectrum of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) and Parts required to support the SUAS Product Office (PdO) in CONUS and OCONUS, and its domestic and foreign customers. The Army has a requirement to sustain/maintain the 1798 RQ-11B and 325 RQ-20A systems currently fielded, and alternative medium and long range systems procured in the future.</p>
<p>The objective of the SUAS Support Program is to support the Warfighters as well as other Governmental<br />Agencies (OGAs) and Non-Governmental Agencies users' SUAS-related sustainment needs. These needs<br />primarily include SUAS training, maintenance, repairs, and engineering services. Additionally, the SUAS PdO will require various non-SETA logistics, technical management, and program management services to support its SUAS customers. The approximate percentage of effort in each area of focus is: Flight Training - 60%, Contractor Logistics - 35%, Technical/Program Management - 5%.</p>
<p>Complete individual instructor flight packets shall be submitted as part of the offeror's proposal for evaluation by the PM UAS GFR. Instructor flight packets will include the following four items: two DD forms 1821 (one each for RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma, IAW Attachment 4, AR 95-20); Crewmember resume; two DD Forms 2627 (one each for RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma, IAW Attachment 3, AR 95-20); FAA Medical Certification (Class 33 or higher). Note: Offerors shall provide with their proposal no less than fourteen (14) Individual Instructor Flight Packets for proposed GFR Certified instructors. The resume portion of the packet shall indicate if the person is a current employee or a contingency hire upon award.</p>
<p>SUAS Trainers shall be certified on all SUAS products available from the Army inventory (currently RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma). While the below table is not a training schedule, it provides the minimum workforce required in the post-award period. The offerors shall be able to show its ability to reach these workforce levels. For example, 14 GFR-certified Puma trainers will be required for various training missions in MAY 2013 (6 in OEF, 8 in CONUS). In JUNE 2013, the required Puma trainers will increase from 14 to18, and 10 Raven trainers will also be required. This escalation continues until 22 Puma trainers, and 22 Raven trainers are available to conduct the anticipated maximum training density (total of 44 interchangeable trainers). <br />Note: actual training schedules will be published as a formal requirement in subsequent Task Orders, post-IDIQ award. The below table is not to be interpreted as a schedule, and as such it is not guaranteed that the maximum training density will be required in August or September, etc.</p>
<p>Training Workforce Needed (Time Phased Escalation)<br />MAY <br />(begins on 29 APR) JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER <br />Qty Airframe Qty Airframe Qty Airframe Qty Airframe Qty Airframe <br />14 Puma 18 Puma 22 Puma 22 Puma 22 Puma <br />10 Raven 14 Raven 22 Raven 22 Raven etc...<br />14 Total 28 Total 36 Total 44 Total 44 Total <br />*Note: Trainers will be interchangeable, and must be certified on both Raven and Puma</p>
<p><br />A Single award, Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is most appropriate to support this effort. The contract Period of Performance (PoP) is five years with a Base Period of three years, and 2 one-year option periods with CLINS 0001-00XX are applicable to the Base Period, CLINS 1001-10XX will apply to the first option period, and CLINS 2001-20XX will apply to the last option period.

These instruments are highly complex and maintenance and repair requires a high degree of technical proficiency and training. In order to ensure readiness to respond in the event of a chemical/biological terrorist event or in the case of an environmental emergency, it is crucial that these instruments are functional and able to perform the required analysis.<br />&nbsp;

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>* Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>* Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. * Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. * Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed. * Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o Protester's name o Address o Telephone number o Fax number o Solicitation or contract number o Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name o Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o Copies of all relevant documents o Request for a ruling o Request for relief <BR> <BR>* Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. * Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o Terminate the contract o Recompete the requirement o Issue a new solicitation o Refrain from exercising options under the contract o Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>* Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). * Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 52.233-4703 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM 05/01/2004 If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract.

<DESC>The draft BOA will not be posted to either the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ or the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  If an interested party wishes to see the draft BOA, a copy will be made available upon request.

Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center intends to issue a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-13-G-GR07 on a sole source basis to Communications and Power Industries, LLC, 811 Hansen Way, Palo Alto, CA  94304-1031 for the engineering support for the SDR, CWI, NULKA, Klystron, Power Grid Tube/Tetrode and Government Furnished Equipment accountability and repair.
  The anticipated total value of this action is $12,400,000.00. 

The BOA will be placed in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). The ordering period of the BOA is five years. The basis for restricting competition was the lack of sufficient technical data, restricted software rights, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirement through any other source. Since this is a sole source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the internet.
 Responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane.  

This synopsis is issued to advertise the BOA and requirements that will be met through orders placed under the BOA for a one year period. 

The Contractor must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration database, located at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Western Ecological Research Center (WERC), has a requirement for study of the ranging behaviors of Main Hawaiian Island (MHI) seabirds.  Participants in this study require approval under the Endangered Species Act by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and permission by the Hawaii State Department of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) based on demonstrable experience and technical expertise handling protected seabird species (e.g., Wedge-tailed Shearwater, albatrosses, boobies and tropicbirds). Tri-isle Resource Conservation and Development, Maui, Hawaii is, to the USGS's knowledge, the only known source with the necessary research background involving multiple Hawaiian seabird species, and is authorized under federal banding and auxiliary marking authority to attach tracking devices to these species.  Therefore, the government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.501 to Tri-isle Resource Conservation and Development, Inc. Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 0700 Pacific Time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, solicitation G13PS00489 will be made available to Tri-isle Resource Conservation and Development on or about 06/26/2013. This notice and any resulting solicitation or purchase order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-66, effective 01 Apr 2013.  NAICS 541712, Biology Research & Development Lab or Services for which the associated size standard is 500.

<DESC> <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a solicitation set aside for certified small business contractors for the repair of the wharf located along the east side of the Block Island Harbor, Block Island, Rhode Island.  The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990, size standard of $33.5M.  The project is planned to be issued in April 2013 as a Small Business Lowest Bid award. The construction will begin after the summer tourist season, and extend over one-two months.  Cost will be in $100,000 to $200,000 range.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District. <br>  <br> The work of this project involves repairing a wharf damaged by the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy.  The wharf is located on the eastern side of the inner basin of old harbor on Block Island, Rhode Island, and is in front of Ballard's Inn.  Numerous inboard pile caps have become elevated above the tops of the inboard timber piles.  The work involves removing some of the 4 quote mark  x 10 quote mark  deck planks and timber wheel guards in order to provide access to the pile caps.  Sand and rip rap will need to be excavated or moved around each of the inboard piles in order to provide the room necessary to reseat the pile caps on top of the piles.  Once the pile caps are reseated on the inboard piles, steel straps (two per pile) will be installed at each pile, including the outboard piles.  No excavation is necessary at the outboard piles.  After the pile caps have been reseated and the straps installed, the existing timber decking and timber wheel guards shall be reinstalled using existing hardware.  In addition, the inboard fascia board shall be replaced in-kind and two ladders on the outboard face of the wharf shall be replaced. <br>  <br> The work of the project requires construction operations immediately adjacent to a busy public restaurant.  Barricades and chain link safety fencing shall be installed in this location to separate the general public from the active construction areas of the project.  The barricades and safety fencing shall be installed prior to the start of all other onsite activities.  The Contractor shall modify and implement other construction methods as necessary to ensure the safety of the public in this area. <br>  <br> Please note this solicitation is set aside for certified small businesses under the applicable NAICS code 237990, size standard of $33.5M. This is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about April 16, 2013.  Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted.  The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely to gather information for planning and market research purposes, and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e) and FAR 52.215-3, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated or paid for information solicited by it. This is not a request for proposals; and therefore the Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice. All information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Proprietary information should be clearly marked, and respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information furnished must comply with the Security Exchange Commission's confidential treatment regulations at 17 C.F.R. 200.83. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review of the information provided, but may be contacted for additional information for clarification. <br>  <br> The overall scope of this project is to improve the Radio Frequnency (RF) coverage of Bulls-Eye Flight Following into the training areas on Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), WA. A contract was awarded to Lockheed  Martin to complete Phase 1 of this effort, primarily by configuring and installing a microwave radio system at Capitol Peak, Beal Hill, and  Gray Army Airfield. For improved coverage, a new radio location has been selected.  The new location will be located on the tower at Capitol Peak (CP), just South of Olympia, Washington.  Phase 2, the focus of this RFI, will require a system capable of remote maintenance and remote tuning with the  ability to simultaneously transmit from multiple (minimum of 3) locations and provide the strongest receiver signal from multiple (minimum of 3) locations to the air traffic controller at Bulls Eye Airspace Information Center (AIC) on Gray AAF JBLM, WA. <br>  <br>  <br> Phase One: <br> Lockheed Martin is on contract to complete all the effort that follow under Phase One.  Due to the physical elevation and RF noise congestion from other towers co-located on Capitol Peak, the new site will require radios with enhanced filtering capabilities. Co-location mitigation will be achieved through the use of internal, software-controlled filters; and internal, fixed frequency band-pass filters for both the UHF and VHF CM-300/350 radios. The frequency-agile VHF and UHF URC-200 back-up radios will feature remotely-tuned external band-pass filters. <br>  <br> Physical rack space is limited at Capitol Peak to three, 45RU high, 19 inch racks for the entire system.  A total of nine radio sets, associated RF lines, auto-tune band-pass filters, and antennas will have to be installed at this location. The radio network at Capitol Peak will be connected to a Fast Ethernet-terminated microwave network (100 mbps minimum throughput) that will bring the voice and data traffic back to an existing tower on Beal Hill.   <br>  <br> Fiber-optic lines are available at Beal Hill, and will terminate on the 3rd floor of the ATC tower at Gray Army Airfield.  These existing fiber-optic lines will provide the voice/data path between Beal Hill and the ATC tower. The fiber optic lines will be converted to a Lockheed Martin -furnished Fast Ethernet connection, and cabled by the Lockheed Martin to the 4th Floor. The 4th floor equipment space will house the Lockheed Martin -furnished Fast Ethernet (100 mbps) drop in direct proximity to the planned ATC tower rack space for the Seller delivered Baseline tower equipment, residing in an existing Government equipment rack (one 45RU rack). The Government will ensure space, power, and cable run provisions are met for the Lockheed Martin -furnished ATC tower Baseline equipment rack. The Lockheed Martin delivered Baseline equipment will interface with the 4-Wire E&M signaling, as connected to an existing DENRO Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch (ETVS), which also resides on the 4th floor equipment room, to complete the signal path. The aggregate throughput of the LM-furnished data link from the Gray Army Airfield tower to Capitol Peak shall be no less than 100 mbps with 100% availability. <br>  <br> Lockheed Martin has responsibility for the 100 mbps aggregate data link, including: the Fast Ethernet drop in the 4th floor of the ATC tower; ATC tower Fast Ethernet to fiber optic connectivity; fiber optic link from the ATC tower to Beal Hill; fiber optic to microwave connectivity at Beal Hill; microwave link from Beal Hill to Capitol Peak; microwave link to Fast Ethernet connectivity at Capitol Peak; and the Fast Ethernet drop at Capitol Peak. <br>  <br> Due to the geographical elevation of Capitol Peak and local weather patterns, site access is limited during the winter months due to snow, ice, and road conditions.  This greatly limits the window in which maintenance personnel can recover from any equipment-related outages.  For this reason, it is extremely crucial that every portion of the system design have redundancy as well as remote access capabilities built-in. <br>  <br> Once completed, the new Bulls-Eye AIC Radio System on Capitol Peak will improve coverage into the training areas and enhance the safety and welfare of both aircraft crews operating in these areas as well as training personnel on the ground. <br>  <br>  <br> Phase Two: <br> As part of a second Phase, PM ATC is releasing this RFI to obtain information from industry  on their capability to integrate and their ability to simultaneously transmit from multiple (minimum of 3) locations and provide the strongest receiver signal from multiple (minimum of 3) locations to the air traffic controller at Bulls Eye Airspace Information Center (AIC) on Gray AAF JBLM WA.  Solution shall build upon the currently contracted solution to place CM300V1 radios on Capitol Peak with maintenance and control from Gray AAF, JBLM, WA.  Solution shall be modeled after simulcast transmits and receiver voting systems. One spare of each unique type of radio shall be provided to JBLM WA.  Each radio shall carry with coverage until the year 2025.  Solution shall encompass the current Capitol Peak and Donovan Hill radio locations plus one future location TBD.  Guard frequency radios (VHF and UHF) and Airspace Information Center (AIC) radios (VHF, UHF, and FM) shall require the simulcast and voter system capability.  Range Information System (RIS) is a transmit only system and does not require simulcast capability. <br>  <br> Companies shall provide information on the materials and services necessary to meet the above requirements.  They will be required to l ensure that all work is performed with appropriately licensed, certified and bonded personnel as required. <br> Companies shall provide information concerning their capabilities to  install their System. Each radio shall have an independent RF coaxial line and radiating antenna element mounted on an existing antenna tower.  Due to the limited accessibility of Capitol Peak, the Capitol Peak radio equipment will need to support remote maintenance. Due to physical elevation and RF noise congestion from other antenna towers co-located on Capitol Peak, the newly installed radios will require enhanced filtering capabilities.  Further, due to the limited accessibility of Capitol Peak, the Capitol Peak radio equipment will need to support remote maintenance and tuning.  <br>  <br> Interested sources shall provide information that supports their capabilities to perform the following test: and technical support: <br>  <br> Functional System Test - perform a functional test which includes system power-up, a transmit and receive functionality demonstration from ATC Tower to Capitol Peak, and a remote maintenance and control demonstration.   <br>  <br> Post Install Tech Support - provide post install technical support related to installed radio equipment, which includes a maximum of 80 labor hours and travel expenses for a 3-day trip for one person to JBLM. <br>  <br> Phase II include installation of Radios with Simulcast Capability between Donovan Hill and Capitol Peak. At Donovan Hill Site, removal of the existing CM-300 V(1) and PRC-117 (FM) radio systems and antennas currently installed if required. Removed equipment will be turned over to site personnel for disposition. <br> Currently installed equipment at Donovan Hill: <br> *50W transmitter and receiver, AIC VHF frequency 141.500 MHz <br> *50W transmitter and receiver, AIC UHF frequency 379.100 MHz <br> *50W transceiver, AIC FM frequency 34.600 MHz <br> *Donovan Hill does not have any RIS transmitters <br> *Donovan Hill does not have transmitters or receivers for 121.500 or 243.000 <br> *Fiber is already in use for VHF, UHF and FM from ATCT to Donovan. <br>  <br> Effort at the Capitol Peak and Donovan Hill Sites include: installation of two simulcast/voting capable radio systems (UHF/VHF), one FM Radio system (FM), backup power supply, and GPS equipment for frequencies 141.500 and 379.100. If required, installation of new antennas on the existing tower for the new radio systems. Existing antenna cables may be utilized. At CP, integrate 141.500, 379.100, and 34.600 radios into the simulcast and voter systems. At Gray AAF, integrate 121.500 and 243.00 into the simulcast and voter system with the second set of radios. <br>  <br> This effort will also include integration of new radio systems to the Bulls Eye Flight Following Communication System to the Gray Army Airfield using existing fiber optic terminations.  At Gray Army Airfield, install new simulcast system and voting system in existing rack space on the 4th floor equipment room. At Capitol Peak, removal of the existing CM-300 V(1) radio systems and antennas currently installed if  required. <br>  <br> Capitol Peak, under current contract, will have: <br> *50W transmitter and receiver, AIC VHF frequency 141.500 MHz <br> *50W transmitter and receiver, AIC UHF frequency 379.100 MHz <br> *50W transceiver, AIC FM frequency 34.600 MHz <br> *10W transmitter, RIS VHF frequency (TBD) MHz <br> *10W transmitter, RIS UHF frequency (TBD) MHz <br> *50W transmitter and receiver, Guard VHF frequency 121.500 MHz <br> *50W transmitter and receiver, Guard UHF frequency 243.000 MHz <br> *50W transceiver, Backup VHF tunable <br> *50W transceiver, Backup UHF tunable <br>  <br> A functional test the new system is required.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration, in conjunction with The Department of Defense, is seeking to obtain industry comment and input on the technical and commercial feasibility of executing a targeted acquisition of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) as well as supporting charging infrastructure &amp; vehicle storage management for Federal agencies of the United States of America. The Federal Government has an interest in accelerating the adoption of Plug in Electric vehicles (PEVs) within its light duty, non-tactical ground fleets located within states that have adopted the California Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) program. The ZEV program is intended to accelerate the adoption of alternative powered, zero emission-super low emission vehicles within the respective states that have adopted this standard. <br /><br />The Department of Defense, in conjunction with the General Services Administration (GSA) is interested in exploring its ability to achieve competitive commercial lease pricing on Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV) sedan vehicle models by leveraging the requirements set forth by California's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Program through the execution of a single commercial lease. Additionally, the proposed program intends to incorporate additional leasing arrangements for charging infrastructure, specific data collection regarding energy usage, and parking accommodations at Federal facilities within the targeted regions.
<p>GSA, on behalf of the Department of Defense, is seeking information from interested parties including, but not limited to: original equipment manufacturers for light duty vehicles and charging equipment, fleet management organizations, public &amp; private sector vehicle parking &amp; storage sources, public &amp; private transportation &amp; energy infrastructure developers, industry consultants in the field of commercialization electric vehicles &amp; charging infrastructure, commercial financing firms, and entities engaged in vehicle leasing.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Policy Support (OPS) in the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is seeking a contractor to review a report summarizing States' vendor peer group systems, including the criteria used to establish peer groups, the competitive price criteria and maximum allowable reimbursement levels within each vendor peer group, and the methodology used to establish the criteria. The report examined all 90 State agencies' State Plans across 50 States, the District of Columbia, 34 Indian Tribal Organizations, the District of Columbia, and five Territories (the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). The contractor for the anticipated study will use the report to identify competitive pricing strategies and vendor peer group systems, both current and ideal, that are or could be effective at cost containment and that can be applied and potentially implemented in all States.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to determine the interest of potential partners in financially investing in the development of new technology for an agricultural instrument. Interested parties including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) are asked to provide capability statements. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. NASA is seeking specific information on interest in such a partnership and conditions under which such a partnership would be viable. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take procurement action in this matter. Furthermore, neither NASA, nor the Government will be responsible for any costs incurred in furnishing this information. BACKGROUND NASA is performing market research for the Farmland and Agriculture Remote Measurement Sensor (FARMS) study project and is looking for hardware development and/or software development partners, willing to financially invest in the development of new technology for an agricultural instrument. The investment sought would involve the development of an instrument that will be externally mounted on the International Space Station (ISS) on an Earth viewing docking post. The intent of the instrument is to collect hyperspectral data on crops and farmland for the purpose of increasing agricultural productivity and performing early assessment of crop disease and stress, as well as, conducting farmland output assessment. This instrument will be flown as a proof of concept to assess in-space flight adequacy and efficiency of collected data. Commercial partner(s) will have rights to the data in relationship to their investment and downstream use of the technology if determined that a spacecraft agricultural system has commercial viability.  See additional FARMS background information in the attached information sheet titled, "FARMS Flyer_SSCO. The range of total commercial investment sought is between $20M and $50M.  Multiple partners are sought. INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS Parties who are interested in establishing an early commercial foothold in very specific agricultural data from space are invited to submit their electronic response to this Sources Sought Notice no later than July 8th 2013, 5pm EDT.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />A. Background</span></strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. It was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Purpose and Objectives:</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide cutting edge methodology for untargeted detection of pathological changes in the carnitine species, lipids, isoprostanes and metabolic profiles of fluid from 200 individuals with neurological disorders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Contractor shall provide comprehensive quantitative analysis of the following</span>:<br /><br />1. carnitine, acylcarnitine and butyrobetaine species in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and urine using UHPLC-MS/MS;<br />2. lipidomic and phospholipid analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid using HPLC-MS;<br />3. metabolomic analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid and urine using HPLC-MS; and<br />4. isoprostane species in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and urine using ChipCube chromatography-MS/MS.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. Scope of Work</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specifically the contractor shall:</span></p>
<p>1. Provide a validated, UHPLC-MS/MS method for the accurate quantification, resolution of acylcarnitineisomers (e.g. butyryl- and isobutyrylcarnitine; valeryl-, isovaleryl-, 2-methyl-butyryl- and pivaloylcarnitine), remove isobaric contaminants, and use standardized compounds with multiple-point calibration curves. This analytical method allows individual acylcarnitines to be accurately quantitated. Butyrobetaine shall also be analyzed using stable-isotope labeled butyrobetaine as the internal standard. These analyses shall be performed on cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and urine. Unrecognized compounds in a sample will be further analyzed if considered to be associated with the patient's condition.<br />2. Provide untargeted quantitative lipid and phospholipid analysis of cerebrospinal fluid body using HPLC-MS.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for a commercial acquisition. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and Eastern Acquisition Division are conducting market research to determine potential sources capable of upgrading an existing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system. Specifically, NOAA has two Riegl topographic LIDAR systems having a part number of LMS-Q680i, one of which is required to be upgraded to a topographic-bathymetric LIDAR system having the part number of VQ-820-G. The original manufacture of the topographic LIDAR systems is Riegl USA, Orlando, Florida.
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing. The small business standard for this NAICS code is 750 employees. This is not a request for technical or cost proposals. All types of business concerns, both large and small, are encouraged to submit a brief, typed Capability Statement in response to this sources sought announcement demonstrating their capability to provide the required system upgrade to topographical-bathymetric.</p>
<p>The topographic-bathymetric LIDAR upgrade(s) may include: 1) Upgrade hardware, software, and support components of an existing Riegl LMS-Q680i topographic LIDAR to a Riegl VQ-820-G combination topographic-bathymetric LIDAR; 2) Provide a POSTrac AV 510 (IMU-8 US Origin Non-ITAR) as part of the upgrade; 3) Topographic range of up to 3000 meters (m) for high-reflectance surfaces; 4) Hydrographic operational depth range of up to 1 Secchi depth; 5) Achievable ranging accuracy of 25 millimeters (mm) or better; 6) Maximum effective measurement rate of 200 kilohertz (kHz) or higher during bathymetry acquisition; 7) Capable of operating through an 18 inch optical flat or open port, with a maximum, unpressurized altitude of at least 16,000 ft (~4900 m) above mean sea level (MSL); 8) 28 volts DC / 35 amp maximum combined electrical requirement for sensor and control systems; 9) laser beam divergence &lt; 2 milliradians (mrad); and 10) the execution of the remaining warranty and maintenance term on the upgraded system. NOAA requires the capability to collect seamless, high-resolution elevation data on both sides of the land water interface, including in the marine nearshore zone to depths of approximately 5 meters. To meet this need, an airborne topographic-bathyConmetric LIDAR system, capable of simultaneously mapping both the subaqueous and subaerial areas of the coastal zone is required.</p>
<p>In addition to the upgrade of the existing system to the a topographic-bathymetric, NOAA is interested in future system developments that will be available in the next year.NOAA has a number of unique requirements for a topographic-bathymetric ("topo-bathy") LIDAR system in order to satisfy NOAA and partner agency data needs while simultaneously ensuring compatibility with NOAA aircraft and existing workflows. The following is a list of specific criteria:<br />&bull; The maximum depth penetration must be at least 1.7/Kd, where Kd is the diffuse attenuation coefficient.<br />&bull; Must provide continuous, simultaneously-acquired, very high -resolution data across the backshore, intertidal, and shallow (0-4 m) nearshore zones for shoreline mapping, coastal change, and inundation modeling. To enable mapping of the shallowest areas, the transmit pulse width cannot exceed 2 nanoseconds (ns) (full width at half maximum), the total system response function cannot exceed 3.5 ns, and the beam divergence cannot exceed 2 milliradians (mrad). <br />&bull; Must have a maximum effective measurement rate of &gt; 250 killohertz (kHz) for both topography and bathymetry acquisition. Note that this specification is for the measurement rate, not the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Depending on the type of scan mechanism used, the PRF may exceed the measurement rate.<br />&bull; To enable effective mapping of the land-water interface, topographic and bathymetric data acquisition must occur simultaneously (i.e., separate topo and bathy acquisition modes are unacceptable).<br />&bull; To integrate the system without requiring modifications to NOAA aircraft, the system must have a similar form factor, power requirements, and weight &amp; balance considerations to LIDAR systems currently owned and operated by NOAA on the King Air 350ER (N68RF). In particular, the total weight cannot exceed 50 kg (110 lbs), and power consumption cannot exceed 300 W. The length and width cannot exceed 50 cm (20 inches), and the height cannot exceed 75 cm (30 inches). In addition, there should be no rack-mounted electronics components required, other than for the GPS/IMU system.<br />&bull; To maintain adherence to existing laser safety protocols, the laser class cannot exceed III b (or 3R under the IEC 60825-1 standard). <br />Firms who believe they have the capabilities to provide the required hardware and software components to upgrade a topographical LIDAR system to a topographical-bathymetric LIDAR system that will meet all the requirements specified herein must furnish detailed information concerning their capabilities. Submitted Capability Statements shall include the following: (1) Company name and address, (2) DUNS number, (3) Type of business (e.g., large business, small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and/or women owned small business) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (4) Company point of contact - name, phone and Email address, and (5) Demonstration of the capabilities possessed for meeting the requirement. <br />Businesses shall submit an electronic copy of the requested information to Robin Resweber, Contract Specialist, via email at Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov, no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) July 2, 2013. Responses will not be returned. Any questions or responses to this Sources Sought announcement shall be directed to Robin Resweber via the email address provided. No feedback will be provided regarding individual Capability Statements. Information received will be considered solely to make informed decisions regarding a potential procurement. Responses to the Sources Sought announcement are not offers and cannot be accepted by NOAA to form a binding contract. No reimbursement for costs will be made associated with providing information in response to this sources sought announcement or follow-up information requests, if applicable.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside.  The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 336413 which has a corresponding size standard of 1000 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement.  The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.  The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code.
  Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.  Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. 

This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the Government.  DLA Aviation at Philadelphia anticipates possible award of a contract  to execute a Performance Based program in support of various supplies consisting of consumable NSNs for  support of the AV-8B, AH-64, CH-46, CH-47, F/A-18, F-15, KC-135, B-2, B-52, B-1 and E-3.
   Depot Level Repairable (DLR) NSNs are anticipated to be added at a later phase in the program.  All of the supplies will be provided under a performance based construct with availability metrics used to gauge contractor performance. Other metrics may be included. The contractor will be paid based on the aggregate demands or other appropriate measurements of usage of the specific weapon systems. The items that will be included in this contract are currently procured under various contracts with the DLA, USAF, USA and USN.  The contract will also include necessary support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The anticipated Contract will be strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for procurement of a wide range of supplies.
 Various Government approved operational sites will be supported by this effort. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies to Government wholesale and retail supply points both CONUS and OCONUS within specified time windows and at contractor expense.   Performance will include a five year base period with one five year option to extend the contract for a total performance period of ten years. 

The Boeing Company is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of these items with design control, authorization, and documentation to manufacture.  Boeing owns the limited data rights to these items.  The Government does not have the drawings or complete data packages. However, some demand data is available by request.
  

Under a Performance Based contract, a Contractor will carry out logistics functions for the specified items while meeting daily Services demand requirements (i.e., filling various Services requisitions) within a specified response time to CONUS and OCONUS destinations.  DLA requires strategies that would include partnering with Government entities such as Organic Depots.  

Performance Based functions generally include: demand forecasting, inventory management, warehousing, configuration management, obsolescence management, training, and sustaining engineering/ maintaining reliability. There are approximately 15,971 consumable items to be covered by this contract with approximately 4,600 to be maintained under Performance Based criteria, with flexibility/processes to add more items including DLRs as requirements dictate.
 Items not covered by the Performance Based metric will be handled as stock items at full lead times

The contract will be constructed to allow for the addition of Consumable Parts and Depot Level Repairables (DLRs) to the initial population post-award.  An initial consumable population of up to 15,971 items has been identified. A full list of NIINs and the respective FSCs is attached.

Likewise, this RFI does not represent an official Acquisition Plan, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to any course of action in the future. This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning, and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement. The Government does not intend to award a contract based solely on responses to this RFI, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.<br />Each respondent, by submitting a Response, agrees that any cost incurred by it in responding to this request or in support of activities associated with this RFI shall be the sole responsibility of respondent.

The SFSS demonstration unit will be qualified in multiple configurations in a laboratory environment to demonstrate potential SFSS capabilities with other weapons in their flight test environments before being integrated into the JASSM platform. Work to be performed encompasses design, development, test, and flight test associated with weapon system level certification. LMMFC has proprietary knowledge of the JASSM weapon system, which is the only approved weapon system for SFSS demonstration. In addition, LMMFC has extensive integration experience with the full spectrum of technologies associated with integration, qualification, and test of weapon safety systems, and associated telemetry applications.</p>

<p>Proposed Establishment of a Federally Funded Research and Development Center-<br />Second Notice</p>
<p><br />AGENCY: 	National Institute of Standards and Technology, Department of Commerce</p>
<p>ACTION:	Notice<br />SUMMARY:	The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Commerce, intends to sponsor a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) to facilitate public-private collaboration for accelerating the widespread adoption of integrated cybersecurity tools and technologies.  This is the second of three notices which must be published over a 90-day period in order to advise the public of the agency's intention to sponsor an FFRDC.<br /><br />DATES:  Written comments must be received by 5:00 PM Eastern time on July 22, 2013.  <br /><br />ADDRESSES:  Comments on this notice must be submitted to Keith Bubar either electronically at keith.bubar@nist.gov, or at:<br /><br />Keith Bubar<br />NIST<br />100 Bureau Drive Mail Stop 1640<br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640</p>

<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <br />The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), hosted by NIST, is a public-private collaboration for accelerating the widespread adoption of integrated cybersecurity tools and technologies.  The NCCoE will bring together experts from industry, government and academia under one roof to develop practical, interoperable cybersecurity approaches that address the real world needs of complex Information Technology (IT) systems.  By accelerating dissemination and use of these integrated tools and technologies for protecting IT assets, the NCCoE will enhance trust in U.S. IT communications, data, and storage systems, lower risk for companies and individuals in the use of IT systems, and encourage development of innovative, job-creating cybersecurity products and services.</p>
<p>NIST has identified the need to support the NCCoE's mission through the establishment of an FFRDC.  In evaluating the need for the FFRDC, NIST determined that no existing FFRDC or contract vehicles provide the scope of services NIST requires. The proposed NCCoE FFRDC will have three primary purposes:  (1) Research, Development, Engineering and Technical support; (2) Program/Project Management, to include but not limited to expert advice and guidance in the areas of program and project management focused on increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of cybersecurity applications, prototyping, demonstrations, and technical activities; and (3) Facilities Management.   The proposed NCCoE FFRDC may also be utilized by non-sponsors.<br /><br />The FFRDC will be established under the authority of 48 CFR 35.017.</p>
<p>The NCCoE FFRDC Contractor will be available to provide a wide range of support including, but not limited to:<br /><br /><strong>&bull;	Research, Development, Engineering and Technical Support:</strong><br />- Establish relationships with private sector organizations to use private sector resources to accomplish tasks that are integral to the operations and mission of the NCCoE.<br />- Research and develop frameworks and implementation strategies for inducing industry to invest in and expedite adoption of effective cybersecurity controls and mechanisms on an enterprise-wide scale; and in collaboration with Federal and local governments, deliver planning and documentation support needed to transfer technologies developed by Federal cybersecurity organizations and the NCCoE to production, integration, economic development, and operational implementation entities.<br />- Provide systems engineering support to NCCoE programs and proposed security platform development, selection, and implementation.  This will include NCCoE infrastructure, project planning, project implementation, and technology transfer components of the NCCoE's efforts to accelerate adoption of robust cybersecurity technologies in the government and private sectors.<br />- Generate technical expertise to create a relevant cybersecurity workforce in coordination with the NCCoE staff and in close collaboration with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education and with Federal government, university, and industry participants and collaborators in NCCoE activities.<br />- Deliver strategies and plans for applying cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and best practice inducements and capabilities to both government and private sectors. <br /><br /><strong>&bull;	Program/Project Management:</strong><br />- Work within the purpose, mission, general scope, or competency as assigned by the sponsoring agency.  <br />- Develop and maintain in-depth institutional knowledge of NCCoE programs and operations in order to maintain continuity in the field of cybersecurity and to maintain a high degree of competence, objectivity, and independence in order to respond effectively to the emerging cybersecurity needs of the Nation.<br /><br /><strong>&bull;	Facilities Management:</strong><br />- In coordination with NCCoE staff, and in collaboration with the State of Maryland and Montgomery County, Maryland, manage physical and logical collaborative facilities to support the acceleration and adoption of robust cybersecurity technologies in the government and private sectors.  The activity includes staff support for information technology operations, custodial functions, physical access management, and maintenance operations.<br /><br /><br />The FFRDC will partner with the sponsoring agency in the design and pursuit of mission goals; provide rapid responsiveness to changing requirements for personnel in all aspects of strategic, technical and program management; recognize Government objectives as its own objectives, partner in pursuit of excellence in public service; and allow for use of the FFRDC by non-sponsors.<br />We are publishing this notice in accordance with 48 CFR 5.205(b) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), to enable interested members of the public to provide comments on this proposed action.  This is the second of three notices issued under the authority of 48 CFR 5.205(b). In particular, we are interested in feedback regarding the proposed scope of the work to be performed by the FFRDC, and the presence of any existing private- or public-sector capabilities in this area that NIST should be considering. NIST intends to publicly summarize and address all comments received in response to these notices. <br /><br />It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on FedBizOpps in the summer of 2013.  Alternatively, a copy of the RFP can be obtained by contacting the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION&nbsp;</p>

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a firm fixed price (FFP) job order with Airborne Systems, Llangeinor, Bridgend, CF32 8PL, UK.  The contract will be a follow-on procurement of Mk-59 systems for the IWS2D program office. This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is Airborne Systems being the sole producer of the system and they own the specifications for the system. There is not enough time to find a new vendor and not enough funds to develop this ourselves.
  Since this is a sole source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the internet.  Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane.

Use advanced technical knowledge and communications skills to facilitate complex situations;<br />b. Serve as an advisor for and provide direction with indirect reporting relationships; and<br />c. Interact day-to-day with technologists, management, portfolio/program/project management, contract developers, government developers, and other architects.<br />d. Working with the USPTO technologists and management, refine and document the current and future state architecture of the Trademark systems and propose a migration strategy from the current state to the future state.<br />e. Assess implementation and development efforts to ensure conformity with TM NG strategy, architectures, plans and industry best practices.
<p>PROPOSED CONTRACTOR: Tactical Strategy Group, Inc.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR NON-COMPETITION: <br />The Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) specifically exempts USPTO from the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA - 41 USC 253).</p>
<p>The supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Justification for Sole Source is to obtain approval for negotiating solely with Tactical Strategy Group (TSG), Inc. for Subject Matter Expert services pertaining to the Trademarks Next Generation (TM NG) Portfolio, Program and Projects. Mr. William Ulrich of TSG possesses a unique set of qualifications to provide direction and guidance to the TM-NG Business and IT Architecture teams in the development of the TM-NG current and future state value streams, capability mapping, and IT solutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich has unique ability and expertise to deconstruct business architectures and IT architectures to deliver the cross-functional, cross disciplinary visibility required to enable complex business/IT transformations. Additionally, Mr. Ulrich possesses a unique ability to determine the viability of a given business/IT transformation strategy from a fully independent perspective. Based on this unique ability and experience, the USPTO contracted with TSG for Mr. Ulrich to prepare and deliver an assessment of the proposed TM NG Program.</p>
<p>The resulting report, Trademark Business / IT Transformation Strategy Assessment Report, was submitted on December 16, 2010. There are numerous recommendations in the report that the TM NG Program has accepted and is currently implementing. One of the most significant findings in the report is that TM does not have a Business Architecture (BA). Without a Business Architecture to describe the current and future state of the TM business capability needs, the TM NG Program will not be able to plan and deliver business-driven IT solutions. The report recommendation based on the findings is to create a BA for TM and base the TM NG IT Architecture on the BA. USPTO, OCIO and TM senior leadership accepted this recommendation.</p>
<p>The TM organization did not have the in-house expertise or knowledge to develop a Business Architecture (BA). The decision was made to develop the internal capability and expertise to produce and maintain the TM BA. Mr. Ulrich is uniquely qualified to guide and advise this USPTO BA team through the process of creating the TM BA. With Mr. Ulrich's expertise and guidance, the TM BA was developed in 2012.</p>
<p>The TM BA consists of 17 values streams and identified approximately 170 unique business capabilities that require IT solutions. Seven programs each with multiple projects will be used to develop and deliver the IT solutions that meet the business capability needs expressed in the TM BA. Development contractors will be brought on-board in the fourth quarter of FY12 to begin building the new Trademark Next Generation systems and retire all of the legacy TM systems. The first year of development efforts are critically important to the TM NG portfolio success including the alignment of development efforts to the TM business architecture.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich's unique expertise and experience with the TM BA effort and team is required in order to help translate the TM BA into the TM NG IT Solution Architecture (portfolio/program/project) and ensure that project development efforts meet the TM business needs in a manner consistent with other accepted recommendations from the Trademark Business / IT Transformation Strategy Assessment Report.</p>

<DESC>Annual License Renewal for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Software <br /><br />It is the intent of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to GE Intelligent Platforms, Inc. to renew the annual license for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software. GE Intelligent Platforms, Inc. is the manufacturer and the only source available to provide the licenses and technical support of the complex software. Use of SCADA software is critical in maintaining 24x7x365 operation of the St. Mary's Falls Canal Hydro Power Plant located in Sault Ste. Marie, MI. Hydro plant automation started in 1997; with remote operations starting in 2004. The hydro plant is no longer staffed 24x7x365. This SCADA system is used by the remote operator (located over 800 miles away) to operate all five hydro power generators. The SCADA system is the only means for the remote operator to control the plant; their duties include calling in local operators to address alarms or unusual operating conditions. If this system were to fail, the two available operators cannot maintain and operate this plant 24x7x365. Keeping this software licensed with technical support is critical.<br /><br />Any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a capability statement not-to-exceed two pages to Richard D. Hamilton at richard.d.hamilton@usace.army.mil by the response date stated on this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to acquire a Building Automation System (BAS) for the Defense Information System Agency (DISA), to be used for the DISA Critical Equipment Upgrade Design and Equipment Installation at DECC PAC Bldg 475, JBPHH, Hawaii, under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice does not constitute a request for competitive proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for such a purpose.</p>
<p>Building Automation Systems are centralized, interoperable, networks of hardware and software, which monitor and control the environment in commercial and industrial facilities. While managing various building systems, the automation system ensures the operational performance of the facility as well as the comfort and safety of building occupants. Building automation begins with control of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems. For instance, the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is almost always controlled, including control of its various pieces of equipment such as, chillers, boilers, and air handling units. Other systems that are brought under building automation are power monitoring, security, close circuit video (CCTV), card and keypad access, fire alarm system, plumbing and water monitoring. The end goal of the BAS is to control all systems within a facility and offer the user real-time data in order to resolve system failures before they start.</p>
<p>The DISA BAS enterprise architecture has been developed to provide a standardized platform for operational and maintenance team efficiency. The system provides DISA remote monitoring teams the ability to transition monitoring responsibilities globally in response to local or worldwide events. The standardized BAS platform provides maintenance teams the ability to move technicians from one location to another to support large scale maintenance events and disaster recovery.</p>
<p>DISA must maintain supporting IT systems and the physical infrastructure in facilities consistent with Tier III uptime and redundancy levels as delineated in the governing data center standard, ANSI TIA-942. DISA, Enterprise Services Directorate, Infrastructure Division has translated the technical aspects of ANSI TIA-942 and the Uptime Institute into their Facilities Engineering Standards, DISA CSI 360-95.3.</p>
<p>DISA has spent over two years in developing the technical requirements, standing up a pre production building automation system (for pre implementation testing), ensuring DODI 8500.1 and DODI 8500.2 compliance, and obtaining BAS system accreditation (connection to a DOD network). Mission operational requirements necessitate that this system be capable of providing and receiving input from DISA's Data Center Information Management Tool (DCIM) and Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) tool of which both have been included in the BAS design and resourcing.</p>
<p>Firms wishing to see the salient characteristics of the BAS system are to send their email address to Ms Tristin Matsuki at tristin.n.matsuki@usace.army.mil. Firms will receive a one-time access to a secure site.</p>
<p>Firms believing they have an alternate building automation system that can fully meet the standards of DISA may submit a capabilities statement. The capability statement shall be submitted no later than 2:00 p.m. HST, on July 9, 2013 by email to Ms Tristin Matsuki at tristin.n.matsuki@usace.army.mil. The statement shall include the following:</p>
<p>a. Provide fully detailed specification sheets describing the alternate building automation system offered that are equal to and fully compatible with the specifications. The specification sheets shall specify the manufacturer's name, address and country of manufacture.</p>
<p>b. Provide a narrative, no longer than 5 pages, addressing how the alternate building automation system is fully comparable and compatible with specifications.</p>
<p>c. Provide a narrative, no longer than 2 pages, describing how the alternate BAS system will be accredited to connect to the DOD network or what process is needed to ensure the BAS system will be accredited.</p>
<p>The Government will not assume any costs for preparing or submitting information in response to this announcement.</p>

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: Technical Experimentation (TE) Collaboration<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions to future SOF capabilities. Beginning in FY14, SOF technical experimentation event focus areas and locations are as follows:</p>
<p>15 - 24 October 2013 - Survivability and Performance Improvement /Unconventional Warfare (UW), location Camp Atterbury, IN</p>
<p>February or March 2014 - Maritime Mobility/Counter-Mobility, location TBD, anticipate RFI open late Oct and close early Dec 2013</p>
<p>17-26 June 2014 - Theater Special Operations Command / Partner Nation SOF Systems, location TBD, anticipate RFI open mid-Mar and close early Apr 2014</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 75 to 120 days prior to each scheduled TE event depending on schedule needs to provide additional details of each event.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM sponsored Technical Experimentation event. The TE venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>1. Background: USSOCOM has traditionally conducted Technical Experimentation events at Muscatatuck UTC, IN; at Avon Park, FL, and Camp Roberts, CA. These Technical experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. Technical Experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter. The event facilitates SOCOM personnel to identify potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions brought to the event should be between a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 and 6. Experiments may be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. At the discretion of USSOCOM, respondents may be asked to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment).</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 15 Oct - 24 Oct 2013, at Camp Atterbury, IN and will explore emerging technology solutions and revolutionary improvements in technology for Survivability and performance improvement / Unconventional Warfare (UW). Any technology-based experiment conducted at the event will need to be capable of supporting a SOF unit to provide a revolutionary improvement in SOF operations. Any and all solutions must include all necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. Survivability and performance improvement /UW technology areas may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>For Survivability and Performance Improvements specifically,<br />&bull; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)<br />&bull; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).<br />&bull; Human Performance Optimization of SOF: Maximizing physical, mental, cognitive performance of SOF including improving sleep function / mental acuity) Protection Solutions, including armor for ballistic protection, and blast protection <br />&bull; Exoskeletons - improving load carriage for SOF operators<br />&bull; Injury Prevention, Rehabilitative Technologies -Pre-habilitation and Rehabilitation for SOF Physiological Status Monitoring (real time) for SOF ops</p>
<p>Proposed solutions should take the operator into consideration, mentally and/or physically.</p>
<p>For Unconventional Warfare specifically,<br />&bull; Precision target tracking and Locating (TTL)<br />&bull; Counter surveillance/collection detection/avoidance <br />&bull; Specialized entry techniques, alarm system detection and bypass <br />&bull; Cultural and language methods and technologies <br />&bull; Emotional, cognitive and stress profiles</p>
<p>This technical experimentation event is making accommodations for technology developers to submit nominations focusing on the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) enhanced mobility/protective technologies which may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<SOLNBR>M6740009D0001
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:minako.chinen.ja@usmc.mil">Minako Chinen, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Regional Contracting Officeâ€”Far East, US Marine Corps Installations Pacific intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Sole-Source Commercial Purchase Request to Senon Limited for the Camp Fuji Bus Driver/Shuttle Services. 

The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 United States Code (USC) 2304 (c) (1) OR 41 U.S.C.253 (c) (1). This authority is supported by an approved Sole Source letter. It is the Government's intent to proceed with this sole-source action. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 485320. 

Unique Qualifications/Rational for Use of the Authority Cited:

Although FAR Clause 52.217-8 was included in the contract, the value of the option was not included in the price evaluation conducted prior to contract award.
 In a GAO ruling dated 14 September 2009, if the value of the option was not included in the price evaluation, a J&A is required before the option can be exercised. 
Exercising the option clause stated above will provide continued contractual coverage of the vehicle operation/shuttle services supporting for Combined Armed Training Center (CATC) Camp Fuji. The required services are deemed to be available only from Senon Limited because it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Combined Armed Training Center (CATC) Camp Fuji requirements. The purpose of this extension is to maintain continuity by obtaining vehicle operation/shuttle services from the incumbent provider for the minimum period of time necessary to solicit and award a new contract.
 It is highly unlikely that there will be competition for this requirement since the period of performance is only for two months. The follow-on requirement will be solicited on NECO using full and open competition procedures.

This notice neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does it restrict the Government in any way to an ultimate acquisition approach. The Government is requesting that interested concerns feeling they can fully support this requirement, furnish the following information:

-Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address.

Any interested parties believing they can meet all the requirements listed above, may submit a response.
 All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government technical representative to evaluate and determine if it can meet the requirement. The requested information is due no later than 2:00PM (Local Time/Japan Time) on 10 Jul 2013 and can be provided to Regional Contracting Officeâ€”Far East, Attn: Minako Chinen (Contract Specialist), PSC 557 Box 2000 FPO AP 96379-2000 or via e-mail to: minako.chinen.ja@usmc.mil. 

This notice is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this synopsis.

Notice of Intent

The Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Palm Beach, FL intends is to award a blood products contract/purchase order per VAAR Part 806.302(a)(2) and US Code 38USC8153 and 7302.  This award is for the delivery of blood and various blood components, but is used secondary to receipt of other Federal Agency supplies of blood and blood components.  The period of performance is for 6 months and an estimated value of $300,000.  The awardee is to be One Blood Inc., 10100 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St. N., Saint Petersburg, FL  33716.

Due to the continuing need of blood and various blood components by our veterans, this intention of award will provide time for preparation of a solicitation and award for a Base and Four year contract; more importantly it will prevent a discontinuance of blood supply in the interim. 

At the end of this 6 month period it is most probable that a competed contract will be solicited although not required due to the statute noted above.

Please contact the undersigned for any questions or concerns regarding the award.

<DESC>Western Federal Lands Highway Division Facility<br />Exterior Lighting Improvements
<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This synopsis/solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ), No. DTFH70-13-Q-00012, being issued by the Federal Highway Administration Simplified Acquisitions Department with the intent to procure New LED lighting fixture upgrades, firm-fixed price contract. Price to include delivery and installation (FOB Destination), to: Federal Highway Administration, Western Federal Lands Highway Division, 610 East Fifth Street, Vancouver, WA 98661.</p>
<p>This Solicitation, is prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, the acquisition of commercial items in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award as prescribed in FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Total Small Business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238210 with an industry 14.0 Million. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms with the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>See Clause 52.212-2 below, for evaluation criteria. It is the contractor responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. FAR Provisions and Clauses may be viewed and/or downloaded from http://www.arnet.gov/far/. All firms responding must be registered with the **System for Award Management (SAM, website: http://www.sam.gov/), formally known as CCR, prior to receiving an award. Once this combined synopsis/solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.</p>
<p><br />History</p>
<p>ISC Physical Security Criteria for Federal Facilities identifies that exterior lighting be installed at entrances, exits, parking lots, and garages and that Lighting should be sufficient to illuminate potential areas of concealment, enhance the observation of guard patrols, and provide for the safety of personnel moving between adjacent parking areas, streets, alleyways, and around the facility. Site lighting should be coordinated with the closed-circuit television (CCTV) system. A recent audit identifies that exterior lighting at the Western Federal Lands Highway (WFLHD) facility located at 610 E. Fifth St Vancouver, WA 98661 does not satisfy ISC lighting criteria.</p>
<p>Exterior lighting at WFLHD is currently provided by traditional high wattage light sources. Adding additional high wattage light sources would increase light levels and increase electrical power use by the WFLHD facility. Federal agencies are required to decrease the amount of electrical power used by Government facilities. This statement of work describes that low wattage LED lighting satisfying both security and energy use requirements be installed at the WFLHD facility.</p>

(Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.) (i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled ?Trade Agreements.? (ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification.

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR PART 13.106 for the requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation number is 1119148 and this solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />RESPONSE DATE: 07/08/2013
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66 effective April 1, 2013.<br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990- All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Analysis; FSC Code is B504. Small Business Size Standard is $14.0 Million. Acquisition is unrestricted.<br />Contract Type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. <br />REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Part I: General Information</p>
<p>Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Division of Systems Biology, Innovative Safety and Technologies Branch requires collaboration on multi-disciplinary research efforts in nationally recognized research programs in support of FDA's mission.</p>
<p>Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and cigarette smoking is the leading risk factor for the development of bladder cancer. Recent epidemiological studies have strengthened the association of cigarette smoking with bladder cancer.</p>
<p>Objective: The FDA's hypothesis is that microRNA (miRNA) may be a reliable biomarker to identify patients with bladder cancer and potentially distinguish between bladder cancer that occurs in smokers vs. NEVER smokers. Since some miRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, they may also be more specific than existing biomarkers of bladder cancer. It is hypothesized that miRNA expression patterns found in blood and/or urine could mirror the miRNA changes in bladder tumors and be potentially used as noninvasive biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>Part II: Work Requirements<br /><br />Scope: The main research aspect is to determine if biofluids miRNA can serve as early molecular biomarkers for tobacco smoking-induced bladder cancer. The researcher shall hold a Ph.D. degree in Physiology and Biophysics or Oncology. Contractor activities shall include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Isolation of RNA from human tissues, analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing data, use of bioinformatics tools to elucidate the mechanisms and confirm miRNA biomarkers using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). <br />&bull; Development of circulating miRNA biomarkers for smoking-related bladder cancer, analysis of miRNA profiling in body fluid by qRT-PCR array.</p>
<p>Deliverables and Milestones: The following are deliverables/milestones for the base period:</p>
<p>1. RNA extraction: Extraction of serum, urine and tissue samples for miRNA profiling analysis. An estimated total of one-hundred and twenty (120) RNA samples, including miRNA fraction, shall be isolated by Trizol method. The quality and quantity of the RNA shall be assessed by Nanodrop with data results submitted to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) electronically in spreadsheet format. Due Date: Within 30 business days from start of the period of performance. <br />2. microRNA profiling: An estimated sixty (60) tissue RNA samples shall be provided to external vendors for Next-Generation sequencing analyze. An estimated sixty (60) urinary microRNA samples shall be analyzed using qRT-PCR array. The microRNA expression data shall be submitted to the COR electronically in spreadsheet format to include threshold cycles (Ct) values. Due Date: Within 60 business days from date of milestone 1 completion. <br />3. Processing and storage of miRNA-seq results. The estimated sixty (60) sample Next-Generation sequencing data shall be uploaded to ArrayTrack. Upon completion, the COR shall be notified in order to verify the data input into ArrayTrack. Due Date: Within 60 business days from date of milestone 2 completion.<br />4. Analysis of miRNA-seq results. Once the data is uploaded to ArrayTrack, comparisons between the cancer, an estimated thirty (30) samples, and control, an estimated thirty (30) samples shall be made to identify miRNA changes that associated with bladder cancer. Contractor shall provide a complete list, electronically to the COR, of all miRNA checked for changes. Due Date: Within 90 business days from date of milestone 3 completion.<br />5. Confirmation of miRNA biomarkers. Once the list of biomarkers has been identified from Next-Generation sequencing and/or qRT-PCR array, secondary confirmation of the results shall be conducted. Specifically, qRT-PCR single reaction confirmation of the biomarker changes shall be conducted for existing samples. miRNA targets and the related biological pathway shall be predicted using different computational algorithms. A final results report shall be submitted to the COR. Due Date: Within 120 business days from date of milestone 4 completion.</p>
<p>The contractor shall use the same technical approach as the base period to provide similar deliverables/milestones in the option period. The sample type may change, i.e. to human lung RNA.</p>

<DESC>This solicitation is a sole source acquisition notice for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for Telemetry Data Processors (TDPs).  This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Quotation to GDP Space Systems, Horsham, PA, for the following: Line Item 1: Single Module Rack Mount Chassis - Part Number: MD2350-01 - Quantity: 17 Line Item 2: Frame Synchronizer AE Format - Part Number: OP2350-30 - Quantity: 17 Line Item 3: Dual PCM Input/ Output Module - Part Number: OP2350-40 - Quantity: 17 The required TDPs are already being utilized by LSP at both coasts and must be acquired by the sole manufacturer/distributor, GDP Space Systems to maintain compatibility with both existing equipment and operations at both coasts. Significant amounts of custom software have been developed and tested by both GDP Space Systems and LSP telemetry engineers to work with this particular TDP. Deviating would result in prohibitive costs and time for re-development, re-testing, and re-training of operations personnel. Furthermore, deviating would reduce LSP telemetry's capabilities to maintain common, low-quantity set of equipment as spares on both coasts (the ability to quickly ship equipment between the coasts in cases of equipment failure is crucial in our operations strategy). Delivery of the Telemetry Data Processors is due no later than September 30, 2013. Quotation must reflect that the delivery date can be met. Evaluation criteria are technical acceptability and overall lowest cost.  It is critical that offerors provide adequate product and delivery detail to allow evaluation of the offer.  (SEE FAR 52.212-1(b)). Offers for the items(s) described above are due by June 28, 2013, 4:30 PM (EST) via email to maile.t.krienke@nasa.gov. Interested organizations may submit their written quotation or written detailed capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 PM EST on June 28, 2013. Such detailed capabilities and qualifications must demonstrate in writing the ability to meet this requirement and will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Questions must be received in writing (email) by 4:30 PM EST on June 26, 2013, to the identified point of contact. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-66B. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334290, 750 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

As used in this clause-- <br>  <br> Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority. <br>  <br> Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. <br>  <br> (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall  represent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: <br>  <br> (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br>  <br> (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br>  <br> (3) For long-term contracts-- <br>  <br> (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and <br>  <br> (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. <br>  <br> (c) The Contractor shall re-represent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards. <br>  <br> (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. <br>  <br> (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. <br>  <br> (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. <br>  <br> (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: <br>  <br> The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code      - assigned to contract number      . <br>  <br> (Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title). <br>  <br> (End of clause) <br>  <br>  <br> 52.222-17  Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers. (JAN 2013) <br>  <br> (a) Service employee, as used in this clause, means any person engaged in the performance of a service contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in 29 CFR part 541. The term ``service employee'' includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or subcontractor and such persons. <br>  <br> (b) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those service employees employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the service employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which the service employees are qualified. <br>  <br> (1) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of service employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor Contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. <br>  <br> (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the Contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. <br>  <br> (i) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall make a bona fide express offer of employment to each service employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the service employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the service employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days. <br>  <br> (ii) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall decide any question concerning a service employee's qualifications based upon the individual's education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee's experience on the predecessor contract, and the Contractor may utilize employment screening  <br> processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with Executive Order 13495. <br>  <br> (iii) Where the successor Contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractor's first date of performance on the contract. <br>  <br> (iv) An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. (See 29 CFR 9.12 for a detailed description of a bonafide offer of employment). <br>  <br> (c)(1) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (b) of this clause, the successor Contractor and any subcontractors (i) may employ under this contract any service employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who  <br> would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (ii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701(3), and (iii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service  <br> employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the Contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job (see 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for additional information). The successor Contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the  <br> appropriateness of claiming any of these exceptions. <br>  <br> (2) In addition, any Contractor or subcontractor that has been certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration as a HUBZone small business concern must ensure that it complies with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the HUBZone Program (e.g., it must ensure that at least 35 percent of all of its employees reside within a HUBZone). The HUBZone small business Contractor or subcontractor must consider whether it can meet the requirements of this clause and Executive Order 13495 while also ensuring it meets the HUBZone Program's  <br> requirements. <br>  <br> (3) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to permit a Contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law. For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see FAR subpart 19.13), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veterans'  <br> Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may conflict, in certain circumstances, with the requirements of Executive Order 13495. All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495, 29 CFR part 9, and this clause. <br>  <br> (d)(1) The Contractor shall, not less than 30 days before completion of the Contractor's performance of services on the contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. Where changes to the workforce are made after the  <br> submission of the certified list described in this paragraph, the Contractor shall, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause, not less than 10 days before completion of the services on this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with an updated certified list of the names of all service employees employed within the last month of contract performance. The updated list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment, and, where applicable, dates of  <br> separation of each service employee under the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. <br>  <br> (2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives. <br>  <br> (3) The Contracting Officer will direct the predecessor Contractor to provide written notice (Appendix B to 29 CFR chapter 9) to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. Where a significant portion of the predecessor Contractor's workforce is not fluent in English, the notice shall be provided in English and the language(s) with which service employees are more familiar. The written notice  <br> shall be- <br>  <br> (i) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or    (ii) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such  <br> delivery is via email, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. <br>  <br> (e)(1) If required in accordance with 52.222-41(n), the predecessor Contractor shall, not less than 10 days before  <br> completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. If there are no changes to the  <br> workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor Contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor Contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than 10 days prior to performance completion. <br>  <br> (2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives. <br>  <br> (f) The Contractor and subcontractor shall maintain the following records (regardless of format, e.g., paper or electronic) of its compliance with this clause for not less than a period of three years from the date the records were created. <br>  <br> (1) Copies of any written offers of employment or a contemporaneous written record of any oral offers of employment, including the date, location, and attendance roster of any service employee meeting(s) at which the offers were extended, a summary of each meeting, a copy of any written notice that may have been  <br> distributed, and the names of the service employees from the predecessor contract to whom an offer was made. <br>  <br> (2) A copy of any record that forms the basis for any exemption claimed under this part. <br>  <br> (3) A copy of the service employee list provided to or received from the contracting agency. <br>  <br> (4) An entry on the pay records of the amount of any retroactive payment of wages or compensation under the supervision of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to each service employee, the period covered by such payment, and the date of payment, and a copy of any receipt form provided by or authorized by  <br> the Wage and Hour Division. The Contractor shall also deliver a copy of the receipt to the service employee and file the original, as evidence of payment by the Contractor and receipt by the service employee, with the Administrator or an authorized representative within 10 days after payment is made. <br>  <br> (g) Disputes concerning the requirements of this clause shall not be subject to the general disputes clause (52.233-1) of this contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 9. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between or among any of the following: The Contractor, the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the service employees  <br> under the contract or its predecessor contract. The Contracting Officer will refer any service employee who wishes to file a complaint, or ask questions concerning this contract clause, to the: Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,  <br> DC 20210. Contact email: displaced@dol.gov. <br>  <br> (h) The Contractor shall cooperate in any review or investigation by the Department of Labor into possible violations of the provisions of this clause and shall make such records requested by such official(s) available for inspection, copying, or transcription upon request. <br>  <br> (i) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the Contractor or its  <br> subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the Contractor  <br> or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order 13495, the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law. <br>  <br> (j) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance. However, if the Contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the Contractor may request that the United States, through the  <br> Secretary, enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States. <br>  <br> (k) The Contracting Officer will withhold, or cause to be withheld, from the prime Contractor under this or any other  <br> Government contract with the same prime Contractor, such sums as an authorized official of the Department of Labor requests, upon a determination by the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, that there has been a failure to comply with the terms of this clause and that wages lost as a result  <br> of the violations are due to service employees or that other monetary relief is appropriate. If the Contracting Officer or the Administrator, upon final order of the Secretary, finds that the Contractor has failed to provide a list of the names of service employees working under the contract, the Contracting Officer may, in his or her discretion, or upon request by the Administrator, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of the  <br> payment of contract funds until such time as the list is provided to the Contracting Officer. <br>  <br> (l) Subcontracts. In every subcontract over the simplified acquisition threshold entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the Contractor shall include a provision that  <br> ensures- <br>  <br> (1) That each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (c) of this clause with respect to the service employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor Contractor and its subcontractors; <br>  <br> (2) That the subcontractor will provide the Contractor with the information about the service employees of the subcontractor needed by the Contractor to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause; and <br>  <br> (3) The recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (f) of this clause. <br>  <br>  <br> (End of clause)   <br>  <br>  <br> 52.252-2      CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)  <br>  <br> This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k) (1) or (k) (2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c) (1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c) (2) (ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d) (1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

(For Camp Pendleton, this process currently includes the requirement that employees under a contract of one year or longer obtain a Business Pass, which requires completion of an application used to conduct background checks.)  

The Commanding Officer of each base has broad authority to remove or exclude any person from the military installation to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.
  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding Officer may refuse to grant personal entry passes or may bar Contractor employees, including employees who have been granted a personal entry pass.  Refusal to grant an employee a personal entry pass or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.

The Contractorâ€™s employees shall observe and comply with all base rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. 

Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms with nametags.
   The contracting officer may approve alternate methods of ensuring contractor personnel are readily identifiable.

Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks.  Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by Military Police or other security or safety personnel.

The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), Public Law 99-603 (8 U.S.C. 1324a) requires employers verify the eligibility of individuals for employment to preclude the unlawful hiring, or recruiting or referring for a fee, of aliens who are not authorized to work in the United States.  By signing this proposal/contract or by beginning work under this contract, the Offeror/Contractor certifies it has and will comply with IRCA, to include that it has verified the identity and employment eligibility of any individual employed who is or may be employed by the offeror and works under this contract.
  


Application for Vendor/Contractor Business Passes:  The procedures below are the requirements for Camp Pendleton.  Other installations will have similar requirements for obtaining business passes.
1.	The Contractor will obtain a letter of support from the customer that their contract ultimately supports.  The letter of support will identify the Company Name, Contract Number, period of performance of the Contract, location of performance, the Drivers license and expiration date of each of the Contractorâ€™s employees, and the point of contact information for the customer that signed the request.  The Contractorâ€™s personnel will take the letter of support to request either a business pass or RapidGate access to Support Services Police Administrative Services Branch (Bldg.
 1523) for processing.   
2.	Business Passes issued by Support Services Divisionâ€™s Police Admin Services Branch to vendors or contractors are effective from the date of issuance, for a period of 60 days or the end of the contract whichever date occurs first.   Personnel denied a business pass might appeal in writing to the Commanding Officer, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton (Attn: CMD Inspector).  Denial or revocation of a business pass may be made if the applicant:
i.	Is listed on the National Terrorist Watch List.
ii.	Is not a U.S. Citizen and is illegally present in the U.S. or whose U.S. citizenship, immigration status, or Social Security Number (SSN) cannot be verified.
iii.	Is subject to an outstanding criminal warrant.
iv.	Whose business pass application contains false or fraudulent information.
v.	Has obtained a felony conviction within the last 10 years.
 
vi.	Has obtained a total of three criminal misdemeanor convictions within the last 10 years.
vii.	Who is a registered sex offender regardless of the date of the criminal offense. 
viii.	Has obtained a criminal misdemeanor or felony conviction for the following types of criminal offenses:
1.	Offenses of a sexual nature;
2.	Offenses of violence;
3.	Offenses related to gang related activity, supremacist, or extremist behavior; i.e., hate crimes;
4.	Crimes resulting from the possession, use, manufacturer, introduction, or distribution of any illegal drug listed in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention & Control Act of 1970, Schedules I through IV;
ix.	Offenses in which weapon instrumentality (e.g., firearm, knife, or other bladed instrument, club, brass knuckles) was used either as a means of violence, or threat of violence
x.	Whose military active duty was terminated by the receipt of a dishonorable discharge or bad conduct discharge.
xi.	Has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from any military installation.
xii.	Who has exhibited characteristics, traits, or other indications that cause concern for the safety or welfare of personnel and/or residents aboard the base; or that causes concern for the physical security of the base.

3.	Camp Pendleton has implemented a Contractor-managed security service, RAPIDGate â„¢.
   RAPIDGate is consistent with and complementary to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and the Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201).
Participation in RAPIDGate is optional, but contractor personnel who are not enrolled in	RAPIDGate will be limited to gates which can safely accommodate traffic backups. Those gates are San Luis Rey, Las Pulgas, and San Onofre.  All gates will be open to RAPIDGate registered Contractor personnel.  
Under the RAPIDGate program, Contractor personnel are vetted through a series of national and local record checks to determine whether they meet Camp Pendletonâ€™s criteria for access.  The determination of whether to authorize a pass (badge) is made by the Government.
  The badges have Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) capability, and will be scanned upon entry onto the installation.  Contractor personnel departure from the installation will be recorded by passive RFID receivers.  Contactor personnel who have been screened and are determined to be eligible for access will be required to self register at kiosks located at the Main Gate, San Onofre Gate,  as well as two additional kiosks located in Bldg. 1523 (PMO).
The cost of the RAPIDGate program is $99.00 per year for the Contractorâ€™s firm, and $129.00 per Contractor employee for a one-year pass.  The fee for lost or stolen passes is $30.00. 
Contractors who choose not to participate in the RAPIDGate program will be required to obtain a 30-day business pass from PMO.
  These personnel will be required to access Camp Pendleton at the following gates:  San Luis Rey, Las Pulgas and San Onofre.
Contractor personnel who are issued a Common Access Card (CAC) as a requirement for their positions (specifically access to the Navy Marine Corps Intranet), do not need to participate in RapidGate.

4.	Application for Common Access Card (CAC):  For personnel that require access to any government computers, the following procedures are required:

a.  The Contractor will be required to provide proof that a National Agency Check (NAC) or National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) has been submitted to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for each employee that has a requirement for a CAC Card.
   During the period between the time that the request is submitted and the time that the investigation is returned, the Government may grant temporary access to the Contractorâ€™s employee.  Whether to grant temporary access is within the sole discretion of the Government, and a decision not to grant access shall not be grounds for a request for an equitable adjustment or other contract modification, and shall not constitute an excuse for Contractor failure to perform.  Such temporary access will not exceed 90 days. 

b.  Upon the return of the Investigation Schedule Notice and Certificate of Investigation from OPM, the Contractor shall provide a copy to the security manager that has overall responsibility for the customer supported by the Contractorâ€™s employees.

c.
  "Report of Agency Adjudication Action" (form 79A) is sent when there are potential actionable issue (s) at the minor, moderate, or substantial level which may be disqualifying under suitability/security considerations. If the contractor receives an Agency Adjudication Action from OPM, the security manager shall be consulted before such adjudicative action is determined and returned to OPM.  

d.  The Government will use the Adjudicative Guidelines (CNO ltr 5520 Ser 09N2/6U871220 of Sept 06) to guide determinations on whether access shall be granted.  

e.  The Contractor shall be notified in writing if there is a disqualifying event that prevents the Contractorâ€™s employee from obtaining a CAC.
  If temporary access was granted it shall be immediately revoked.   

f.  The information required to initiate a background investigation through OPM, as well as a listing of the forms that are required, is contained at the following website:  http://www.opm.gov/extra/investigate/IS-15.pdf


Base access requirements and procedures may change during the term of a contract.  The contractor shall comply with all changes, and such compliance shall not be grounds for a request for an equitable adjustment or other contract modification.


ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
(a)	Photography is restricted on the Base.  Clearance for photography will be obtained from appropriate Base personnel.  When requested by the Base, all films must be turned over to the appropriate personnel for processing and security inspection.
(b)	All contractor personnel are to be familiar with the Camp Pendleton Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS).
  Personnel are required to observe all restrictions applicable under the FDRS pertaining to permit activities while on the Base.  In particular, vehicles shall be parked only on bar soli/rock.  Smoking is restricted to areas of bare soil.  Fires of any nature are prohibited.
(c)	Do not pickup, remove, or disturb any ordnance (spent or live ammunition, brass, pyrotechnics, etc) found while on Camp Pendleton.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.     <br>          <br>     	HQ Army Materiel Command	     <br>     	Office of Command Counsel     <br>     	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401     <br>     	Ft.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Warren Seymour, at warren.g.seymour.mil@mail.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527.

If internet access is not available, contact the HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum, respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not acceptable responses.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

Duns & Bradstreet, CAGE Code & Federal Tax ID numbers MUST be submitted with offer. If you need any additional assistance getting registered, please send me an email and I will send you additional instructions.   <br>      <br>   All questions, quote submission form, sample menus and hotel information in response to this notice must be submitted by email to adrienne.c.rochat.ctr@mail.mil .  The contract will be awarded to lowest priced technically acceptable.  A site visit to the hotel may be required prior to award.  The deadline for quotes is July 3rd, 2013 by 8AM MST.    <br>      <br>  Questions and Answers.   <br>  All questions must be submitted by email to adrienne.c.rochat.ctr@mail.mil by July 1st, 2013 by 8:00 AM MST in order to ensure a response.   <br>    <br>  Question#1: Wanted to ask if the rooms will be double, single or family occupancy.  <br>  This will help us understand if we are dealing with a rate that will fall under one per diem lodging rate or multiple per diem lodging rates.  <br>    <br>  Answer#1: It is stated in the Statement of Work that the rooms will be either single or double occupancy.  The per diem is a flat rate and doesn't change no matter how many people are staying in the room.  Each per diem rate is based on location and it gives out the maximum cost per room.  The rates quoted must be at or below the per diem rate without any addition fees.   To figure out the per diem rates go to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120  for lodging and meal allowances.   <br>   To find the meals breakdown for each meal go to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/101518.   <br>   <br> The original solicitation form failed to upload.  I have attached the solicitation which includes the Statement of Work which will answer most of the questions. <br>  <br> Question#2:   How many complimentary wireless connections do you need? <br>  <br> Answer#2: We need approximately 10 wireless connections <br>  <br> Question#3:  What is the intent for the space? As well as square foot requirements? Also are there going to be displays, vendors, or any requirements for tables etc in the spaces <br>  <br> Answer#3: All of these questions can be answered in the Statement of Work.  Please see attached solicitation Statement of work on pages 17-20. <br>  <br> Question#4:  With room requirement at 29, can we assume based on space needs many people will be attending but not staying at the hotel? The only reason I ask is we are asking for a lot of meeting space room for only 29 rooms, so if we can get a total number of attendees so we can coordinate proper space requirements <br>  <br> Answer#4: Most of the individuals are local residents and are not authorized lodging.  We are expecting approximately 300 adults and 115 children/youth at this event.  The space requirements, type of seating arrangements and square footage is all in the Statement of Work. Please see attached solicitation Statement of work on pages 17-20. <br>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

<p>Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems Directorate Program Control Office LCMP Software Development and Support</p>
<p>20 Jun 13</p>
<p>Technical Questionnaire - 2</p>
<p>LCMP was developed cooperatively between the KC-135 Program Office and the Original Software Developer (OSD). The software design, documentation, training, test/development environments, C&amp;A environments, staging, and module leveraging process are currently OSD-proprietary. New requirements for LCMP development are mutually funded by the requesting weapon system and the OSD; upon deployment, the modules/enhancements retain partial OSD ownership.</p>
<p>Please provide concise answers directly addressing each element of the questions below, limit your total response to 10 pages. For each question, please indicate if you currently possess the capability; if the task is not within your current capability, please indicate how you would establish the capability and how much time it would take to become fully effective.</p>
<p>1. Do you have processes and standards needed to design and develop new features while sustaining the LCMP system?</p>
<p>2. How would you continue LCMP development (modules, enhancements) and sustainment (training, PM questions, software bugs) while acquiring or developing proprietary portions?</p>
<p>3. Do you understand LCMP's two-tier architecture; the intentions of its design, capabilities, and constraints that must be considered when providing software engineering support?</p>
<p>4. How would you continue the design and development of modules and enhancements currently being developed by the OSD? Would they remain on-schedule?</p>
<p>5. How would you gain rights to use software modules/enhancements developed by the OSD?</p>
<p>6. Do you have the capability to provide substantial schedule and cost reduction/cost avoidance through leveraging other OSD-created LCMP capabilities?</p>
<p>7. How would you ensure uninterrupted support at low risk to the Government while providing cost efficient leveraging of existing features from other OSD-created Government LCMP applications?</p>
<p>8. How would you coordinate with the OSD and 10 other weapon systems utilizing LCMP-IDE to ensure the ICBMSD is aligned with the established leveraging process and continue to provide support in identifying opportunities to obtain cross leveraging/shared costs of new development with other using organizations?</p>
<p>9. Do you possess expertise in LCMP security architecture and the defined process for updating policies to comply with evolving security requirements?</p>
<p>10. How would you collaborate with the OSD to identify possible leveraging opportunities early in the development process and inject ICBMSD requirements for an easier-to-leverage product with a shorter timeline?</p>

<p><br />General Information</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: W911QY-13-R-0007 SUAS Services<br />Document type: Pre-solicitation notice / SYNOPSIS<br />Posted date: 23 October 2012<br />NAICS code(s): 611512 - Flight Training with Small Business Administration size standard of $25.5M<br />Small Business Set aside: Small Business</p>
<p>The Natick Contracting Division (NCD) located at 13501 Ingenuity Drive, Suite 200, Orlando, FL 32826 hereby issues the following synopsis W911QY-13-R-0007 as a Small Business Set-aside for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Training, Logistics Support, and Technical / Program Management, unclassified items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 5.1, 15.201 and 19.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.</p>
<p>The solicitation document will incorporate provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61. The associated NAICS code is 611512 Flight Training and the Small Business size standard is $25.5 M. Proposals shall be good for 180 calendar days after close of proposal period. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is applicable, with an assigned rating of DO-A1. A Sources Sought Notice was published in the FedBizOpps on 1 March 2012, where more than two small businesses responded that were judged to be able to meet the requirements. Based on this and other Market Research, a determination was made to set the effort aside 100% for Small Business. Therefore, only qualified Small Business offerors may submit their Proposals for the anticipated Solicitation.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for Training, Logistics Support, and Technical / Program Management for a full spectrum of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) and Parts required to support the SUAS Product Office (PdO) in CONUS and OCONUS, and its domestic and foreign customers. The Army has a requirement to sustain/maintain the 1798 RQ-11B and 325 RQ-20A systems currently fielded, and alternative medium and long range systems procured in the future.</p>
<p>The objective of the SUAS Support Program is to support the Warfighters as well as other Governmental<br />Agencies (OGAs) and Non-Governmental Agencies users' SUAS-related sustainment needs. These needs<br />primarily include SUAS training, maintenance, repairs, and engineering services. Additionally, the SUAS PdO will require various non-SETA logistics, technical management, and program management services to support its SUAS customers. The approximate percentage of effort in each area of focus is: Flight Training - 60%, Contractor Logistics - 35%, Technical/Program Management - 5%.</p>
<p>Complete individual instructor flight packets shall be submitted as part of the offeror's proposal for evaluation by the PM UAS GFR. Instructor flight packets will include the following four items: two DD forms 1821 (one each for RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma, IAW Attachment 4, AR 95-20); Crewmember resume; two DD Forms 2627 (one each for RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma, IAW Attachment 3, AR 95-20); FAA Medical Certification (Class 3 or higher). Note: Offerors shall provide with their proposal no less than fourteen (14) Individual Instructor Flight Packets for proposed GFR Certified instructors. The resume portion of the packet shall indicate if the person is a current employee or a contingency hire upon award.</p>
<p>SUAS Trainers shall be certified on all SUAS products available from the Army inventory (currently RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma). While the below table is not a training schedule, it provides the minimum workforce required in the post-award period. The offerors shall be able to show its ability to reach these workforce levels. For example, 14 GFR-certified Puma trainers will be required for various training missions in MAY 2013 (6 in OEF, 8 in CONUS). In JUNE 2013, the required Puma trainers will increase from 14 to18, and 10 Raven trainers will also be required. This escalation continues until 22 Puma trainers, and 22 Raven trainers are available to conduct the anticipated maximum training density (total of 44 interchangeable trainers). <br />Note: actual training schedules will be published as a formal requirement in subsequent Task Orders, post-IDIQ award. The below table is not to be interpreted as a schedule, and as such it is not guaranteed that the maximum training density will be required in August or September, etc.</p>
<p>Training Workforce Needed (Time Phased Escalation)<br /><br />MAY (begins on 29 APR)<br />14 Puma<br />0&nbsp; Raven<br />14 Total<br /><br />JUNE<br />18 Puma<br />10 Raven<br />28 Total<br />&nbsp;<br />JULY<br />22 Puma<br />14 Raven<br />36 Total<br />&nbsp;<br />AUGUST <br />22 Puma<br />22 Raven<br />44 Total<br /><br />SEPTEMBER&nbsp;<br />22 Puma<br />22 Raven<br />44 Total<br /><br />Etc...&nbsp;<br /><br />*Note: Trainers will be interchangeable, and must be certified on both Raven and Puma</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

THIS IS A PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE - This Notice is Not a Solicitation. The Orlando VA Medical Center (OVAMC) is issuing this pre-solicitation notice in accordance with FAR 5.102. The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the Orlando VA Medical Center (OVAMC) are engaged in critical organization-wide initiatives to fulfill public service missions while reducing costs to US taxpayers. This challenge is compounded by public sector healthcare organizations which face both the regulatory and accountability challenges of government agencies and also the expectations and innovation forces of private sector medicine. The Orlando VA Medical Center has aggressively engaged this mandate by authorizing a series of strategic priorities to better serve Veteran patients while ensuring organizational capabilities of all employees. The OVAMC staff is now faced with the challenge to act with transformative results - to transform what will be one of the region's largest integrated healthcare systems into the very best - being number one in quality, satisfaction, staff engagement and efficiency.
The requested work focuses on quality healthcare delivery. OVAMC is seeking to develop and implement a Hospital Simulation and Training Program that will enable the identification, development, dissemination and implementation of processes to support OVAMC's delivery of quality patient care.
This project addresses the Leadership's priority to provide Veterans with convenient access to information about the VA health benefits, their medical records, health information, expert advice, and the ongoing support needed to make informed health decisions and successfully implement their health plans. Given the growing needs of US veterans living in Central Florida, a new Orlando VA Medical Center under construction at Lake Nona is scheduled to open its doors in 2013-14. This new facility will include a 134 bed hospital, a 120 bed community living center, a 69 bed domiciliary, an outpatient clinic, and a veteran's benefits mini service center. The center will also be equipped with the latest in digital technology and modern technologies. The new OVAMC will increase the healthcare options for approximately 400,000 Central Florida veterans and will be part of the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 8.  It is expected that this new center in VISN 8 will be an exemplar for the VA and quality healthcare across the nation. The OVAMC will serve as a model for new centers in Denver and New Orleans. The standing up of any new organization undergoes a period of adjustment before the people, processes, systems and services are well-aligned and functioning optimally. In a medical care facility, leadership and staff do not have the luxury of a long adjustment period. Processes, systems and services must be up and running from the moment the doors are open and the first patients arrive. An optimally functioning organization accomplishes its mission, using scarce resources efficiently and by being adaptive in an ever-changing environment.  The work to be accomplished under this contract will enable achievement of the Strategic Goal to "provide veterans personalized proactive, patient driven health care."
Under the contract to be awarded, the VA requests that a program be developed that shall enable the identification, development, dissemination, and implementation of processes to support OVAMC's delivery of quality patient care. The contractor shall draw from best practices available throughout the VA and other healthcare organizations so as to move OVAMC from a start-up to a fully operational facility. In designing these processes, the contractor shall engage participants from a cross-section of the OVAMC and veteran population to ensure that the voices of all those engaged in the patient care continuum are heard. Initially, focus will be on those processes that ensure veterans have "convenient access to information about VA health benefits, their medical records, health information, expert advice and the ongoing support needed." This contract shall engage personnel from a variety of occupations and positions including Health Benefit Advisors, Program Application Specialists, Information Technologists, clinical personnel, as well as Veterans and their caregivers. The outcome of this contract shall be a fully functional medical center that uses state-of-the -art, documented procedures to deliver the highest quality of care. The program shall be designed to reflect the VA's core values (ICARE), PCC principles and VHA's six principles (patient centered care, team based work, data driven/ evidence based , prevention /population health, providing value and continuously improving).
The contractor shall include the following 4 Phases to meet the intent of the government:
"	Build an Operational Foundation
"	Develop Key Processes, Procedures and Guidelines
"	Train the Workforce / Simulate the Work Environment
"	Update/Implement.
The results of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 611430.
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.
Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.

<DESC> <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a solicitation set aside for certified small business contractors for the repair of the wharf located along the east side of the Block Island Harbor, Block Island, Rhode Island.  The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990, size standard of $33.5M.  The project is planned to be issued in April 2013 as a Small Business Lowest Bid award. The construction will begin after the summer tourist season, and extend over one-two months.  Cost will be in $100,000 to $500,000 range.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District.  <br>    <br>  The work of this project involves repairing a wharf damaged by the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy.  The wharf is located on the eastern side of the inner basin of old harbor on Block Island, Rhode Island, and is in front of Ballard's Inn.  Numerous inboard pile caps have become elevated above the tops of the inboard timber piles.  The work involves removing some of the 4 quote mark  x 10 quote mark  deck planks and timber wheel guards in order to provide access to the pile caps.  Sand and rip rap will need to be excavated or moved around each of the inboard piles in order to provide the room necessary to reseat the pile caps on top of the piles.  Once the pile caps are reseated on the inboard piles, steel straps (two per pile) will be installed at each pile, including the outboard piles.  No excavation is necessary at the outboard piles.  After the pile caps have been reseated and the straps installed, the existing timber decking and timber wheel guards shall be reinstalled using existing hardware.  In addition, the inboard fascia board shall be replaced in-kind and two ladders on the outboard face of the wharf shall be replaced.  <br>    <br>  The work of the project requires construction operations immediately adjacent to a busy public restaurant.  Barricades and chain link safety fencing shall be installed in this location to separate the general public from the active construction areas of the project.  The barricades and safety fencing shall be installed prior to the start of all other onsite activities.  The Contractor shall modify and implement other construction methods as necessary to ensure the safety of the public in this area.  <br>    <br>  Please note this solicitation is set aside for certified small businesses under the applicable NAICS code 237990, size standard of $33.5M. This is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about April 16, 2013.  Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted.  The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at cynthia.r.dmitrijev@usace.army.mil.  <br>    <br>

Description of Supplies:  This action shall be for one (1) year from the date of award. <br>  <br> The Laboratory Sciences (LS) Portfolio of the US Army Public Health Command (USAPHC) requires the purchase of an Agilent 1260 UHPLC Liquid Chromatography Single Quadruple Mass Spectrometer (LCMS) System which includes single quad MS, binary pump, autosampler, fluorescence and diode array detectors plus operating software. The LCMS System will be used for high throughput analysis of drinking water, non-potable waters, soils/solids, biological, and air related matrices for a wide variety of military-unique chemical compounds. The LS currently utilizes three (3) existing Agilent LCMS Systems.   <br> Describe the services or supplies, including make & model number, to be acquired below. <br>  <br> 4.  Authority Cited:  In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(b) & 8.405-6(1). <br>  <br> 5.  Reason for Authority Cited: FAR 8.405-6(b)  quote mark An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer. quote mark   The laboratory requires that this instrument system be manufactured by Agilent Technologies for the following reasons.  The current LC-MS equipment is manufactured by Agilent Technologies and the requested system offers similar modular components as existing LC-MS systems. Instrumentation manufactured by a different company could not be seamlessly integrated into the laboratory without additional expense and man hours.  This would include the creation of completely new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) parsers for a system other than what the lab currently utilizes.  A new system would require significant time and resources of an already strained and limited Laboratory Automation staff.  Secondly, the analytical staff is currently trained and experienced with the operation of Agilent Technologies LC-MS equipment.  The experience with the equipment represents a considerable investment in time and expense to the laboratory which has been utilized in the lab for over sixteen (16) years.  The use of a different technology would require additional expense in travel costs for training, reduction in the Turn-Around-Time (TAT) for support, as well as time to integrate a whole new system into the LIMS.  Furthermore, USAPHC has a current laboratory instrument maintenance contract with Agilent Technologies allowing consistency and efficiency in the repair and maintenance of our equipment.  It is imperative that the new machine and supporting parts be interchangeable and coordinate with the existing Government owned Agilent LCMS Systems.  In conclusion, these types of machines are very intricate and require technical expertise to operate and maintain.  If Agilent brand name is not awarded in a timely manner, the health and safety of soldiers, their families and civilians stationed domestically and in various deployed locations thoughout the world may be compromised.  LS would not be able to analyze the increased sample workload using solely the existing instrumentation on hand.  Procuring a different brand-name piece of equipment would cost the Government an estimated hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) spent in training, preparation, ingratiation, and cause unduly delays in chemical analysis directly affecting the Army's mission.  The technical experts would have to spend several hundred hours learning the new system and trying to set up the specifications to concur with the current tests produced in the laboratory.   <br>  <br> 6. Additional Information: <br>  <br> (i)	What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time? <br>  <br> If these items are not approved, the lab will be required to rely on the current equipment which has been in use for sixteen (16) years.  This current equipment has a life expectancy of twelve (12) years.  If the lab is unable to complete sample analysis due to inoperable equipment, there would be a need to subcontract the analysis to various contract labs.  This would add time to the TAT the USAPHC is currently able to provide to our clients.  It would also add additional costs to the analysis with the 1- need to ship the samples to the contract lab, 2- additional man hours to pack the samples for shipment 3- added risk of sample breakage during this extra shipping step 4- additional man hours in reviewing the analytical data upon return to the USAPHC prior to reporting to our client and 5- eliminating the USAPHC's ability to provide a rapid analytical response to emergency situations such as the world trade center or pentagon situations.  The troops in the field are relying on the laboratory to determine if their drinking water sources and surrounding areas are free of any harmful contaminants and if their camp location is also free of harmful contaminants.  By the lab's inability to perform the necessary tests in a timely manner without undue delays, the soldiers are possibly exposed to health hazards.  The laboratory's failure to provide occupational exposure data in a timely manner to hazardous materials could result in civilian and military workers lost time and legal liability to the Army for not providing a safe work environment.  Soldiers rely on USAPHC laboratories to determine if soil and water sources in which they are exposed, are free from harmful contaminates.  By the lab's inability to perform these necessary tests in-house in a timely manner, the war fighters are unaware if a possibly exposure has occurred creating short and or long term health related issues in the future. In summary, the analytical mission of the laboratory requires that the requested LC-MS System be manufactured by Agilent Technologies. <br>  <br> (ii)  What harm will come to the Government if desired contractor doesn't receive the award? <br>  <br> There would be additional costs in purchasing supporting equipment from a different type of vendor.  LS owns numerous supporting Agilent equipment, which can easily be utilized as necessary.  There would also be the high cost of training personnel in the operation and maintenance of any non-Agilent LC-MS system.  See section 6.i above for further information on this area. <br>  <br>  <br> 7.  Actions to Increase Competition: (State what actions will be taken to increase competition before subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services is required.) <br> 	Market research is a constant action being conducted within the agency.  LS continuously researching to find other companies that can provide a machine which is more efficient and obtains a more effective way of conducting chemical analysis.  If a higher technically advanced machine is introduced into the market which can provide clear chemical analysis results in a quicker and easier method, than the agency would have to consider if it is in the best interest of the Government to re-purchase all new machines and supporting equipment.  This would ultimately depend on how much the new machine(s) could impact the Army's overall mission is a positive manner and if the positive outcome to the Army outweighed the costs.  Until a more efficient and effective model is introduced into the market, this action will be competed as brand-name only of Agilent Technologies.  Agilent Technologies (large business) is the sole manufacture of this type of machine however they have several distributors of their products.   <br>  <br> 8.  Market Research:  (Describe the extent of the market research conducted to identify all qualified sources and the results thereof.   quote mark Market Research quote mark  is defined as those attempts made to ascertain whether other qualified sources exist.  Research of the market place may consist of written, telephonic, or world wide web inquiries.) <br> The agency has been conducting market research of these types of machines for approximately ten (10) years.  Some market research is conducted through the World Wide Web (WWW) as where other market reseach has consisted of hands-on experience with Agilent Technologies chromatrography equipment and other vendors of chromatography equipment.   <br>  <br> 9.  Procurement History: <br>  <br> Previous Contract or Purchase Order Number: Yes, W91ZLK-12-F-0071 <br> Previously competed?	0  N/A	0  No		1  Yes <br> Previous authority for other than Full & Open Competition: FAR 8.405-6(b) <br>  <br> 10.  Technical / Requirements Certification:  I certify that the support data under my cognizance which is included in this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br> Submitted By: Kevin L. Cofield	 <br> Position Title: Section Chief, Specialty Chemistry	 <br> Email address: kevin.cofield@us.army.mil <br> Phone: 410-436-8352	 <br>  <br> Date: 30 November 2012	 <br>  <br> 11.  Fair and Reasonable Determination: <br>  <br> I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable.  This determination is based on a comparison of other similar products in current market conditions.   <br>  <br> 12. Review (Required when action is valued at $100K or more) <br>  <br> Legal Counsel <br> Typed Name: Dylan Bush	 <br> DSN: 848-5237    <br> Signature:  	 <br> Date: 15 March 2013 <br>  <br> 13.  Contracting Officer's Approval:   Based on the foregoing, I approve the procurement of  quote mark the LCMS System quote mark  ordered under the description above on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) FAR 8.405-6(b) & (1) subject to availability of funds, and provided that the services and property herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition. <br>  <br>   <br> DATE: 						Samantha L.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award. <br>  <br> The work of this project involves demolishing, removing, and properly disposing of the existing built-up roof, and the installation of a new membrane roof on the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier pump station building.

<DESC>The work of this project involves repairing a wharf damaged by the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy.  The wharf is located on the eastern side of the inner basin of old harbor on Block Island, Rhode Island, and is in front of Ballard's Inn.  Numerous inboard pile caps have become elevated above the tops of the inboard timber piles.  The work involves removing some of the 4 quote mark  x 10 quote mark  deck planks and timber wheel guards in order to provide access to the pile caps.  Sand and rip rap will need to be excavated or moved around each of the inboard piles in order to provide the room necessary to reseat the pile caps on top of the piles.  Once the pile caps are reseated on the inboard piles, steel straps (two per pile) will be installed at each pile, including the outboard piles.  No excavation is necessary at the outboard piles.  After the pile caps have been reseated and the straps installed, the existing timber decking and timber wheel guards shall be reinstalled using existing hardware.  In addition, the inboard fascia board shall be replaced in-kind and two ladders on the outboard face of the wharf shall be replaced. <br>  <br> The work of the project requires construction operations immediately adjacent to a busy public restaurant.  Barricades and chain link safety fencing shall be installed in this location to separate the general public from the active construction areas of the project.  The barricades and safety fencing shall be installed prior to the start of all other onsite activities.  The Contractor shall modify and implement other construction methods as necessary to ensure the safety of the public in this area. <br>
