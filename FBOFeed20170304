<DESC><strong>1.0 Description</strong>
<p>1.1 NASA Ames Research Center is seeking information on the feasibility of replacement for the existing Main Drive Speed Control (MDSC) of the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT). The new drive is anticipated to be a high efficiency design using modern variable speed frequency conversion components.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is only for the purpose of identifying potential sources as part of NASA's market research. It is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. No RFP exists; therefore do not request a copy of the RFP. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Government will not pay any costs associated with responses to this RFI. The intent of this RFI is to identify manufacturers of variable frequency drive systems of a size and performance that can be configured to control the NASA Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel main drive. Based on the responses from this RFI, vendors will be evaluated for their system's compatibility with the Unitary drive. An RFP for an engineering design study may be issued to those vendors whose RFI responses show suitability and sufficient engineering detail to warrant further development. If a firm requirement is developed and a solicitation is issued, the solicitation will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of Offerors and interested parties to monitor the Internet site for the release of special notices, solicitation and amendments, if any, and will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the documents. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.&nbsp;<br /><br />1.3 If a new MDSC system is procured in the future, it is anticipated that the new drive will be a design-build procurement for the MDSC system only. Installation of the drive system would be by NASA using manufacturer technical support. Design and fabrication of new foundations, bussing, motor modifications and removal of existing equipment (capacitor banks, breakers, and liquid rheostats) will be by the Government. It is anticipated that the new MDSC system will be procured with a "performance" specification using a best value approach; however this is subject to change in any anticipated RFP.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>2.1 The NASA Ames UPWT was commissioned in 1956 to support aeronautics research in the Mach 0.3 to 3.5 range. This is accomplished using two wind tunnel circuits of the UPWT that are independently driven by a common set of four wound rotor induction motors (WRIMs). Each of the four motors is presently rated at continuous operation of 65,000 horsepower after being rewound in 1997. All four of the electric motors are on a common shaft and operate at variable speed from 100 rpm to 710 rpm.</p>
<p>2.2 The overall description of the drive system is provided in Attachment 1. As shown in the single line diagram, incoming power from the grid is provided at voltages that vary between 116kV and 121kV (night to day typical). The incoming supply is lowered to a nominal voltage of 7200 V using a pair of transformers that provide power directly to the four motors. Each WRIM has a pair of stator windings that are fed through a pair of 2000 ampere vacuum breakers. Rotor resistance of each WRIM is varied using an external three phase rheostat. Speed control is accomplished by varying the rotor resistance using the position of the rheostat plates.</p>
<p>2.3 The scope of the entire project is described in Attachment 2. This RFI is intended to gage the feasibility of adapting commercially available variable frequency drive technology to the large wound rotor induction motors. Therefore, much of the document is background information for a basic understanding of the motivations behind the overall project.</p>
<p>2.4 The purpose and use of the existing MDSC is for three purposes. The first purpose is closed loop control of the pilot motors that position the rheostat electrode plates for speed control. The second purpose is closed loop control of the excitation of the dynamic braking generator set (used to control braking on motors 3 and 4). The third purpose is to open and close the vacuum breakers at the proper time for starting and motor addition/subtraction.</p>
<p>2.5 The only modification anticipated to the WRIMs is the removal of all rotor brushes and a subsequent shorting of the rotor phases to eliminate the variable resistance rheostat from the circuit. WRIM modification will be by the Government.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Proposed MDSC Requirements</strong></p>
<p>3.1 Proposed MDSC system shall provide variable frequency speed control to the existing WRIMs across a range of zero to 710 rpm with the ability to hold a speed set point within a range of 0.1 rpm. Drive speed acceleration for large speed changes (greater than 40 rpm) shall be 3 rpm/sec max. MDSC system shall be greater than 95% overall efficiency. System shall be designed to work with existing WRIM motor characteristics, excepting that the rheostat system will be removed from each motor (by NASA). Drive train mechanical equipment to be unchanged.</p>
<p>3.2 Inertial loads: The masses of the major components of the drive line are large. Each of the four motor rotors weighs 70 tons. All four motors are rigidly coupled together. The motors drive either of two large axial flow fans through a splined disconnect coupling. One fan weights 150 tons. The other weighs 450 tons. Thus, the rotating mass of the drive can vary from 430 tons (smaller fan coupled) to 730 tons with the large fan coupled. Drive acceleration, set point accuracy, and stability must account for the full range of mass and speeds.</p>
<p>3.3 Proposed MDSC system to incorporate power electronics building block (PEBB) technology with a system availability of 95%.</p>
<p>3.4 Proposed MDSC system shall maintain a lagging power factor as high as possible but not less than .95 and not more than 1.0 at all operating speeds.</p>
<p>3.5 Proposed MDSC system shall provide full soft starting capability (zero current to rated current).</p>
<p>3.6 Proposed MDSC system shall provide braking for speed reduction.</p>
<p>3.7 Proposed MDSC system components shall be designed to be installed in self-contained enclosures suitable for outdoor operation at Moffett Field.</p>
<p>3.8 If possible, proposed MDSC system shall use existing 115kV-7.2kV transformers and existing 7.2kV incoming breakers for connection to the grid. If the reuse of the existing transformers and breakers is not possible, explain in detail why additional/replacement electrical hardware is required.</p>
<p>3.9 Anticipated Delivery date: 3 years, after NTP in summer, 2018.</p>
<p><br /><strong>4.0 Requested Information</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Detailed system description including one line diagrams, component layouts, weights, sizes and installation requirements of the vendor's currently available system that would be adapted to meet these requirements along with a description of the details of the modifications required. Include a description of the proposed MDSC system along with recommended modifications/demolition to the existing system. For example, it is anticipated that the rheostats with associated bussing, capacitor banks and associated breakers, and the dynamic braking motor-generator set and associated breakers will not be required with the proposed system. Describe any exceptions to these requirements along with the technical reasons why these requirements cannot be met and a suggested alternative approach.</p>
<p>4.2 Ratings of proposed system, and ratings of all components that make up the system.</p>
<p>4.3 Proposed subcontractor supplied components.</p>
<p>4.4 Proposed hardware/software platforms.</p>
<p>4.5 Proposed control scheme for variable speed control at all required torques.</p>
<p>4.6 Recommended quality control for fabrication, testing and installation.</p>
<p>4.7 Recommended factory acceptance testing and associated inspection standard(s).</p>
<p>4.8 Potential risks including a full description of the maturity of the proposed system design.</p>
<p>4.9 System availability data, along with MTBF for major components.</p>
<p>4.10 Budgetary ROM cost including design, fabrication, testing, shipping and final delivery to Moffett Field (non-binding for planning purposes only).</p>
<p>4.11 Estimate of schedule for fabrication and delivery.</p>
<p>4.12 Design and Manufacturing experience with variable frequency system similar to this application. Include detailed description of any proposed COTS components.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.
