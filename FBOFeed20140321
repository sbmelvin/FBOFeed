<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/>Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing the XM153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS), recapitalization of the previously delivered XM153 CROWS, engineering and logistics services, and spares parts. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The Government has determined that a Full and Open Competition Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract will be utilized for the CROWS requirement.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract(s) under three (3) separate and distinct areas of its Statement of Work (SOW).  Each area will have a different contract type associated with it.  The three (3) areas of the SOW and the three (3) planned contract types associated with each one for this requirement are as follows:<br/><br/>I. Fixed-Price, IDIQ: To support production of a maximum of 18,000 CROWS, field maintenance support, and spares.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 300 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 500 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Fixed-Price Incentive, IDIQ:  To support product improvements, integrations, and testing.  Share line will be 50/50 with 120 percent ceiling as a point of departure. <br/><br/>III. Firm-Fixed-Price Level-of-Effort, IDIQ:  To support training, overhaul, depot-level maintenance and recapitalization of CROWS; and for general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification will consist of performance requirements and will specify technical drawings.  The detail specification will specify the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and/or how the items are to be fabricated or constructed.  Some sub-assemblies will not include technical drawings and assembly procedures.  Instead, data for those sub-assemblies will include directed source(s) or build-to-spec requirements or both. This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between multiple CROWS producers and commonality/interchangeability with the existing CROWS fleet.  The Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation but will not be included in the draft solicitation release:<br/><br/>Detail Specification<br/>   -     Performance requirements<br/>   -     Technical Drawings<br/>   -     Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/>   -     Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/>   -     Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/>   -     Assembly procedures<br/>   -     List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/>   -     Quality requirements <br/>   -     Test requirements<br/>   -     Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be provided at any time nor will Contractors have access to the data. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the US Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be handled utilizing a software change process between the US Government and Contractor(s). <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be available after Request for Proposal release upon request provided that all necessary paper work is properly completed by the requester, submitted, and approved prior to any release.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit a DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, and Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided. The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (Other Foreign) must complete and submit a AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire and a Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided and also be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced.  <br/><br/>This announcement serves as notification that export control procedures regulated by the ITAR are in effect on the above stated data. Contractors that are interested in receiving this data must be in compliance with the ITAR and possess the proper authorities to receive this data and are encouraged to do so as soon as possible.  The data will be marked Distribution Statement  B  Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies only.   All other requests for this data shall be referred to Project Manager Soldier Weapons.  Foreign vendors and contractors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for Contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR.  Contractors may consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and may consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions they may have relating to compliance with the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).  Please reference the following link consulting these regulations http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers. The GFM may include full up XM153 CROWS systems, select parts and weapons. Contractors must make the appropriate accommodations to be approved for handling and storage of weapons. Government support may be provided to assist in understanding the setup and use of the XM153 CROWS and its operation following contract award. <br/><br/>The present schedule projects a release of a draft solicitation on or about 3QFY11.  An Industry Day will be announced during the draft solicitation release and further details shall be posted on FedBizOpps.gov (https://www.fbo.gov/). All responses to this notice shall be in writing in the English language and be at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>This requisition is for 10 Thermo Fisher Scientific TermoFlex Water cooled Recirculating Chillers.&nbsp; These chillers would provide chilled water to cool the magnets and electronics of our Thermo Fisher Scientific high resolution mass spectrometry instruments.&nbsp; The ThermoFlex Water cooled Recirculating Chillers provide an operationa pressure set to 40 psi, which is preferred to the house water pressure of 50 psi.&nbsp; The chillers are the only ones that certifed for use with the Thermo Fisher Scientific DFS high resolution mass spectrometry instruments in use in our lab, that can transfer instrument generated heat to the house chilled water without pumping this impure water through the instrument itself. Direct plumbing of the house chilled water without a recirlulating chiller could lead to instrument damage requiring costly repairs in excess of $200,000.

<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC>The goal of ALASA is to develop a significantly less expensive approach for launching small satellites routinely, with a goal of at least threefold reduction in costs compared to current military and US commercial launch costs.  ALASA seeks to develop and employ radical advances in launch systems, to include the development of a complete launch vehicle requiring no recurring maintenance or support, and no specific integration to prepare for launch. The ALASA demonstration system will draw upon emerging technologies to provide increased specific impulse propellants, stable propellant formulations, hybrid propellant systems, potential "infrastructure-free" cryogen production, new motor case materials, new flight controls and mission planning techniques, new nozzle designs, improved thrust vectoring methods, and new throttling approaches.
<p>For a detailed description of this opportunity please see the attached file - DARPA-BAA-12-07 (ALASA).</p>

<p>The Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is seeking a charter vessel and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to participate in a priority research project relative to the deep sea coral off the northeast coast. This project is in the second of three (3) years of work that is being funded by NOAA's Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program in the northeast, as part of a larger national focus on the nation's coral and sponge resources. The vessel and ROV system chartered will be involved in conducting an imaging survey of deep sea corals and sponges in the Gulf of Maine. The selected vessel will be required to operate an ROV system to optically image the sea floor on, more or less, a 24 hour basis and collect specimens for shipboard and laboratory analyses. The purpose of the survey will be to survey and collect voucher specimens to confirm species identifications and for aging, genetics, and reproduction studies. The results of this survey will be used to document the occurrence, abundance, and life histories of the various coral and sponge species in the Gulf and contribute to the management and conservation of these groups of animals. The planned period of performance is up to 15 days at sea during the period of May - July 2014, preferably one block of time during that period.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Cost Reimbursement contract to Raytheon Missiles Systems (RMS), 1151 East Hermans Road, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337 for Increment III of the AIM-9X Block II System Improvement Program (SIP III). This program is for the design, development, integration, and test of hardware modifications to meet component obsolescence and Cost Reduction Initiative requirements, and for the design, development, integration and test of software modifications of the Operational Flight software (OFS) to enhance system performance, support Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and expand platform integration readiness. The Contract will also provide for aircraft integration on threshold and objective aircraft platforms.In 1996, Hughes Missile Systems Company (subsequently acquired by Raytheon Missile Systems (Raytheon)) was competitively selected to be the designer, developer, manufacturer and integrator of the AIM-9X missile. At that time, the Government did not procure a Technical Data Package (TDP) for re-procurement purposes and required Raytheon to retain configuration control of items not effecting the system specification. In order to award a contract for the efforts described in this synopsis to any source other than Raytheon, the Government would have to procure the TDP and invest substantial funds in qualifying a second source. Therefore, the efforts described in this synopsis cannot be performed by any source other than Raytheon without substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition. The authority for Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Anticipated date of award is 27 August 2015. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Telephone inquiries or responses will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Construction services are required for a design-bid-build project funded by the Government of Japan (GoJ) direct cash contributions (otherwise referred to as the Mamizu funds).
<p>The Guam International Agreement was approved in February 2009 between the United States Government and the Government of Japan. The agreement outlined a realignment of Marine Corps elements to reduce United States military footprint in Okinawa, including the relocation of forces from Japan to Guam. The North Ramp Area Development Plan was completed in May 2012 to ensure all aviation requirements and support facilities and infrastructure were efficiently identified and sited within the AAFB North Ramp area. The majority of the USMC North Ramp area is undeveloped and requires significant site improvements, grading, earthwork, utility infrastructure, fencing, and roadways to support vertical construction. The USMC Aviation Combat Element (ACE) requires operational, maintenance, administrative, and support facilities to conduct the mission requirements of the 1st MAW elements operating out of AAFB North Ramp.</p>
<p>The scope of work includes utilities infrastructure and site development consisting of electrical, water, wastewater, communications, drainage, roads, security fencing, site improvements, and earthwork in support of future North Ramp construction. Structures include construction of a new 13.8kv switching station located west of the North Ramp area. Other utilities infrastructure include electrical distribution lines from the main AAFB substation to the new switching station and the North Ramp area and communication lines from Building 25008 to the North Ramp area. Plumbing and HVAC facilities are provided for the North Ramp Switching Station Building. The project also includes environmental mitigation and minor demolition.</p>
<p>NAVFAC Pacific is the Department of Defense's Executive Agent for Construction on Guam and is the designated design and construction agent.</p>
<p>The estimated dollar value range is between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237130 (Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction), with average annual receipts of $33.5 million over the past three years. This procurement is being advertised on an UNRESTRICTED basis, inviting full and open competition. The Government reserves the right to cancel the procurement if only one proposal is received or less than three Offerors are evaluated as eligible for award.</p>
<p>This procurement will utilize lowest priced technically acceptable procedures, requiring the submission of both technical and price proposals. The technical evaluation factors are anticipated to be as follows: FACTOR 1: Offeror's Relevant Experience; FACTOR 2: Offeror's Relevant Past Performance; FACTOR 3: Workforce Housing and Logistics and Material Management Plan; FACTOR 4: Technical Approach; SUBFACTOR 4(A): Key Personnel/Qualification; SUBFACTOR 4(B): Management Plan/Project Schedule; FACTOR 5: Safety.</p>
<p>A Pre-proposal conference is scheduled for Tuesday, 13 May 2014 at 8:30 a.m., Guam Standard Time (GST) at Top O'MAR, Nimitz Hill, Guam. A site visit will be held immediately after the conference. A maximum of three (3) representatives will be allowed per firm.

There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional costs, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.

<DESC>1.) SYNOPSIS:  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  The proposed services, which will be obtained by negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contracts, are for a variety of Architect/Engineer services primarily for Army Reserve projects nationwide (including Puerto Rico) and military projects within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division mission boundaries.  Projects outside the primary mission area may be added at the Government's discretion upon agreement of the A/E firm.   <br>  <br> Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. The maximum cumulative contract value for the total contract is $9,000,000.  This is a five year contract, with no option years.  The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $3,000,000 and $50,000,000.   <br>  <br> Up to four firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second, and so on.  Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload.  If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between firms considered as technically equal.  The following factors will be used in deciding which offeror will be selected to negotiate task orders: performance, quality of deliverables, capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience.  Significant emphasis will be placed on the A/E's quality control procedures, as the district will perform the quality assurance role only.  Estimated start date is July 2013.   <br>  <br> If a large business is selected to negotiate a contract, the firm will be required to present an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507 prior to award of the contract.  The current subcontracting goals are 50.0 percent to Small Business, 18.0 percent to Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), 17.0 percent to Small Disadvantaged Business, 4.0 percent to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 10.0 percent to HUB Zone Small Business, and 4.0 percent to Veteran Owned Small Business.  These percentages are applied to the total amount of subcontracted dollars.   <br>  <br> The Louisville District and the U.S. Army Reserve plan to partner this program.  The selected firms and relevant subconsultants will be required to attend annual two-day partnering workshops for all architecture, engineering and interior design disciplines to define the Government's expectations of the A/E, create a positive working atmosphere, encourage open communication, and to identify common goals.  Cost for these sessions will be borne by the selected A/E.   <br>  <br> In accordance with FAR 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $30,000 will receive a performance evaluation.  A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time.  Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for Architect-Engineer Services.   <br>  <br> 2.) PROJECT SPECIFIC INFORMATION:  The selected firm will be solely responsible for the designs that they produce, and will become the designer of record for each individual project on their contract.

<DESC><p>AFLCMC/EBYA, Eglin AFB FL has a requirement for QF-16 Radar Cross Section (RCS) Verification and Validation Testing. Under Title X of the US Code, Section 2366, air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons are required to be live fired at threat representative targets as part of a weapons lethality verification process prior to entering full-scale production. In order for the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) to support this weapons lethality assessment, its Radio Frequency (RF) signature (commonly referred to as Radar Cross Section) must be known with significant confidence. Historical data (weapon programs lessons learned) established that "sufficient confidence" in a full-scale aerial target's RCS can only be obtained through measurement. RCS measurement test methods require the presence of all the target's spatially distributed radar scattering centers in order to provide accurate results.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall be responsible for conducting the RCS test at a Contractor-provided test facility.</p>
<p>2. QF-16 Radar Cross Section testing must yield data suitable for supporting the QF-16 RCS model verification and validation and weapons lethality verification process referenced above. Diagnostic analysis is fundamental to the effectiveness of this process and requires the following specific data "quality" or "suitability" features:</p>
<p>a. Repeatability - The test conditions and collection techniques must be capable of being controlled and reproduced.</p>
<p>b. Granularity - RCS measurements shall be made in one degree increments through 360 degrees of azimuth for each pitch attitude. Pitch attitude shall range from +/- 30 degrees (threshold) through +/- 50 degrees (objective) relative to the local ground, plane in 5 degree increments. This all-aspect RCS data shall be collected for two aircraft configurations (with and without mission representative payloads). Discrete frequency (multiple bands) and wide band data supporting high resolution target imagery shall be collected. <br /><br />c. Accuracy - RCS measurement sources of error must be well understood, documented, and able to be mitigated effectively through precise instrumentation calibration, environment control, and proven data processing techniques.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall deliver a test plan and test report in accordance with Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) DI-NDTI-80566A and DI-NDTI-80809B, respectively.</p>
<p>4. The Government will provide as Government Furnished Property (GFP) a flightworthy Have Glass I, Block 25 QF-16 aircraft with mission representative payloads to the Contractor for use as the RCS test article. The airworthiness of this QF-16 must not be compromised as it is an active program test asset. No modification to the internal or external structure is permitted.</p>
<p>5. The period of performance for this entire effort is six months after contract award.</p>
<p>Potential offerors who have the capability to meet the performance and schedule requirements outlined above are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC). The SOC shall be limited to 35 pages as defined below. Please include the following information in the SOC:</p>
<p>1. Summarize overall capabilities considering the criteria above. The page limit is five (5) pages (not including graphics/tabular data).<br /><br />2. Summarize proposed range certification process and then identify and explain those range/facility certification procedures, activities, and criteria (benchmarks) that are specific to ensuring measurement accuracy and quantifying measurement uncertainty. Page limit 10 (not including graphics/tabular data).</p>
<p>3. Provide a measurement uncertainty analysis summary for the proposed test range/facility. Include a detailed description and assessment of all measureable and non-measureable (theoretical) error contribution artifacts. Describe any non-standard, or tailored calibration requirements to assure a high confidence understanding of data accuracy. The analysis should address computational method(s) and a meaningful characterization of the data used to quantify error. Identify error sources prone to variation during the course of testing/data collection and discuss (quantify where possible) error mitigation techniques. Also, identify and assess error sources that will not be mitigated. Frequency band of principal interest is X band. Page limit 20 (not including graphics/tabular data).</p>
<p>Note: Characterize and quantify where possible all phenomena that impede accurate calibration and RCS measurements made within a quiet zone with dimensions supporting all-aspect measurement of a QF-16 aircraft including pitch attitudes up to 50 deg (nose down). Consider "accurate calibration and measurement" as representing the fidelity of calibration and test measurements currently published for the facility. Describe any modification, or adjustments to data reduction processes or methods that may be advisable as a result of this effort.</p>
<p>Responses are requested by 3:00 PM CDT 18 April 2014.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 10, Market Research, this is a sources sought to determine the availability of potential sources/vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform/provide the stated requirements for ICD-10 instruction. All interested contractors are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information. This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement. 
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, (ICD-10) Procedure Coding System/Clinical Modification (PCS/CM) implementation support services.  At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  Questions will not be entertained at this time.   Respond only to requested information and questions below.  The purpose of this is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (Hubzone, 8(a), small, small disadvantage, service disabled veteran owned small business, or large business) relative to NAICS 621111 (size standard of $10.0 Million). Responses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. 


STATEMENT OF NEED
The Veterans Administration (VA) Healthcare System of Ohio (VISN10) is seeking support to provide American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) certified ICD-10 Coding Instruction on ICD-10 Clinical Modules/Procedure Coding System (CM/PCS) to its Health Care Providers (HCPs) throughout the Network.  
The vendor shall be expected to provide ICD-10 CM/PCS training for (HCPs) in order to enable a successful transition to this new coding system before 9/30/2014. Training and deployment plans will need to be specific to each of these broad learner categories as (HCP) training needs, learning styles, and availability are quite different. In addition, specific sub-populations within each of these groups will need more in-depth and focused training based on gaps from pre-assessments, types of services provided, workload and fiscal implications. Further, all training must be delivered without VA participant travel and/or via virtual modalities as described below in order to reach the broadest possible audience in the most cost-effective manner.

Since the financial health of the facilities in this VISN is in large part dependent on this endeavor, this project will require significant vendor capability, time and expertise to ensure that all deliverables are successfully met in a comprehensive and timely fashion.

1. BACKGROUND and JUSTIFICATION OF NEED
Effective October 1, 2014, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will require public and private sectors to convert from using ICD- 9 CM coding convention to ICD-10 CM/PCS. This is a change from a 17,849 code system to a new code structure containing 140,658 codes; an increase of some 87%. 

The transition to ICD-10 is a major undertaking for the entire health care industry; to include providers, payers and vendors. It will drive business and systems changes throughout the entire nation, from large national health plans to small provider offices, laboratories, medical testing centers, hospitals, and more. 

To ensure a smooth transition, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities need to devote staff time and financial resources to convert activities. Within VISN10, this change is expected to substantially and primarily impact revenue, reporting/clinical documentation, planning processes, and business systems. A successful transition to ICD-10 will be vital to ensuring fiscal viability and uninterrupted operations.

VISN10 is participating in this initiative as they have a stake in minimizing billing errors and refusals resulting in delayed or denied payments. The Network has been assessing current systems and gaps in preparation of this transition in concert with centralized direction and resources from the VA Central Office in Washington DC. 

VISN10's medical facilities have ~6000 providers to serve over 227, 000 veterans annually; with over 30,000 admissions and ~3.2 million outpatient visits per year. 

Related health care services provided by this VISN includes a full range of outpatient and institutional treatment, acute and chronic care (including specialty and subspecialty clinics), as well as preventative, restorative, and palliative services.

2. SCOPE AND CONTRACT CONSIDERATIONS
The scope of this project is ICD-10 CM/PCS training for all HCPs in VISN10.


HCPs are defined as physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and others involved with documenting the diagnosis and treatment of conditions associated with billable services.

Associated tasks and deliverables for HCPs should run concurrently and interdependently as indicated to ensure that appropriate testing of each target group's contributions can occur before the "go live date" of the ICD-10 transition.  This will make certain an accurate bill for services is verified and confirmed prior to October 1, 2014.  

Anticipated deliverables related to the tasks delineated in the following section and routine project management activities are detailed below. Given the complex nature of this project, the exact deliverables may be modified based on discussions between the VISN10 ICD-10 Steering Committee Chair and the contractor. The schedule of deliverables will be determined by the committee after project kick-off and will be incorporated into the contractor's project plan.  

VISN10 will provide the contractor with necessary background and informational materials related to the project functions to assist in completing all contract activities.

All information technology (IT) tools used in support of this contract must conform to available VHA infrastructure, and where possible should be based on the Microsoft Office suite of products.

The contractor will provide graphics design and production support sufficient for supporting key tasks and deliverables detailed in the contract.

The vendor must have documented evidence of current ownership of extensive training materials and curricula prior to the contract award as well as evidence of the ability to modify these appropriately to customize to client specific needs.

The platform is used globally, to allow partners to continue to communicate, build communities of practice, and share information. System requirements are defined by the user community, prioritized and scoped by the Government Program Manager, discussed with the contractor prior to coding, and subsequently bundled into a release of manageable size based on mutual agreement by the Government and contractor. The objective is to continue to operate the current technology solution IAW DoD guidance meeting net centric and information sharing standards and deliver new functionality within that framework. This effort is to maintain services for the GlobalNET user community.

<p><strong>HiSeq 2500, (Specified Brand Name: Illumina) NO REFURBISHED OR USED SYSTEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.</strong></p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) led the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) contribution to the International Human Genome Project, which had as its primary goal the sequencing of the human genome. This project was successfully completed in April 2003. Now, the NHGRI's mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals.</p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a high-throughput sequencing center supporting all institutes within the NIH. NISC has served the NIH community for over 15 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for NISC services. NISC currently has one (1) HiSeq 25000, three (3) MiSeq Systems, three (3) Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) IIx, and four (4) HiSeq 2000 Systems which are proven platforms for genetic analysis and functional genomics. This instrument's parallel sequencing technology leverages clonal cluster formation and proprietary reversible terminator chemistry to give it the speed and reduce the cost of large-scale sequencing to generate billions of bases of high-quality DNA sequence per run.</p>
<p>The HiSeq 2500 System provides ultra-high output and speed. In a single run one is able to sequence more than 5 human genomes at ~30x coverage. The HiSeq 2500 system is able to process a diverse set of samples within one flow cell, and with the highest data quality currently available. Another key factor in this selection is that this instrument is able to run in an alternate rapid mode which would allow the researchers to decrease turnaround time by many weeks. This is a critical consideration for projects impacting patient diagnosis. The HiSeq 2500 can be switched between a high throughput mode and rapid turnaround run mode. In high throughput run mode, similar to the HiSeq 2000, the HiSeq 2500 enables sequencing of a large number of genomes, exomes, or transcriptomes in a single run, allowing large studies to be completed with the fewest number of runs. In rapid run mode, the HiSeq 2500 is capable of sequencing a 30x genome in a day or completing fast multiplexed applications such as exome resequencing or RNA-Seq. The rapid run time includes automated, on-instrument cluster generation, and paired-end sequencing, with no user intervention needed throughout the entire process.&nbsp;<br /><br />B. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>The HiSeq 2500 also allows researchers to process samples by a single method that is compatible with HiSeq 2000 and HiSeq 2500. This simplifies the NISC lab processes, minimizing labor and equipment costs, and gives researchers the flexibility to route samples to either machine type depending on the needs of the project and machine availability. The high speed of the HiSeq 2500, means that reagents sit out for a shorter period of time and decay to a lesser degree during the run. The result is longer, more accurate reads (300 vs 200 bases). This allows NISC to expand the sequencing applications supported on this platform, as some supplications require longer reads.</p>

<DESC><p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541711 for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>World events over the last fourteen years have highlighted the growing threat of terrorism&nbsp;in its many forms, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the 1995 Tokyo sarin gas attack, the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on September 11, 2001, and the deliberate spread of anthrax and ricin through the U.S. postal service and Congressional office buildings. These incidents provide insight into the range of approaches used by terrorists, including the potential to use chemical, biological, and radiological/nuclear weapons. Acts of radiological or nuclear terrorism could involve the use of stolen or improvised nuclear devices, attacks on nuclear power plants or reactors, the detonation of radiological dispersal devices ("dirty bombs," which combine radioactive material with conventional explosives), or the placement of radiation sources in public locations or in food or water supplies.</p>
<p>The effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure. Radiation injury is directly proportional to the dose absorbed by the body and radiosensitive tissues. Depending on the dose of whole-body or partial-body exposure to external radiation, the effects can range from an increased risk of cancer years after exposure to more acute effects, including transient nausea and vomiting; hematopoietic and gastrointestinal injury, leading to immunosuppression and infection; metabolic abnormalities; hemorrhage and anemia; damage to the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and central nervous systems; and death.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The United States Government has recognized the need for improved medical countermeasures against such threats. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) charged the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with building and managing a program to develop products for the mitigation or treatment of radiation injuries from exposures due to nuclear and radiological attacks.</p>
<p>This solicitation will support research and development of radiation and nuclear medical countermeasures towards licensure or approval. The supported work will encompass work performed in the drug development pathway as well as the administrative foundation necessary to facilitate and coordinate these activities in partnership with NIAID. One Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract will be awarded to an organization to provide the comprehensive suite of product development services. The work will be directed and funded using Task Orders.</p>
<p>Project requirements</p>
<p>The purpose of proposed solicitation, entitled "Radiation/Nuclear Medical Countermeasure Product Development Support Services," is to recompete the effort to provide services, facilities, expertise and capabilities for the development of radiation/nuclear medical countermeasures (MCMs) for 1) the mitigation or treatment of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE). The Contractor will not identify or conduct basic research on new medical countermeasures. The NIAID anticipates that products selected by the government for screening, testing, and development will come from industry, academia, and government agencies. The work to be performed under this contract will be initiated by NIAID.</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br />This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br />Background: <br />Genetics Home Reference (GHR), a program of the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, is an online resource that provides balanced and reliable consumer-friendly information about the effects of genetic variations on human health. The GHR website (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/) contains plain-language summaries of more than 900 genetic conditions, more than 1,100 genes, all of the human chromosomes, 100 gene families, and an extensively illustrated handbook that outlines the fundamentals of human genetics. GHR also offers links to other trusted material on the web that provides foundational information to users. <br />GHR is one of the Library's most relied-upon resources, with a 2013 average of more than 48,800 median daily unique IPs visiting the site and 38.7 million hits per month. With this high public visibility, timely review of existing topics is an essential element for maintaining an accurate and useful website. With the huge explosion of genetic information and the clinical consequences associated with the completion of the human genome sequence, GHR could enhance its public offerings through the skills and resources of an organization with a broad membership of genetics support and advocacy groups. The professional services to be provided will increase the efficiency of content updates for the GHR website. <br />The services provided through this contract will build on existing processes, templates, and documentation established over the past 3 years. The deliverables created by this contract will include "Alerts" from the relevant disease advocacy community, requested and tracked by the contractor. These Alerts will help GHR keep its disease-specific information for the public up-to-date. <br />Required Task: <br />Provide GHR with "Alerts" when important new information is available about conditions, genes, and other information currently available on the GHR website to help GHR keep the site content up-to-date. <br />Appropriately credentialed contractor staff will solicit, coordinate, and prepare information obtained from disorder-specific member groups and those groups' scientific advisory boards using previously developed processes and template documents. Contractor will assess the accuracy and applicability of Alerts and submit them to GHR using the established work flow process and available template . The contractor will contact member groups regularly to request new Alerts and will follow up with member groups to maximize participation and ensure Alerts are received in a timely fashion. Details of these contacts and follow-ups will be tracked via spreadsheet or similar mechanism.<br />The contractor will participate in twice-monthly conference calls with GHR staff and occasional face-to-face meetings, as requested, to discuss status, progress, and any current issues or challenges. The contractor will also provide brief monthly status reports and an annual report that includes relevant metrics, such as number of member groups solicited, amount of follow-up performed, number of unresponsive member groups, and number of Alerts sent to GHR staff.<br />Other Important Considerations<br />The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 12.6. Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation of Commercial Items and FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement / quotation which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.<br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:

<DESC><p>The intent of this project is to repair the exterior facades for Buildings 3 &amp; 5 and Buildings 9 &amp; 10 and to replace leaky and damaged windows in Building 9 &amp; 10 at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) A summary of the work is as follows, the window systems are original (+35 years old) and are at the end of their service life. Insulated glazing units have sealant failures, the window frames are deteriorating and gaskets are brittle and ineffective. With the window technology advances over this time period which has introduced thermally broken frames and low-E glazing; a window replacement along with stabilization of the precast panels would restore the building's thermal and moisture performance to better than it was when it was originally constructed. These benefits would serve to extend the service life of the facility into the future. In addition to improved thermal and moisture performance, the new windows will be installed in compliance with the UFC and ATFP criteria for blast resistance.</p>

<p>Description:<br /><br />Sources Sought Notices (herein referred to as a Request for Information) are issued by the Department of State when performing market research to determine industry interest and capabilities. The Department of State is interested in the capabilities of both small and other than small businesses to perform the services. This is a Request for Information announcement only.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation or request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission of this Request for Information nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>The Department of State reserves the right to terminate this request and change its requirements if needed. Responding to this Request for Information does not guarantee participation in future Department activities.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Department of State leads the United States in its relationships with foreign governments, international organizations, and people of other countries. The Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM) provides the information technology (IT) and services the Department needs to successfully carry out its foreign policy mission. Currently, IRM provides the design, engineering, provision, operations and maintenance support services for desktops, servers, networks, security and enterprise applications across the Department.</p>
<p>IRM is also responsible for formulating the next generation strategies for Department wide IT. In recent years, major improvements have been made to the Department's IT global networks, mobile computing, cloud computing, enterprise security, standardized hardware refresh and the creation and management of information in support of diplomacy. The Department needs to continue to plan for further improvements in its future strategic plans, tactical plans, and architectures.</p>
<p>The Strategic Planning Division (SPD) is one of three divisions located in the Strategic Planning Office in IRM's Business, Management, and Planning Directorate. SPD is made up of three portfolios: Strategic Planning, eGovernment, and Inspections, Audits, and Compliance.</p>
<p>The Strategic Planning portfolio's primary responsibility is developing the Department's IT Strategic Plan and IT Tactical Plan. These plans set out the IT strategic direction for the Department from the Chief Information Officer (CIO). To date there have been four iterations of the strategic plan: 2001-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2013 and 2014-2016 (current plan). SPD is beginning the process of creating the next strategic plan for FY 2017-2019. Another major responsibility of the Strategic Planning portfolio is to develop IRM's Functional Bureau Strategy and portions of the Bureau Resource Request. These plans detail the bureau's top priorities over a three-year period and request the funding and resources needed to implement those priorities. Additionally, Strategic Planning is responsible for a variety of other key functions including: white papers, ad hoc taskings, decision support and talking points for senior management, information collection and analysis on IT industry trends, and Department-wide cloud computing advocacy and guidance.</p>
<p>The eGovernment portfolio's primary responsibility is to track and report on all IT requirements originated by Executive Orders and eGovernment initiatives and Lines of Business (LOB), etc. The Executive Orders involve extensive coordination across bureaus and offices to meet multiple deadlines. eGovernment initiatives and LOBs includes meeting on and negotiating Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) between the Department and Managing Partner agencies for CIO signature. The portfolio is responsible for generating the annual eGovernment Act Report submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Another major responsibility is leading the Department's Open Government effort as required by OMB. This portfolio chairs the Open Government Working Group made up of representatives from different offices and bureaus throughout the Department. The eGovernment portfolio develops the Department's Open Government Plan on behalf of the CIO and Under Secretary for Management. Additionally, this portfolio is responsible for managing and implementing the Digital Government Strategy on behalf of the Department, to include chairing the Digital Services Advisory Group. Finally, eGovernment is responsible for the Department's IT sustainability efforts per the President's Executive Order 13514 for Federal Sustainability. eGovernment develops IRM's portion of the Agency Sustainability Plan (Goal 7) submitted annually to OMB as well as the Department's Electronic Stewardship Scorecard.</p>
<p>The Inspections, Audits, and Compliance (IAC) portfolio serves as the right-arm for the CIO directing the process and responding to the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) Inspections, Compliance, Program Evaluation, assessment, Reviews, Special Reports, and Management Memoranda. IAC liaises as IRM's point of contact for recommendations involving other bureaus assigned as action and IRM is a coordinating entity. Another major responsibility of IAC is to coordinate and respond to Freedom of Information Act inquiries assigned to IRM. Additionally, IAC is responsible for liaising between IRM and the Office of the Legal Advisor and its attorneys regarding IRM involvement with eDiscovery and litigation hold requirements regarding electronically stored information.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives and Requirements:</p>
<p>The Department is seeking sources capable of a) providing services to support the Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM) and the Department's information technology (IT) Strategic planning processes, including the development of relevant strategic planning products and services that provide current and out year guidance to critical program areas; and b) providing management and support for various Office of Management and Budget (OMB) initiatives and Presidential Executive Orders related to the eGovernment Act of 2002, Open Government, Digital Government Strategy and IT Sustainability under the General Services Administration (GSA) IT 70 and Mission Oriented Business Integrated Service (Schedule 874) Federal Supply Schedules (FSS).</p>

<CONTACT>WIKIKI HENTON, 407-384-5265

<a href="mailto:wikiki.l.henton.civ@mail.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) / PM Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (PM CATT) / PM Special Operations Forces Training Systems (PM STS) intends to modify the Call For Fire Trainer (CFFT) III Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract to increase the contract ceiling from $45,000,000 to $100,000,000.  The IDIQ contract was awarded on August 15, 2012 as a one year base period and 4 - one year optional periods to Nova Technologies and Employee Owned Engineering Company, 429 S. Tyndall Parkway, Suite S., Panama City, FL 32404-6747, DUNS:  017444196.  <br> 1)	Background/History/Program Description: The CFFT is the U.S. Army's choice for training all Soldiers in the basics of call for fire and for providing both basic and advanced training to Forward Observers (MOS 13F).  The CFFT is a lightweight, rapidly deployable, observed fire training system that provides simulated battlefield training for Fire Support Specialists, Joint Fires Observers (JFO), and Soldiers at the institutional and unit level. CFFT IIIs provide improved capabilities that replaces legacy CFFTs which utilize proprietary software and databases making technical support difficult and sustainment cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> The USSOCOM JFPL JTAC Trainer is a modular, scalable, PC-based system designed to provide training for both Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel in Terminal Attack Control (TAC), Fire Support (FS) coordination training, and mission rehearsal.  The JTAC Trainer can operate in a stand-alone mode or in a networked, interoperable mode, connected to other simulators using Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) or High-Level Architecture (HLA).  The JTAC Trainer is interoperable with multiple simulators and network with other command and service simulators.  Networking to aircraft and ground simulators for mission rehearsal or joint exercises in the virtual battle space enables forces involved in operations to simulate and evaluate mission options.  The JTAC Trainer supplements field training to provide realistic introductory, upgrade and proficiency training; reduce training costs associated with live exercises; and enhance mission success by providing mission rehearsal in the joint synthetic battle space.  The JTAC Trainer is a training solution to deliver USSOCOM JTAC training systems that support both classroom (throughput) and immersive (certification) training.  The JTAC Trainers have been accredited by the Joint Fires Support Executive Steering Committee (JFS ESC) for Close Air Support (CAS) Types I-III, Day/ Night and Laser Engagements without Restriction and can substitute two (2) of the six (6) required calls every six (6) months for currency.  The JFPL systems utilize the JFPL architecture and processes, which provide product line configurations and modules for both the US Army and USSOCOM that, consist of the following, as a minimum: <br> a)	JFPL Classroom Configurations.  The classroom configurations as well as the classroom variants shall be designed to train and enhance skills for Warfighters in delivery of fires.  There are currently four (4) classroom configurations and three (3) variants for the JFPL CFFT III. The classroom configurations include: the one instructor to four (4) trainees (1:4), one instructor to twelve (12) trainees (1:12), and one instructor to thirty (30) trainees (1:30).  There is an additional configuration of one instructor to thirty (30) trainees (1:30) including six (6) enhanced student stations instead of one. The three (3) (1:4) classroom variants include the Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) variant, Enhanced Display (ED) variant, and the Mobile Team Trainer (MTT) variant.   In addition, there are multiple classroom configurations of the JFPL JTAC Trainer having from one (1) to five (5) advanced trainee stations with full VME capability. <br>  <br> b)	JFPL Immersive Modules.  The JFPL CFFT III immersive modules shall provide a dynamic, immersive, virtual environment to support more advanced training capabilities.  The modules include individual and team training systems oriented on training the cognitive skills required by the Warfighter.  The modules include the Adaptive Full Spectrum Module (AFSM), Urban Terrain Module (UTM), Close Air Support Module (CASM), Fires Effect Cell Module (FECM), JTAC JFPL Dome, and After Action Review Module (AARM).  The JFPL JTAC immersive configurations include JTAC Phase II Trainer which is similar to the AFSM with a large display screen, berm and SME; and the JTAC Phase III Dome Trainer which is an immersive trainer with an immersive dome display system, berm and SME. <br> c)	JFPL Simulated Military Equipment (SME).  The JFPL simulates Military Equipment listed below and uses both six-DOF and three-DOF tracking to correlate SME views with the panoramic battlefield views to support both the immersive and classroom configurations. For all SME, Virtual Military Equipment (VME) using a virtual graphical user interface is provided for each Enhanced Trainee station.  The JFPL SME/VME currently includes the following: <br> 1.	Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR) <br> 2.	LLDR 2H (VME Only) <br> 3.	Mark VII (VME Only) <br> 4.	Vector 21 <br> 5.	M 22 Binocular <br> 6.	IZLID <br> 7.	Compass <br> 8.	Mission Clock <br> 9.	Ground Laser Target Designator II (GLTD II) <br> 10.	DAGR <br> 11.	PRC-117G  <br> 12.	PVS-14 Night Vision Goggle  <br> 13.	SOFLAM (VME Only) <br> 14.	Pocket Laser Range Finder (PLRF 15C)  <br> 15.	Enhanced Joint Terminal Attack Controller Laser Target Designator (EJTAC LTD)  <br> 16.

Office of Performance Management (OPM) 
Enhanced Automation of Performance Reviews - 
Linking Performance, Strategy, and Budget

The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice / Request for Information (RFI) to request responses from qualified businesses capable of providing the requirements below. The responses to this RFI will contribute to determining the method of procurement and identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT

Those who manage agency strategy, performance and budgets are often not the same people, whether at the headquarters level or in large, diverse components. Automation can significantly help these officials work together by capturing common data elements, their relationship to one another, the workflow they support, and the deliverables they populate - while increasing the speed, accessibility, and accuracy of these efforts. As these management processes operate, dynamic linkages between performance, strategies and budgets simplify coordination challenges and permit a more efficient and effective program to emerge. Moreover, requests and reports that are able to demonstrate dynamic linkages among strategy, performance and budgets are better able to make the agency's case for support.

While these benefits have been stated many times, and statutory requirements increasingly compel such linkage, there appear to be few examples of enterprise-spanning success that touches on the disparate offices that would be expected to participate in such efforts. In turn, there seem to be few end-to-end process tools that have been developed by vendors, or supported by implementers, that have shown success across multiple phases of workflow, or with multiple organizational levels supported.

VA's Office of Performance Management is responsible for all aspects of collecting and disseminating information and reports about enterprise performance of the VA organization and its major components.  In this role, the Office seeks to assist leaders and managers of all phases of the resource claiming, allocating, and reporting processes to better realize the linkages between our strategic objectives, our budgets, and our organizational performance.

First, VA seeks to receive information about "success stories" wherein agencies have dynamically linked enterprise-wide performance, strategic objectives and budgets.  Alternatively, examples at a level lower than the full enterprise are welcome if they have broader applicability.   Second, VA seeks to learn what technical solutions are available in the existing marketplace, whether they have been implemented or not.  As VA currently uses every manner of tool for Business Intelligence (BI), from spreadsheets to SharePoint, to standalone BI tools and enterprise resource planning-scale systems, we wish to learn about the full gamut of alternatives, including opportunities that may lay "down the road" on a roadmap of possible alternatives.  Third, VA wishes to understand the "lessons learned" regarding the variety of alternatives.  Fourth, VA is not only interested in technical solutions, but also opportunities for learning and/or process change which may present themselves.  Fifth, VA is interested in learning how these linkages can be maintained and used across all phases of the resource management process, from strategic/performance planning to programming to budget formulation to execution and to performance management.  Sixth, VA is interested in understanding how a small office can effectively leverage services over multiple years to develop and execute a road map of maturation of capability that moves from success to success as techniques and tools mature, and as each resource cycle builds on the successes of previous ones.  Finally, VA expects to serve as a thought leader in the Federal Government in disseminating information and insights about paths to link strategy, performance and budgets, and seeks to know which other organizations are similarly interested.

Future notices will provide updates of the anticipated solicitation release date. <br>  <br> The successful offeror for this acquisition will be required to support the Area Support Group - Kuwait (ASG-KU) for those interconnected base operations support services that are critical to mission accomplishment, and cannot be efficiently acquired independently via separate competitive acquisitions.

Transportation and security will be provided by the Government while conducting tours of each location as well as to and from the tour sites and the Hilton Kuwait Resort.  For security reasons, all participants must use the Government provided transportation.  (NOTE: Although this is the location for pickup and drop-off for site-visit participants, lodging is at the discretion and choice of each party.)   All parties are responsible for transportation to and from the country of Kuwait, entry into Kuwait (securing visa), transportation to and from Kuwait City International Airport (KCIA) and their choice of lodging.   <br> Interested parties should submit the attached Intent to Attend K-BOSSS 2.0 Site Visit form and required supporting documentation to USARMY.RIA.acc.mbx.kbosss2@mail.mil, no later than April 14, 2014. Please reference K-BOSSS 2.0 Site Visit in the subject of your e-mail. <br>  <br> Access to the secure USG facilities is restricted. Information submitted on this form will be used for installation access to secure facilities during the site visit. Failure to submit the Intent to Attend K-BOSSS 2.0 Site Visit form and required supporting documentation will result in forfeiture of the right to attend this site visit. Attendees will be required to present two forms of state-issued identification upon arrival to secure locations. <br>  <br> This site-visit announcement neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) in Portland Oregon intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.302-1, Other than Full and Open Competition procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedure, for the acquisition of services for Steelhead and Chinook Marking and Tagging. Vendor: Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission 205 SE Spokane Street, Suite 100 Portland, Oregon 97202 The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services. The size standard is 14 M.  The Universal Product Code for this procurement is F021.  No solicitation or request for quote is available for this procurement.  Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USFWS requirements described herein may submit a response no later than 03/26/2014, 1200 PS to be considered.  Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail only.  A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.  Any questions or comments should be directed to Josh Gordon via e-mail at josh_gordon@fws.gov. The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) marks and tags more than eight million Chinook salmon and steelhead annually at fish hatcheries in Californias Central Valley Chinook. Marking and tagging are accomplished using sophisticated state-of-the-art patented AutoFish tagging systems, which enable processing of larger numbers of fish and with improved precision as compared to the traditional method of conducting the task manually. PSMFC personnel have specialized technical expertise in the operation of the state-of-the-art AutoFish tagging systems, and no other contractor can provide personnel with the immediate unique technical expertise to operate the Autofish tagging systems. The Autofish tagging systems available for use in California are shared among all of the State and Federally operated hatcheries in the Central Valley, and are the property of the California Department of Fish and Game. Because of the unique expertise required to operate the Autofish tagging systems, the California Department of Fish and game require that PSMFC staff be the only contractor permitted to operate the Autofish systems. Marking/tagging fish using manual techniques is the only alternative to marking/tagging with the automated system, and would result in a significant increase in program cost and decreased precision. Currently, no steps are being pursued to enable full and open competition for subsequent contracts for fish marking and tagging services at the Services Coleman and Livingston Stone National Fish Hatchery Complex because of the special circumstances associated with the ownership and operation of the Autofish tagging systems facility. The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) is an interstate Compact established by Congress in 1947 (Public Law 232, 80th Congress, 61 Stat. 419), and adopted by the State of California (Chapter 1447, 1974). The purposes of the Compact are to promote the better utilization of fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, and to develop a joint program of protection and prevention of physical waste of such fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the compacting States jointly or separately now have or may have jurisdiction. PSMFC is governed by one or more representatives from each state, as determined by state statutes, and is supported by annual funds made available by the member states. One of PSMFCs objectives under the Compact is to facilitate research and management projects relating to interstate fisheries. This includes providing administrative, fiscal and field coordination and support for interstate and State/Federal research and management projects. PSMFC has provided this service to the State of California both in the form of administering federal funds to the State of California and state and local funds from the State of California.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the US Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Enterprise Information Technology Project Management Office (eIT PMO) intends to negotiate a sole source acquisition for SmartDesk software manufactured by Liquent, Inc. <br>  <br> SmartDesk for PDF is a collection of Acrobat  plug-ins that provide specific electronic submission centric functionality above and beyond what is available in the standard Acrobat  application.  SmartDesk for PDF enhances the PDF publishing process for electronic submissions by ensuring that all PDF documents are prepared in compliance with agency requirements. SmartDesk for PDF provides various automated capabilities, which replace manual processes and reduce the overall time and effort required for the PDF publishing process. <br>  <br> Liquent is the only qualified vendor to provide the SmartDesk for PDF software that is designed to ensure efficiencies with the FDA submission process.  Known as the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) product, Liquent's InSight for Publishing and Insight for Viewing software was installed in 2013 by the eIT PMO and is maintained by the eIT PMO.  The software is currently used by USAMMDA and available to the Command.  SmartDesk for PDF is unique because it is the only PDF software that is able to integrate with the Insight for Publishing software used by USAMMDA to prepare submissions to the FDA.   <br>  <br> A RFQ W81XWH-14-T-0141 will be issued for brand name items only. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 511210 and the size standard is $35.5 million. All sources that believe they are eligible to provide these items must respond in writing or respond to the RFQ. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide the items outlined above.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the purchase will be awarded without further remark. All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Mr. James Cheng at james.cheng1.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> Interested concerns must identify their capability in writing to the above e-mail <br> address no later than 4:00 pm ET, April 4, 2013.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services.<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.81 per hour or $152.40 per week or $660.40 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) APPLICABLE TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ONLY - NIGHT DIFFERENTIAL: An employee is<br />entitled to pay for all work performed between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.<br />at the rate of basic pay plus a night pay differential amounting to 10 percent of<br />the rate of basic pay.</p>
<p>3) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MedLog) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Spinal Trays and Needles. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Spinal Trays and Needles products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Spinal Trays and Needles. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Spinal Trays and Needles will be established approximately August 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately September 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Spinal Trays and Needles. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Spinal Trays and Needles.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Spinal Trays and Needles. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $627,736.75. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. The Spinal Trays and Needles products represent fifteen distinct product groupings, of which fourteen are clinically significant. Thirteen of those are requirements for addition to the QSL and account for 84.99% ($533,553.87) of the total volume in sales ($627,736.75). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />Spinal Trays and Needles requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide Cage Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a Cage Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account, will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/..<br />5. Vendor MUST provide the following items. Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to HIS through this contract.<br />Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.<br />No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer. In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Once the SA is signed by the lessor it shall be routed to the Chief of the Fort Worth COE Real Estate Division, or other duly authorized Contracting Officer, for execution.  An executed original copy shall be sent to the Lessor and the Lessor shall then direct the selected contractor to proceed.  Work should never be started before the Lessor receives an executed SA.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-14-Q-200085 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411. The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET "HSCG38-14-Q-200085 - REQUIREMENTS" FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.</p>

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>

The Government reserves the right to make a single award, no award, or multiple awards if after considering the additional administrative costs it is in the Government's best interest to do so. The Government shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation. Individual awards shall be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest cost to the Government including the assumed administrative costs.</p>

<p>USCG ALC<br />1664 Weeksville Road<br />SRR Hangar 75, HSCG38-14-Q-200085<br />Attn: Vincent C. Pitt<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Part 21 of the Federal Aviation Regulation outlines certification procedures.</p>

<p>Past Performance: The Government may use information available from past contracts/purchase orders with the USCG, delivery information found in the USCG's AMMIS system, and any information found using sources such as Federal Government sources, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)/Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Offerors are advised that more recent performance is more relevant than less recent performance and will be given greater weight in the evaluation process. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating.</p>

<DESC>Q: Should Nitrous Dioxide really be Nitrous Oxide? <br />A: Yes, it is "Nitrous Oxide."
<p>Q: Can you provide the specs for the Lung Diffusion gas? There is aprice difference between neon, which some contain, and carbon monoxide,which is in others.<br />A: Nitrogen with 0.3% Carbon Monoxide 0.3% Methane 21% Oxygen Lung Diffusion Certified K Size Steel Cylinder</p>
<p>Q: Do you know if you are currently using 2 different trucks for delivery? 4 bulk tank sizes are listed 11k, 3k, 1500 and 500.<br />A: Praxair only uses 1 delivery truck to fill these bulk<br />liquid oxygen tanks.</p>
<p>Q: The 1500 and the 500 are considered "micro bulk" and in some cases they cannot be filled by the same truck. <br />A: The Incumbent uses the same delivery truck to fill the reserve tanks.<br /><br />Q: The bulk tanks also need to have an emergency reserve that is usually high pressure cylinders so we will need to know if that is part of the bid since it is usually static and doesn't count as part of the yearly usage.<br />A: Back in 2004, Wilford Hall conducted an emergency back-up of oxygen and liquid oxygen due to some repairs of the bulk liquid oxygen tanks. Praxair sent a Portable Oxygen Trailer and connected it to the main bldg. oxygen line to provide continued support to the Operation Rooms. Wilford Hall also obtained 60 oxygen tanks as back up to those areas that do not have oxygen lines in the rooms. This was when Wilford Hall was a full-blown hospital.<br /><br />Q: What is the annual bulk O2 volume? (there were * quantities in the<br />base year of the price schedule does that indicate annual usage)<br />A: Total usage for one year was a volume of 40,449 cubic<br />feet, based on historical data.</p>
<p>Q: Are the bulk tanks customer owned? <br />A: No, the bulk tanks are owned by the incumbent Contractor (Praxair).</p>
<p>Q: It states "Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Tank owned by contractor will not be rented by WHASC." Are you asking that the LOX tank be supplied by the contractor without a rental fee?<br />A: The rental price shall be incorporated in the cubic foot price, or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Q: Where do we provide pricing for the installation of the bulk tank(s).<br />A: You can provide the pricing for the installation in a seperate line item, and it will be incorporated in the new contract.</p>
<p>Q: Delivery Access: Will a tanker truck be able to access the site, free and clear of obstructions?<br />A: Yes, there is access to the sites.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, FA4608-14-Q-S036, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-66 Effective 01 Apr 2013). This procurement is 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $14 Million dollars. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. You will not be eligible to receive an award if you are not in the System for Award Management. (Reference: DFARS 252.204-7004, Alt A Required System for Award Management). The following commercial items are requested in this solicitation.
<p>The items being procured are:</p>
<p>0001 Annual Cathodic Protection Survey; Work shall consist of furnishing all labor, tools, equipment, materials, and transportation necessary to perform a water tank calibration survey of the cathodic protection (CP) systems in four elevated water tanks and five ground level water tanks location on Barksdale AFB, LA. See "Scope of Services" below<br />SCOPE OF SERVICES<br />CATHODIC PROTECTION SURVEYS AND REPAIRS<br />NINE (9) WATER STORAGE TANKS<br />BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE</p>
<p>A. Scope: Work shall consist of furnishing all labor, tools, equipment, materials, and transportation necessary to perform a water tank calibration survey of the cathodic protection (CP) systems in four elevated water tanks and five ground level water tanks located on Barksdale AFB, LA. All tanks are in service and have sufficient water for the operation of the CP systems. Services shall include repairing the CP systems on three of these water tanks to include: <br />Replace rectifier for tank number 1358, recoat the level float, roof, and vent on tank number 5857, and replace cell C-1 on tank number 6800.</p>
<p>Surveys shall be performed IAW MIL-HDBK-1136.</p>
<p>B. Background: Within Barksdale AFB, water is stored within nine (9) tanks for potable and fire protection service. The tanks are constructed of welded or riveted carbon steel. Since the tanks are exposed to the water, they are subject to corrosion. As a primary means of corrosion control, the tanks are internally coated. To supplement the coatings, each tank has been provided with an impressed current cathodic protection system. The cathodic protection systems consist of rectifier units mounted at ground level, suspended anodes and two (2) or more permanent reference cells. A listing of the tanks is as follows:</p>
<p>Elevated No. 1358 130' High 50'f Wet Riser Potable<br />Elevated No. 4490 137' High 50'f Wet Riser Potable<br />Elevated No. 7291 100' High 26'f Wet Riser Potable<br />Elevated No. 7417 125' High 34'f Wet Riser Potable <br />Ground No. 5857 20' High 64'f <br />Ground No. 6800 20' High 40'f<br />Ground No. 7562 40' High 32'f<br />Ground No. 7722 25' High 34'f<br />Ground No. 6208 15' High 20'f</p>
<p>Ground storage tanks No. 5857 and 7722 also have impressed current cathodic protection systems on the underside of the floors. These systems protect the external floor plates from soil side corrosion.</p>
<p>As part of base operations, the impressed current cathodic protection system rectifiers are monitored monthly by base personnel. Annually, the cathodic protection systems are to be inspected and tested IAW MIL-HDBK 1136 to ensure they comply with NACE standards. This request for proposal addresses evaluations of the cathodic protection system on the water tanks as identified. The survey and associated reports are to be completed by 31 October 2014.</p>
<p><br />C. Inspection of Water Tanks:</p>
<p>a. Rectifiers - Record model, make, serial number, tap settings, mode of operation, set potential, current output, voltage output and On/Off potential of each permanent reference cell. If a rectifier unit is inoperable or malfunctioning, conduct troubleshooting to determine the cause. Make minor repairs and adjustments to ensure proper operation where possible. Record any changes in settings, output and operation mode.</p>
<p>b. Condition - Visually observe the condition of the cathodic protection components including the rectifier, conduits, cables, hand hole covers, hangers, reference cells and anodes. Remove at least one (1) anode assembly of each type of array and inspect for cable condition and consumption. Note general condition of exterior and interior coatings on tank. Obtain photographs documenting coating and cathodic protection system conditions.</p>
<p>c. Potential Measurements - Insert a current interrupter in the rectifier negative circuit. Set the interrupter on a cycle of 30 seconds "On" and 2 seconds "Off". Open manholes, hand holes and/or vents to provide at least three (3) points of access to obtain potentials in tank/bowl, and another opening for access to the riser pipe on elevated tanks. The access points on the tank/bowl should be out toward the shell. Using a sealed test cable connection, lower a portable copper/copper-sulfate reference cell to the floor of the tank or bottom of the riser pipe. Use care to judge the bottom of the riser. The portable reference cell must be freshly charged, immediately before starting the survey. Obtain potential measurements utilizing an M. C. Miller Model LC-4 voltmeter or equal. Record "On" and "Instant Off" potentials on 5-foot centers up the shell/riser at each access point. From the manhole, also obtain a profile on 5-foot centers across the floor starting at the center and ending at the shell. The "On" potential to be recorded is the highest negative value observed during the current applied cycle. The "Instant Off" potential to be recorded is the lowest or least negative value displayed during the "Instant Off" cycle. Once the potentials have been obtained secure all covers, remove the interrupters, and return the rectifier to operation. Adjust the control settings as required based on the test results.</p>
<p>d. Safety - The Specialist must use an OSHA approved climbing harness. The base will provide mechanisms to connect to the ladder climbing slide devices. The Specialist must be securely tied off at all times when climbing and testing on the roof. The tie off must include a shock reduction devise. An assistant must provide ground support and safety watch. On the elevated tanks, an approved radio must be used to provide communications between the Specialist and ground support. Elevated tanks shall not be climbed in heavy rain, high winds, or when lightning is nearby. When materials are transported to/from the roof, they must be secured so they do not fall.</p>
<p><br />D. Criteria: The internal and external criteria are an "Instant Off" potential of -850 millivolts or more negative.</p>
<p><br />E. Reports: A report shall be prepared for the Water Tank System inspections. The report shall be of executive summary format, with sections addressing objectives, conclusions, recommendations, descriptions of structures and cathodic protection systems, test procedures and results narrative. Appendices shall include tabulated field data, photographs, material lists, and drawings. Any recommendations for repairs and additions must be supported in the report through a described analysis of the field data. If repairs/additions are recommended, the report must include a scope of work, cost estimates for implementation and material lists.</p>
<p>F. Qualifications: All field tests and reports are to be conducted by a NACE certified Cathodic Protection Specialist. The Specialist must have at least ten (10) years of direct responsibility for the evaluation of water storage tanks on DOD facilities. This experience must include design, troubleshooting and repair of cathodic protection systems, and coating assessments. The Specialist must be supported by at least one (1) person capable of assisting with the field evaluation.</p>
<p>G. Proposal Requirements: Submit a technical proposal including a statement of services that address all aspects of this scope. Issue a resume of the Specialist. Provide a project schedule showing specific days of the week in which specific tanks will be inspected. Provide an itemized fee schedule listing direct labor, overhead, expenses, hours and material costs.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, FA4608-14-Q-S036, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-66 Effective 01 Apr 2013). This procurement is 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $14 Million dollars. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. You will not be eligible to receive an award if you are not in the System for Award Management. (Reference: DFARS 252.204-7004, Alt A Required System for Award Management). The following commercial items are requested in this solicitation.
<p>The items being procured are:</p>
<p>0001 Annual Cathodic Protection Survey; Work shall consist of furnishing all labor, tools, equipment, materials, and transportation necessary to perform a water tank calibration survey of the cathodic protection (CP) systems in four elevated water tanks and five ground level water tanks location on Barksdale AFB, LA. See "Scope of Services" below<br />SCOPE OF SERVICES<br />CATHODIC PROTECTION SURVEYS AND REPAIRS<br />NINE (9) WATER STORAGE TANKS<br />BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE</p>
<p>A. Scope: Work shall consist of furnishing all labor, tools, equipment, materials, and transportation necessary to perform a water tank calibration survey of the cathodic protection (CP) systems in four elevated water tanks and five ground level water tanks located on Barksdale AFB, LA. All tanks are in service and have sufficient water for the operation of the CP systems. Services shall include repairing the CP systems on three of these water tanks to include: <br />Replace rectifier for tank number 1358, recoat the level float, roof, and vent on tank number 5857, and replace cell C-1 on tank number 6800.</p>
<p>Surveys shall be performed IAW MIL-HDBK-1136.</p>
<p>B. Background: Within Barksdale AFB, water is stored within nine (9) tanks for potable and fire protection service. The tanks are constructed of welded or riveted carbon steel. Since the tanks are exposed to the water, they are subject to corrosion. As a primary means of corrosion control, the tanks are internally coated. To supplement the coatings, each tank has been provided with an impressed current cathodic protection system. The cathodic protection systems consist of rectifier units mounted at ground level, suspended anodes and two (2) or more permanent reference cells. A listing of the tanks is as follows:</p>
<p>Elevated No. 1358 130' High 50'f Wet Riser Potable<br />Elevated No. 4490 137' High 50'f Wet Riser Potable<br />Elevated No. 7291 100' High 26'f Wet Riser Potable<br />Elevated No. 7417 125' High 34'f Wet Riser Potable <br />Ground No. 5857 20' High 64'f <br />Ground No. 6800 20' High 40'f<br />Ground No. 7562 40' High 32'f<br />Ground No. 7722 25' High 34'f<br />Ground No. 6208 15' High 20'f</p>
<p>Ground storage tanks No. 5857 and 7722 also have impressed current cathodic protection systems on the underside of the floors. These systems protect the external floor plates from soil side corrosion.</p>
<p>As part of base operations, the impressed current cathodic protection system rectifiers are monitored monthly by base personnel. Annually, the cathodic protection systems are to be inspected and tested IAW MIL-HDBK 1136 to ensure they comply with NACE standards. This request for proposal addresses evaluations of the cathodic protection system on the water tanks as identified. The survey and associated reports are to be completed by 31 October 2014.</p>
<p><br />C. Inspection of Water Tanks:</p>
<p>a. Rectifiers - Record model, make, serial number, tap settings, mode of operation, set potential, current output, voltage output and On/Off potential of each permanent reference cell. If a rectifier unit is inoperable or malfunctioning, conduct troubleshooting to determine the cause. Make minor repairs and adjustments to ensure proper operation where possible. Record any changes in settings, output and operation mode.</p>
<p>b. Condition - Visually observe the condition of the cathodic protection components including the rectifier, conduits, cables, hand hole covers, hangers, reference cells and anodes. Remove at least one (1) anode assembly of each type of array and inspect for cable condition and consumption. Note general condition of exterior and interior coatings on tank. Obtain photographs documenting coating and cathodic protection system conditions.</p>
<p>c. Potential Measurements - Insert a current interrupter in the rectifier negative circuit. Set the interrupter on a cycle of 30 seconds "On" and 2 seconds "Off". Open manholes, hand holes and/or vents to provide at least three (3) points of access to obtain potentials in tank/bowl, and another opening for access to the riser pipe on elevated tanks. The access points on the tank/bowl should be out toward the shell. Using a sealed test cable connection, lower a portable copper/copper-sulfate reference cell to the floor of the tank or bottom of the riser pipe. Use care to judge the bottom of the riser. The portable reference cell must be freshly charged, immediately before starting the survey. Obtain potential measurements utilizing an M. C. Miller Model LC-4 voltmeter or equal. Record "On" and "Instant Off" potentials on 5-foot centers up the shell/riser at each access point. From the manhole, also obtain a profile on 5-foot centers across the floor starting at the center and ending at the shell. The "On" potential to be recorded is the highest negative value observed during the current applied cycle. The "Instant Off" potential to be recorded is the lowest or least negative value displayed during the "Instant Off" cycle. Once the potentials have been obtained secure all covers, remove the interrupters, and return the rectifier to operation. Adjust the control settings as required based on the test results.</p>
<p>d. Safety - The Specialist must use an OSHA approved climbing harness. The base will provide mechanisms to connect to the ladder climbing slide devices. The Specialist must be securely tied off at all times when climbing and testing on the roof. The tie off must include a shock reduction devise. An assistant must provide ground support and safety watch. On the elevated tanks, an approved radio must be used to provide communications between the Specialist and ground support. Elevated tanks shall not be climbed in heavy rain, high winds, or when lightning is nearby. When materials are transported to/from the roof, they must be secured so they do not fall.</p>
<p><br />D. Criteria: The internal and external criteria are an "Instant Off" potential of -850 millivolts or more negative.</p>
<p><br />E. Reports: A report shall be prepared for the Water Tank System inspections. The report shall be of executive summary format, with sections addressing objectives, conclusions, recommendations, descriptions of structures and cathodic protection systems, test procedures and results narrative. Appendices shall include tabulated field data, photographs, material lists, and drawings. Any recommendations for repairs and additions must be supported in the report through a described analysis of the field data. If repairs/additions are recommended, the report must include a scope of work, cost estimates for implementation and material lists.</p>
<p>F. Qualifications: All field tests and reports are to be conducted by a NACE certified Cathodic Protection Specialist. The Specialist must have at least ten (10) years of direct responsibility for the evaluation of water storage tanks on DOD facilities. This experience must include design, troubleshooting and repair of cathodic protection systems, and coating assessments. The Specialist must be supported by at least one (1) person capable of assisting with the field evaluation.</p>
<p>G. Proposal Requirements: Submit a technical proposal including a statement of services that address all aspects of this scope. Issue a resume of the Specialist. Provide a project schedule showing specific days of the week in which specific tanks will be inspected. Provide an itemized fee schedule listing direct labor, overhead, expenses, hours and material costs.</p>

Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or Native as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that:
(i) The combined Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise; (ii) the Indians or Indian Tribes shall, together, receive at least a majority of the earnings from the contract; and (iii) the management and daily business operations of an Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe. To ensure actual control over the enterprise, the individuals must possess requisite management or technical capabilities directly related to the primary industry in which the enterprise conducts business. The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods:
(1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation;
(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.
(b) General.
(1) Under the Buy Indian Act, offers are solicited only from Indian economic enterprises.
(2) BIA will reject all offers received from ineligible enterprises.
(3) Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made to an Indian economic enterprise, as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause.
(c) Required Submissions. In response to this solicitation, an offeror must also provide the following:
(1) A description of the required percentage of the work/costs to be provided by the offeror over the contract term as required by section 1452.280-3, Subcontracting Limitations clause;
(2) A description of the source of human resources for the work to be performed by the offeror;
(3) A description of the method(s) of recruiting and training Indian employees, indicating the extent of soliciting employment of Indian persons, as required by DIAR 1452.226-70, Indian Preference, or DIAR 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program, clause(s);
(4) A description of how subcontractors (if any) will be selected in compliance with the Indian Preference or Indian Preference Program clause(s);
(5) The names, addresses, and descriptions of work to be performed by Indian persons or economic enterprises being considered for subcontracts (if any) and the percentage of the total direct project work/costs they would be performing;
(6) Qualifications of the key personnel (if any) that will be assigned to the contract; and
(7) A description of method(s) for compliance with any supplemental Tribal employment preference requirements, if contained in this solicitation.
(d) Required Assurance. The offeror must provide written assurance to the Indian Affairs that it will comply, or has, complied fully with the requirements of this clause.

(e) Non-responsiveness. Failure to provide the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause may cause Indian Affairs to find an offer non-responsive and to reject it.
(f) Eligibility.
(1) Participation in the Mentor-Protg Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.
(2) If a contractor no longer meets the definition of an Indian economic enterprise after award, the contractor must notify the CO in writing. The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility. Failure to give the CO immediate written notification means that: (i) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible for future contract awards under this part; and (ii) Indian Affairs may consider termination for default if it is in the best interest of the government.
(End of clause)
1452.280-3 Subcontracting limitations.

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. 
HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 Facsimile Number:  (703) 806-8866 or 8875

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIHLM2014039SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to develop and maintain a Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach website to create a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. This acquisition is Full and Open. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Health literacy has become a well-established area of study. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has a health literacy working group that coordinates NLM's work with similar working groups administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) also has an active health literacy interest group among its membership.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed, a one-stop (Internet-based) location, will create an arena where researchers can obtain many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve the methodological quality of health literacy research. The Health Literacy Tool Shed represents a service that provides outreach to health literacy professionals. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to find many of the available constructs and quantitative tools used to measure health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research. Although the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the project is designed to create a needed educational resource.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will organize constructs, measures, and instruments that are currently scattered across an array of health literacy research. There is no current resource where practitioners and researchers can consult what health literacy measurement measures, constructs, and instruments are best suited to a planned project. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information on health literacy assessment instruments, this foundational gap inhibits the field's development as a coherent body of knowledge and practice. The end of methodological fragmentation in the health literacy field (and the availability of a website to find the best instruments for specific projects) also will assist NLM's future health literacy research and help make NLM a leader in health literacy research and practice.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a unique educational resource. While this type of resource often is touted by health literacy researchers and practitioners, currently the proposed educational resource does not exist nor is a similar resource under construction elsewhere.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective</p>
<p>This Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach project creates a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. While the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the current project creates an educational resource that provides outreach to a research community as well as a topic of interest to the NLM.</p>
<p>The project will create a one-stop website, where researchers can assess many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve health literacy research. The proposed Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will provide a vital outreach service for the health literacy research community. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to identify and assess many of the available constructs and quantitative measures used to assess health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research in one, accessible location.</p>
<p>Although dozens of health literacy measurement tools have been introduced and the literature has proliferated, a core problem in health literacy outreach and intervention efforts is the uneven quality of methods used by health literacy assessment teams and a confusing array of constructs, measures, and instruments. Some examples of the current methodological confusion and fragmentation in health literacy research is found in Appendix A, which suggests there are at least fifteen (15) separate measures based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy. Appendix A also notes there are nine different measures based in the Test of Functional Health Literacy (TOFHLA) as well as many other constructs and measures of aspects of health literacy.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread availability of health literacy measurement tools, criticisms from independent reviewers reflect that health literacy research methodological flaws may stem from a lack of infrastructure to support health literacy researchers and practitioners. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information about health literacy assessment constructs, measures, and instruments, the gap impedes the health literacy field's development into a more coherent body of knowledge and practice. <br /><br />The Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will create for the first time: 1) access to health literacy assessment tools; 2) a health literacy tool selection process for investigators; 3) an overview of researcher adherence to various health literacy instruments; and, 4) background information about a construct/measure's validity or empirical validation.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a virtual indexing system for health literacy methods with specific information on the following:</p>
<p>&#9679;Administration instructions (how long it takes to administer, number of questions, languages, method of administration, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679;Constructs measured (i.e. numeracy, word pronunciation, problem solving, general health maintenance, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679;Links to the instruments (or information on how to obtain the instrument when the Contractor has not secured permission to post the instrument) and to validation articles</p>
<p>&#9679;Expert commentary on strengths and limitations and on how to select instruments in various research and practice contexts.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed also could identify some gaps in the current array of health literacy instruments and provide a venue for users to discuss the development of further health literacy research assessment tools. In addition, the Health Literacy Tool Shed provides an excellent complement to NLM's Consumer Health Informatics Research Resource (chirr.nlm.nih.gov), which provides general information about common constructs used in consumer health informatics assessment, including health literacy.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria</p>
<p>1)The Contractor must possess extensive academic knowledge and expertise in the field of health literacy research and extensive experience in health literacy practice in both health care delivery and public health.<br />2)The Contractor must display a track record of national and international leadership in evaluating health literacy research.<br />3)The Contractor's subject matter experts (health literacy researchers and practitioners) must possess a Ph.D. or M.D. degree and publish regularly in a refereed academic journal.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services needed to complete this project. All work performed under this procurement shall be monitored by the NLM Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (Apr 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (Apr 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THE RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.<br /><br />This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.</p>
<p>1. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose:</span></strong> The purpose of this RFI is to gather comments and identify potential sources, materials, timeframe, and approximate costs to test, produce and implement anti-skid on 507 T-38 aircraft to increase braking capability. This is not to redesign the entire braking system, but to add anti-skid capability with minimal modification to the existing system.</p>
<p>2. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong> The T-38 System Program Office (SPO) requires an industry response regarding innovative or diverse technology to optimize the design for the braking system/landing gear. The current braking system lacks anti-skid braking capability. The T-38 is the only aircraft in the fleet without anti-skid, and has resulted in the loss of seven aircraft and two pilot fatalities. Numerous attempts have been made to evaluate existing materials and add anti-skid to the T-38. However, all attempts have been cancelled. The T-38 is still in need of improved stopping performance to increase safety during rollouts and rejected takeoffs. The T-38 program office is seeking cost-effective solutions to the issue.</p>
<p>3. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Task:</span></strong> <br /><br />&bull; Develop a new state of the art technology that will add an anti-skid capability to the T-38 while making minimal modifications to the existing landing gear system, hydraulics, valves, fluids, electronics, software, adapters, etc.<br />&bull; Anti-skid addition should match or improve stopping distance performance under every reasonable operating condition (wet/dry runway, heavy/light aircraft, etc.)<br />&bull; Anti-skid addition should not decrease current reliability/maintainability<br />&bull; Add no more than 25 lbs. in additional weight.<br />&bull; Materials must be manufactured in accordance with aviation industry standards, design specifications, requirements, and tolerances. <br />&bull; The contractor's response to the RFI should include estimates of increased performance <br />&bull; The contractors response should include proper schedule estimates, non-recurring costs, cost per unit, and costs to retrofit 507 A/C</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Information/Format:</strong></span> Potential offerors willing to become qualified source must be able to submit a Source Approval Request (SAR). Potential offerors shall provide information on relevant performance history and/or evidence of capability to satisfy this type of requirement, to include the NSN or PN (if existent). Potential offerors will demonstrate the offeror's infrastructure and integration capability to provide all aspects of this task to include but not limited to the following:<br /><br />&bull; Manufacturing aircraft components, specifically aircraft anti-skid<br />&bull; Previous government projects/qualification/approval/contract by similarity<br />&bull; Other pertinent data concerning your qualification to manufacture the required item.</p>
<p>Please submit electronically your response in an executive summary format not to exceed 10 pages. If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information.</p>
<p>Final vendor RFI responses are due by close of business 21 April 2014.</p>
<p>The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>
<p>For questions, comments or RFI response, please contact:</p>

The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 50 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 150 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Product improvements, integrations, and testing.   <br/><br/>III.    Training, overhaul, depot-level, field maintenance support, recapitalization/reset of CROWS, and general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification includes the performance requirements and technical drawings.  The detail specification states the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and how the components are to be fabricated or constructed.  The detail specification does not include technical drawings and assembly procedures for some sub-assemblies, which are to be made by qualified directed sources at least until the First Article Testing phase.  This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between the new CROWS producer and commonality/interchangeability with existing CROWS systems.  The U.S. Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation: <br/> <br/> - Detail Specification<br/> - Performance requirements<br/> - Technical Drawings<br/> - Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/> - Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/> - Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/> - Assembly procedures<br/> - List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/> - Quality requirements <br/> - Test requirements<br/> - Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be released nor will prospective contractors have access to it at any time. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the U.S. Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be addressed through a software change process between the U.S. Government and the prospective Contractor. <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be provided upon request after the Request for Proposals release provided that all prerequisite paper work (described below) is properly completed, submitted, and approved.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement<br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  All other foreign companies shall be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) requirements.  The countries of Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway are exempt from ITAR restrictions in accordance with 22 CFR 125.4(c) for the Pre-Solicitation Conference and solicitation; however these countries shall be ITAR compliant before a contract award.  This exemption will terminate on 25 August 2012.  All other countries shall obtain the appropriate licenses from the Department of State directly.

Please reference the following link consulting these regulations http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />RFP-PCC-0022<br />CAR XV</p>
<p>NOTE: This pre-solicitation notice has been revised.&nbsp;<br /><br />Description:</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has two requirements for the management and operation of a contractor-owned/contractor-leased, contractor-operated correctional facility. Each requirement must be able to operate a facility that has an inmate population that will fall within the range of a minimum of 1,500 to a maximum 2,000 at the 115% level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The population will be low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.<br /><br />An offeror may submit for only one requirement or both requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement A<br /></strong>Proposed institutions shall house inmates in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. The proposed facility must be located in one of the following states: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey or New York. This requirement must be able to operate a facility that has an inmate population that will fall within the range of a minimum of 1,500 to a maximum 2,000 at the 115% level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The population will be low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.<br /><br />An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 150 days after contract award, or no later than April 1, 2016, at a rate specified in the resulting contract. Any construction, expansion, or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the solicitation/contract. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Requirement B<br /></strong>Proposed institutions shall house inmates in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. The proposed facility may be located anywhere in the continental United States. This requirement must be able to operate a facility that has an inmate population that will fall within the range of a minimum of 1,500 to a maximum 2,000 at the 115% level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The population will be low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.<br /><br />An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 150 days after contract award, or no later than April 1, 2016, at a rate specified in the resulting contract. Any construction, expansion, or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the solicitation/contract. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Both Requirements<br /></strong>The BOP intends to award a Performance-based, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity type contract. The Government will be required to order and the contractor required to furnish at least the established minimum quantity of 90% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. Additionally, the contractor will be required to house a daily population of up to 15% over the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The contract award will have a potential term of 10 years, consisting of one four-year base period and three (3) two-year option periods. Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based work statement based on American Correctional Association Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions.</p>
<p>Offerors are prohibited from housing non-Department of Justice (DOJ) inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines are acceptable. Services received from or provided to the resulting contract shall not be shared with other non-DOJ contractual obligations.</p>
<p>The BOP population must remain separate from other populations at all times. All proposals offering shared services will be evaluated to determine the soundness and effectiveness of the approach to managing and operating the shared institution and/or services.<br /><br />Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located. Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of the proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).&nbsp; A NEPA analysis will be performed for each proposed contract action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An Environmental Assessment will be required prior to award for both Requirement A and B. The offeror's proposal cannot contain any proposal or action that could, in the sole opinion of the Bureau of Prisons, significantly impact the quality of the human environment as determined by either: (1) a consideration of the offeror's proposal under the National Environmental Policy Act; or (2) lack of said consideration due to the failure of the offeror's proposal to contain sufficient information for the Bureau to conduct a complete analysis<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any proposal under Requirements A or B that, in the sole opinion of the Bureau of Prisons, would necessitate an Environmental Impact Analysis will not be considered for award.<br /><br />The Bureau of Prisons intends for performance to begin on either Requirement A or Requirement B no later than 06/01/2015.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith-based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.

<DESC><strong><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 0001:</span><br />Amendment 0001 to Big Data RFI from NOAA (ST-1330-14-RP-0039) hereby extends the due date for written comments in response to the RFI from March 24, 2014 to March 31, 2014. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">BIG DATA RFI FROM NOAA</span></strong><br />This is a request for information (RFI) only, and is not a solicitation for a contract or grant award. This RFI notice is for information purposes only, is not a request for proposals, and does not obligate the government in any way. The Government will not reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request. The Government will treat each submission as confidential.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong><br />The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is requesting information from industry and other organizations (e.g., non-profits, research laboratories, and universities) to determine whether capability and interest exists for establishing partnerships with NOAA for the purpose of intelligently positioning NOAA's vast data holdings in the cloud, to be co-located with easy and affordable access to computing, storage, and advanced analytical capabilities. NOAA anticipates these partnerships will have the ability to rapidly scale and surge; thus, removing government infrastructure as a bottleneck to the pace of American innovation and enabling new value-added services and unimaginable integration into our daily lives.</p>
<p>Only a small percentage of NOAA's data is posted on public servers and web sites. In many cases these data are hosted to multiple public servers, which may not use the same standard services and formats. Therefore, it is difficult to find and integrate data from these sources for cross-domain analysis and decision-making. Furthermore, NOAA's large data volumes require users to have substantial network, storage, and computing capabilities of their own in order to interact with and exploit the value of this data. NOAA is exploring opportunities to unleash the potential of its environmental data through alternative approaches to strategically position this data with analytic and computational capabilities.</p>
<p>A vibrant private sector participating in the development and delivery of weather; water; and climate data, products, and services to the public is of value to the U.S. economy and environmental awareness. Through expanded partnerships with private sector and other enterprise partners, the potential exists to develop and market enhanced products and services to the Nation. NOAA is looking for partners to incite creative uses and innovative approaches that will tap the full potential of its data, spur economic growth, help more entrepreneurs launch businesses, and to create new jobs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose of this Request for Information (RFI)</span></strong><br />This RFI is intended to inform NOAA on the current status of industry sources, business practices, technical capacity, and operational capability. Furthermore, this RFI is intended to inform NOAA on the feasibility of partnering with one or more industry partners using no-cost agreements. These partners would be responsible for funding all costs related to the movement of data to the cloud as well as their own technology infrastructure, data management, data services, data security, and free data access to users. While this mode of delivery protects NOAA from the cost of provisioning additional infrastructure, it will require careful thought and controls to ensure NOAA's existing services are not impacted and NOAA remains compliant with statutory regulations. This mode of delivery should also provide the appropriate documentation and attribution of NOAA data. NOAA does not intend to use these partnerships as a replacement for existing services. NOAA will remain responsible for retaining and maintaining the scientific stewardship of any data provided to industry partners. The expectation is that all NOAA data moved to the cloud would remain free to the public in its original, unaltered form, but this model will enable the private sector to establish and perhaps charge for new value-added services and products. A proposed solution must also enable NOAA compliance with Presidential Executive Order: &lsquo;Making Open and Machine Readable Data the New Default for Government Information'. "As one vital benefit of open government, making information resources easy to find, accessible, and usable can fuel entrepreneurship, innovation, and scientific discovery that improves Americans' lives and contributes significantly to job creation."</p>
<p>NOAA is providing all industry stakeholders an opportunity to comment and respond. NOAA encourages communication and a robust dialogue on this RFI.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Requested</span></strong><br />Interested firms should submit a response with a written statement of interest or capability and discussion of the following enumerated points:</p>
<p><strong>1. Value Proposition</strong><br />Including consideration of NOAA's responsibilities by virtue of Executive Order 13642 and OMB M-13-13:<br /><br />http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-05-14/pdf/2013-11533.pdf<br />http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf<br /><br />a. Describe your vision of potential innovations, products, or opportunities that may become viable if NOAA releases its environmental data in a strategic location that has both analytic and computational capabilities.<br />b. Describe how sharing NOAA's data could create jobs or spur the economy.<br />c. Provide metrics that should be considered to measure the level of impact or success from releasing this data through this partnership approach.</p>
<p><strong>2. Data Infrastructure</strong><br />a. Provide architectural information and diagrams representing the intended role for any described capability (e.g., data storage, data ingest, data processing, analytics)<br />b. Describe a viable methodology for extracting environmental data from NOAA's access locations, distributed across its enterprise in multiple geographic locations.<br />c. Once the data are collected, describe how these data might be hosted in your environment and how it would be accessible to the public and users of your services.<br />d. Describe your methods for ingesting data from source systems and open sources, automatic application of metadata and other tags, and delivery to analysts and users in "near real time".<br />e. Describe the methods your organization could use to support user capacity and experience (look and feel) such as uptime guarantees, simultaneous user capability (e.g., crash-free user load capacity limits), download bandwidth, and computational capacity (including diverse computational architectures).<br />f. Describe any data transfer, storage, or hosting limitations that should be considered.<br />g. Identify the underlying open source technology and/or standard(s) or other standards (such as ISO, IEEE, industry) to which each capability or product adheres (including data and metadata standards).</p>
<p><strong>3. Data Services</strong><br />a. Identify any catalog or description that NOAA would need to provide along with the data.<br />b. Identify any NOAA data or datasets which you believe would be of highest value to initiate this partnership.<br />c. Describe 1) relevant geospatial and other analytic technical capabilities that help data scientists and untrained end users alike identify patterns, trends, and data segments of interest in the context of dynamic and continuous correlation; 2) capabilities that inherently manage information relationships and models; and 3) agile analytics capabilities that can help data scientists and/or end users identify and dynamically exploit emerging trends in data sets and data flows.<br />d. Describe 1) relevant visual capabilities for helping users understand important relationships in large data sets (e.g., geospatial, graphs, time series, etc.); 2) information access in mobile environments; and 3) capabilities that enable information sharing through visual depictions of large/complex information.<br />e. Describe potential data services or any value-added data services and products.<br />f. Describe the methodology that you might use to determine the price paid by users for value-added services and products.</p>
<p><strong>4. Data Management</strong><br />a. Describe your methodology to ensure data integrity with the "reference copy" that will be retained within NOAA.<br />b. Describe data provenance methods that could to be used to determine attribution and guarantee the reliability of the data.<br />c. Describe how your organization would transition the data to another provider, if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>5. Data Security</strong><br />a. Identify methods that are available in your solution for hardening the capability and/or security features that are intrinsic to your capability to meet FISMA security standards.</p>
<p><strong>6. Partnership Methods</strong><br />a. Describe any acquisition or partnering methodology that you recommend.<br />b.

<DESC>Amendment 0003 of subject Pre-Solicitation Notice #P14PS00489 is issued to include the following information regarding FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting (DEC 1996) into this Pre-Solicitation Notice.
In reference to FAR Clause 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting - The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 has passed and amended the Small Business Act to provide that, for purposes of the limitations on subcontracting, costs incurred by a small business prime contractor on its "similarly situated" small business subcontractor shall not be considered subcontracted costs....
SIMILARLY SITUATED ENTITY - The term "similarly situated entity" means a subcontractor that --- (a) if a subcontractor for a small business concern, is a small business concern; (b) if a subcontractor for a small business conceern eligible to receive contracts under section 8(a), is such a concern; (c) if a subcontractor for a small business concern owned and controlled by women (as defined in section 8(m)) , is such a concern; (d) if a subcontractor for a small business concern owned and controlled by women (as defined in section 8(m)) that is not less than 51 percent owned by 1 or more women who are economically disadvantaged (and such ownership is determined without regard to any community property law), is such a concern; (e) if a subcontractor for a qualified HubZone small business concern, is such a concern; or (f) if a subcontractor for a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, is such a concern.
The National Defense Authorization Act of 2013 permits prime contractors to meet the requirements of the limitations on subcontracting clause by including work performed by similarly situated subcontractors. The FARs limitations on subcontracting clause allows the prime contractor to count small business subcontractors toward the primes own performance requirement.
THE DUE DATE/TIME FOR SUBMISSION OF QUALIFICATIONS IS EXTENDED TO:  5:00PM MT on April 4, 2014.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice for Bridging Design Build Contract
<p>Mary E. Switzer Building - Health and Human Services Consolidation</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to award a firm-fixed price Bridging Design-Build contract for all design and construction services necessary to consolidate five staff divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services at the Mary E. Switzer Building (DC0033ZZ) located at 330 C Street SW, Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Project Scope: This contract will include, but not be limited to, the preparation of design documents to implement improvements for an eight (8) story building with basement pursuant to the approved (by Health and Human Services) concept plans and program of requirements, including Historic Preservation. The Contractor will prepare a complete set of construction documents including architectural, mechanical, electrical, HVAC and the modification to existing life safety systems. Upon approval of the construction documents, the contractor shall furnish and install all mechanical, electrical, HVAC, and life safety systems, as required. The coordination with the Owner's contracted forces and procurements (i.e. IT, Painting, Furniture and Furnishing) is an integral part of the services to be provided. The estimated design and construction cost of this project is in the $10 million to $14 million dollar range.</p>
<p>Procurement Strategy: The selection process will utilize a two phase selection process in accordance with FAR 36.3 and source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.3 negotiated procurement with tradeoff procedures. Stage I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), shall result in a short list of offerors who will be invited to participate in Stage II of the procurement. Stage II, Request for Price Proposals (RFP), shall result in the selection of the construction contractor whose offer provides the best value to the Government. In Stage I, the Government shall identify technical evaluation factors, other than cost or price, that are critical to this procurement and that will serve as the basis for the determination of the short list. When combined, all evaluation factors, other than cost or price, are approximately equal to  price. Interested offerors will be required to submit their Stage I responses by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria established in the RFQ. The Government will then notify each offeror in writing of whether or not it will be invited to participate in the RFP based on the Stage I information submitted. In Stage II, the Government will issue the RFP, including the Bridging Documents, to the short listed offerors from Stage I. The RFP will serve as the basis for the firm-fixed price offers. All offers must be submitted by the date established in the RFP. Based on the Stage I and Stage II submissions, the Government will select the offer that reflects the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make an award based upon evaluation of Stage I and Stage II submissions without discussions.<br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about December 1, 2013, on the Internet at: htt://www/fedbizopps.gov/. This opportunity will be open to both large and small business firms. The firm (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7, as part of its proposal. &nbsp;Consideration is open to established, qualified firms, which currently have active, properly staffed offices within the continental United States (including subcontractors).</span></p>

<p>&bull; One item to put into conference bags</p>
<p>Below is the descriptions and associated costs for all items referenced above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One item of note, NYLC has invited CEO Wendy Spencer, CNCS to provide a keynote address. <br /><br />5. List the proposed contractor (name, contact, and phone number) and describe the unique knowledge or capabilities of the proposed contractor:</p>
<p>The National Service-Learning Conference is the largest gathering of youth and practitioners from the service-learning movement, convening approximately 2,200 young people and adult service-learning practitioners from across the country and around the globe. Three days of workshops, plenary presentations, thought leader series, affinity meetings, exhibits, service projects, and more offer attendees opportunities to refresh and renew their service-learning practice or be introduced to the essentials. The conference is convened by the National Youth Leadership Council. The conference contact is Amy Meuers, (651) 999-7363, ameurs@nylc.org. <br /><br />6. Describe your market research efforts and efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:<br /><br />There are no other service-learning conferences that are national in scope and convene youth, practitioners, and researchers, from all levels of the education sector. There are other conferences that reach specific audiences in service-learning, but do not have the broad reach of the National Service-Learning Conference. Examples include:</p>
<p>The International Association for Research on Service-Learning and Civic Engagement (IARSLCE) Annual Conference<br />The conference will take place November 6th-8th, 2013 in Omaha, NE. IARSLCE supports the process of discovery by assembling school practitioners, funders, and students to share and discuss their research related to service-learning and community engagement. http://www.researchslce.org/conferences/</p>
<p><br />American Education Research Association<br />AERA hosts a special interest group (SIG) on service-learning and experiential learning. The SIG's purpose is "to bring together both researchers and practitioners to build and promote understanding of SL and experiential education for the betterment of the field." The SIG also sponsors presentations on service-learning at the AERA's annual conference. http://www.aera.net/</p>
<p>Conference of the Engagement Scholarship Consortium<br />The Engagement Scholarship Consortium (ESC) is a non-profit educational organization composed of higher education member institutions that work collaboratively to promote strong university-community partnerships anchored in the rigor of scholarship, and designed to help build community capacity. This year's conference will take place October 8th-9th, 2013 at Texas Tech University. http://engagementscholarship.org/conference/esc-2013-meeting</p>
<p>The Engaged Campus: Driving Innovation through Partnerships<br />This conference will showcase and celebrate advanced and innovative efforts in campus civic engagement including experimentation with creative partnerships and a focus on holistic practice-collective, strategic and aligned institutional involvement in local communities. The conference will take place May 19th-21st in Dearborn, MI. http://www.compact.org/events/the-engaged-campus-driving-innovation-through-partnerships/</p>
<p>International Conference on Advances in Service-Learning Research <br />This international research conference is sponsored by more than twenty national organizations and foundations and convenes leading service-learning scholars and researchers to present new study findings, methodological and theoretical advances, and recently completed research agendas for studying various aspects of service-learning in K-12 education, teacher education, and higher education. http://outreach.msu.edu/</p>
<p>7. State why you feel that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>The cost to the government is fair and reasonable because the National Service-Learning Conference is the largest gathering of service-learning practitioners and youth. CNCS will connect with key audiences that naturally fit with our agency's programming. This year's cost is $1,000 less than last year's.</p>
<p>8. Other: N/A</p>
<p><br />9. Certifications: N/A</p>
<p>I hereby certify that the data provided above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

This Pre-Solicitation notice is to provide notification of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intent to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Thedacare Center for Healthcare Value, Inc. The proposed agreement may be negotiated without full and open competition pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Competition is restricted to only one source due to exclusive service by Thedacare Center for Healthcare Value, Inc. ThedaCare is the largest healthcare provider and employer in Northeast Wisconsin with more than 5,400 employees at 43 sites, serving more than 250,000 unique patients in a 14-county area.  The community health system includes: four hospitals; a physician group practice of more than 120 physicians at 21 outpatient sites in the service area; a community senior living center; a behavioral health center; and several residential living communities. 

The ThedaCare program uniquely addresses the educational goal of providing an educational experience focused on quality improvement and systems redesign, and will provide the same training that has been utilized in the past by VISN 21 to build on the work during the past 2 years in VISN 21 medical centers for the new Medical Center Directors and other senior level new staff.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.     No solicitation document exists and this office will not accept telephone inquiries.

<DESC>The PGIP assists the Government of Georgia (GOG) with strategic investments in the gas and power infrastructure to enhance Georgia's energy security.  The project supports the operations of Georgian State Electrosystems (GSE), the Georgian Oil and Gas Corporation (GOGC), and provides oversight for design and implementation through an architect and engineer task order with Tetra Tech.
<p>The base PGIP Activity includes the following three components:</p>
<p>&bull;	Component 1: electricity transmission component<br />&bull;	Component 2: gas transit infrastructure construction and rehabilitation component<br />&bull;	Component 3: infrastructure oversight and capacity building component</p>
<p>The additional funding for the Component 3 - PGIP Oversight activity, in the amount of $820,000, will allow adequate oversight of the electricity transmission and gas transit infrastructure components.  Construction of these components is anticipated to be completed on or around September 30, 2014.  There will be no new activities to the SOW already approved under this IQC.  The extension will allow for oversight of the clean-up and close-out following end of construction.  This is included in the already-approved Scope of Work as "Comprehensive construction oversight" and "Acceptance of constructed facilities and delivered goods."</p>
