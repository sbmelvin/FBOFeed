<DESC>This amendment/modification is issued to provide questions and answers: (Q)1.  Style:  What specific style is the customer requesting, and can the customer provide a picture of what they are looking for?  Fully upholstered modern and contemporary design…does this mean sleek tapered arm with, a knifed edged soft back cushion that is attached but feels and looks loose with clean lines and a soft seat? (That would be my interpretation)    (A):  Clean lines, simple, smooth, clean geometric shape.  Uncluttered (no curves or decoration), exposed legs, no skirt, trim, or fringe.  Basic, bare, and structural.  Pictures attached are an example of what we are looking for, but proposals are not limited to just the design in the picture.  Proposals for equal or better designs may be submitted.  We will review and consider ALL offers. (Q)2.  Fabric:  Is there any direction with Fabric that would help narrow this down.  Fabrics that fit your specifications can range from $4 per yard to over $100 per yard.  In the past the customer had been looking at a fabric that is around $40 per yard.  Is it possible to get a specific $ range ($15-$20 or $40-$45 per yard) or fabric name that we would use to level the playing field.  With out any clarification, the fabric that would; be bid will be difficult to competitively evaluate, and will greatly limit the customers final selections.    (A):  The intent of this solicitation is to receive the best product that would hold up to excessive use in multiple households over an undetermined amount of years.  Please provide a quote on fabric you feel would be most durable, replaceable, and provide the best protection against water/liquid spills.  We will review and consider ALL offers.  (Q)3.  Warranty:  With a minimum 20 year warranty on the Foam, including the seat foam, is there a minimum density that should be used on the seat foam?  (Ex. Through years of testing a 1.8lb sq/inch seat foam does not hold up beyond 7 years, while a 2.2lb sq/inch seat foam is warranted from the foam manufacture for life, and exceeds the 20 year minimum warranty.)   (A):  The intent of this solicitation is to receive the best product that would hold up to excessive use in multiple households over an undetermined amount of years.  The 20 year warranty requested is DESIRED but NOT MANDATORY.  Please state your warranty period, exclusions and conditions when submitting your offer.  We will review and consider ALL offers. (Q)4.  Construction to withstand extreme tropical temperatures in storage.  To us as furniture manufactures, this requirement would suggest that solid wood frames that are doweled and glued are not acceptable.  Where a furniture grade engineered paneling (high quality plywood – that does not warp) with interlocking framing technique would be requested.  Is this correct? And because of the environmental conditions, would thinner wood in some areas and thicker wood in main areas be acceptable?  And is there a minimum thickness of wood that would be acceptable through out the construction such as 7/8inches or 3/4inches?    (A):  The intent of this solicitation is to receive a product that holds up in extreme hot, humid, tropical weather.  Please state the specifications of the product you are offering that you feel meets this requirement.  We will review and consider ALL offers. (Q)5.  Do you have certain brand name seating in mind for this request? I have never seen furniture with a 20 Yr Warranty, and am wondering what type of seating would carry such a warranty, and how we could meet those conditions. (A):  The intent of this solicitation is to receive the best product that would hold up to excessive use in multiple households over an undetermined amount of years.  The 20 year warranty requested is DESIRED but NOT MANDATORY.  Please state your warranty period, exclusions and conditions when submitting your offer.  We will review and consider ALL offers.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ?INFLUENZA IMMUNITY TEST (IIT).  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contemplates multiple award of contracts which would lead to the development/manufacture of a high through-put automated assay, or a rapid test that could determine a person?s immune status to an influenza virus based on the virus? HA subtype. These tests could be useful for confirming an influenza infection in patients who have recovered or in those who had mild or asymptomatic influenza, in particular with a novel influenza subtype.  These tests might also be used during a pandemic in clinical or non-clinical settings to assist in managing vaccine administration and antiviral prophylaxis for workers in selected settings, such as healthcare facilities or critical infrastructure.  A high through-put assay that quantitatively assesses neutralizing antibody, or a marker determined to be equivalent, could also be useful for evaluating candidate vaccines and therapies.

Interested offerors are requested to submit capability statements, including your organization?s technical qualifications to perform this work and your organization?s business size status based on the specified NAICS.  Please submit your response to Bonnie Kennedy, CDC Procurement and Grants Office, via e-mail at bskennedy@cdc.gov no later than 21 September 2007.
