<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS Code is  with a size standard of $6.0 M. The Department of Health and Human Services seeks to acquire ?2009 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey Formation and Design? services utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.500, 12.603, and 12.602. The overarching objective of the 2009 NBCUS is to produce reliable and accurate estimates of national and regional collections, utilization, and safety of all blood products?red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, plasma based pharmaceutical products, and platelets along with tissue and stem cell products from peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow origins.  Such estimates require that the data being reported by the NBCUS institutions be weighted.  Weighting inflates sample totals and adjusts for over- and under-representation of relevant institution characteristics in the sample compared with the population of all institutions.   New to the most recent 2007 NBCUS was the desire to specifically identify and collect baseline data to support efforts towards a real-time bio-vigilance safety monitoring system.  The 2009 NBCUS will further this groundwork with significant stakeholder involvement in the design and pre-analytical phase of the survey.  This contract will provide HHS with all of the required work involved with preparing the survey instrument, including facility (participant) identification, stakeholder conferences, analytical weighting, and survey design. The specific key objectives are: a) Identify, solicit, convene, and foster relevant stakeholder participation in the identification and approval of survey data elements; b) Design and produce appropriate paper-based compartmentalized survey instrument ; and c) Identify appropriate participant facilities and select sample with appropriate weighting algorithms. See the attached solicitation document RFP 07T027002 accompanying this synopsis for further details regarding the requirement and instructions to Offerors. In accordance with RFP section L.2.1., All questions must be submitted in writing via email to Jonathan Hamlet at jonathan.hamlet@psc.gov by 12:00 PM EASTERN TIME Wednesday, August, 1, 2007. In accordance with RFP section L.2.2. all proposals must be submitted via electronic copy and hard copy to the addresses and locations cited in the section by 4:00 PM EASTERN TIME, Monday, August 13, 2007.

The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design and "green" building systems.  Firms shall validate their sustainable abilities and practices through completed LEED certified construction projects and green building awards and have LEED certified professionals on staff as part of the team. EXECUTIVE ORDERS , LAWS, REGULATIONS  Executive Order (EO) 12770 - "Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs" - In accordance with EO 12770 and Public Law 100-418, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement. EO 13423 - "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management" - In accordance with EO 13423 and the Federal Register's "Energy Conservation Standards for New Federal Commercial and Multi-Family High-Rise Residential Buildings and New Federal Low-Rise Residential Buildings", as of January 03, 2007 and January 24, 2007 respectively, work under this contract will be subject to the applicable requirements of these regulations.

Further information on National Park Service governing laws and policies, standards, definitions, practices and guidelines can be found at - http://workflow.den.nps.gov/staging/6_Design/design_bid_build.htm. COORDINATION The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years and  involve projects at various stages of completion, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State and local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes, policies, and permitting processes.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the NPS occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  All task orders will be issued to the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.  The NPS does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1.	Demonstrated experience with integrated design, with an emphasis on project management of coordinated multidisciplinary teams, establishment of up-front environmental and sustainable goals, whole systems approach and follow-through. Ability of the team to communicate, coordinate, and facilitate work expeditiously with the NPS, to participate in related meetings and readily integrate into a multi-disciplinary design team, considering the primary geographic area of work. Emphasis will be placed on the team's prior work experience, and customer service as a team on previous projects, and ability to work with multiple entities including Federal, State, and local agencies and other involved concerns. 2.	Demonstration of a sustainable design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable design solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to local natural and cultural resources and the global environment, as well as aesthetic considerations appropriate for National Park settings. Demonstration of a preservation design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable treatment solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to character-defining features, historic fabric and historic scene, and adherence to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. Demonstrated understanding of the four categories of ultimate historic structure treatments: Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration, and Reconstruction. 3.	 Demonstrated ability, experience and technical competence in the type of work required under this contract,  (i.e., knowledge of indigenous cultures and practices, vernacular architectural styles, historical design and construction methods, sustainable design, natural resources processes and sensitivities, Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), cost estimating, etc.) in various climatic regions for the geographic area covered by this solicitation. Capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs. 4.	Demonstration of the quality and effectiveness of the firm's work and quality review and assurance procedures.  Include examples of Quality Control process records demonstrating effectiveness of firm's procedures. 5.

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design and "green" building systems.  Firms shall validate their sustainable abilities and practices through completed LEED certified construction projects and green building awards and have LEED certified professionals on staff as part of the team. EXECUTIVE ORDERS , LAWS, REGULATIONS  Executive Order (EO) 12770 - "Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs" - In accordance with EO 12770 and Public Law 100-418, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement. EO 13423 - "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management" - In accordance with EO 13423 and the Federal Register's "Energy Conservation Standards for New Federal Commercial and Multi-Family High-Rise Residential Buildings and New Federal Low-Rise Residential Buildings", as of January 03, 2007 and January 24, 2007 respectively, work under this contract will be subject to the applicable requirements of these regulations. PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily: A)	Pre-Design Services:  "	Programming (Site Analysis, Site Program, and Architectural Program) "	Contextual Analysis B)	Supplementary Services   C)	Design Services: "	Schematic Design "	Value Analysis and Value-based decision making "	Design Development "	Construction Documents "	Construction Support D)	Compliance Services: "	Research "	Inventory, Resource Surveys, Wetland Delineations "	Historic Structure and Cultural Landscape Reports and Assessments "	NEPA Compliance "	Section106 and NHPA Compliance "	Other Environmental Compliance (i.e. fish habitat assessments, biological assessments, statement of findings for floodplains and wetlands, coastal zone management consistency determinations) E)	Cost Estimating, including Life Cycle Costing and Total Cost of Ownership F)	Permitting G)	Construction Management H)	Project Scheduling I)	Risk Analysis A documented internal Quality Control program shall be applied to all services performed.  Further information on National Park Service governing laws and policies, standards, definitions, practices and guidelines can be found at - http://workflow.den.nps.gov/staging/6_Design/design_bid_build.htm. COORDINATION The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years and  involve projects at various stages of completion, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State and local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes, policies, and permitting processes.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the NPS occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor. All task orders will be issued to the prime contractor. Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.  The NPS does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1.	Demonstrated experience with integrated design, with an emphasis on project management of coordinated multidisciplinary teams, establishment of up-front environmental and sustainable goals, whole systems approach and follow-through. Ability of the team to communicate, coordinate, and facilitate work expeditiously with the NPS, to participate in related meetings and readily integrate into a multi-disciplinary design team, considering the primary geographic area of work. Emphasis will be placed on the team's prior work experience, and customer service as a team on previous projects, and ability to work with multiple entities including Federal, State, and local agencies and other involved concerns. 2.	Demonstration of a sustainable design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable design solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to local natural and cultural resources and the global environment, as well as aesthetic considerations appropriate for National Park settings. Demonstration of a preservation design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable treatment solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to character-defining features, historic fabric and historic scene, and adherence to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. Demonstrated understanding of the four categories of ultimate historic structure treatments: Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration, and Reconstruction. 3.	 Demonstrated ability, experience and technical competence in the type of work required under this contract,  (i.e., knowledge of indigenous cultures and practices, vernacular architectural styles, historical design and construction methods, sustainable design, natural resources processes and sensitivities, Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), cost estimating, etc.) in various climatic regions for the geographic area covered by this solicitation. Capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs. 4.	Demonstration of the quality and effectiveness of the firm's work and quality review and assurance procedures.  Include examples of Quality Control process records demonstrating effectiveness of firm's procedures. 5.	Demonstrated experience with Natural and Cultural Resource Compliance (i.e. NEPA, Section 106) and demonstrated experience with local and state permitting and regulatory requirements with consideration of public water systems, sewage disposal systems, State Fire Marshall reviews, contaminated sites, fuel oil storage and transfer, etc.  Demonstrated ability to integrate compliance and permitting into the construction process. In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (i.e. multiple awards).  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the contract.   SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms that fully meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a Letter of Interest and a SF330.  Submission of any additional supporting material under Section H of the SF330 is encouraged, but only to the extent that it graphically (via drawings and photographs) substantiates the relevant project work specifically described on the SF330.  The additional information should not exceed 20 pages.  It is recommended that submissions be spiral bound and developed and assembled in a manner that chronologically corresponds and addresses the Technical Evaluation Criteria.  Submissions received via e-mail or facsimile will NOT be accepted.  In support of the sustainable practices of resource conservation and material recycling, submissions should be concise, make wise use of recycled/recyclable paper and other materials, and be organized in such a manner that the recyclable materials can be easily removed after evaluation.  To the extent possible, printed/copied double-sided paper documents should be submitted.  Registration in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is required in responding to this solicitation (http://www.bpn.gov).

Additionally, the contractor shall assist the FDA in evaluating the impact of the MedSun program and shall develop methods to link data received to the demographics of the participating hospitals.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center New Orleans (SPAWARSYSCENNOLA) intends to award a sole source contract for Area Security Operations Command & Control (ASOCC) technical support services to St. Petersburg College National Terrorism Preparedness Institute (NTPI) for a period of two (2) years, as authorized by National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007.   The technical support services include  ASOCC program prototypes, pilots, application spiral development, acquisition support, testing, site installation, user training, Tier I - III level customer help desk support, engineering and integration analysis and support, application administration, and lifecycle sustainment of the ASOCC technology suite. The contractor will create specialized ASOCC training materials, including manuals and training courses for class room and web based instruction, continue developing the ASOCC integrated  tool set, continue developing customer interfaces, and refining strategies for meeting outreach strategic objectives.  The SOW contemplates the continued development and expansion of operational concepts and solutions for antiterrorism command and control coordination for homeland security and homeland defense in both classified and unclassified operating environments in support of national Maritime Domain Awareness objectives.  Development objectives include interoperability enhancement among DOD, other government agencies and commercial command and control systems, so that collaboration among homeland security responders is established and assured communications capabilities refined, so that more complete voice, video, and sensor data can be exchanged.  The Contractor will be required to support an ongoing ASOCC development program and maintain field deployed ASOCC tool sets program. The NTPI has been a partner of ASOCC from the early research and development efforts of the Homeland Security/Defense Command and Control Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (HLS/D C2 ACTD) project at SSCNOLA. NTPI opened in 1998 pursuant to authorization under the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act, commonly known as the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act.  Significantly, NTPI is one of the few pre-9/11 institutions of its kind and the only one in the region.  Headquartered at St. Petersburg College, NTPI also has the ability to leverage its partnerships to access the established resources of the Southeastern Public Safety Institute (SEPSI) programs, such as:  Multi- jurisdictional Counter Drug Task Force Training (MCTFT), SEPSI In-service, Fire Science Technology, Emergency Administration and Management, and Criminal Justice. NTPI provides extensive support to our Nation's War on Terror. Due to the complexity of the tool suite, the applications inner workings and NTPI's unique and clear understanding of the ASOCC approach to theater awareness, the Institute's lead is required for the success of the program's next development stages.  NTPI is the only organization with the requisite specialized staff on hand to meet desired development objectives and extend ASSOC capability to MDA. NTPI provides extensive support to our Nation's War on Terror and was named the provider of choice for this work by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007.  A history of ASOCC support is critical to continued development and delivery of an enterprise-wide integrated information management/information technology solution. The program requires a knowledgeable, fully competent contractor with an experienced/specialized staff, supporting the continued development of ASOCC's support of Maritime Domain Awareness during this critical time.  The specialized requirements of this solicitation dictate that only NTPI has the ability to fulfill the requirements. To bring another company up to the same level of knowledge and experience would require a steep learning curve, during which the lack of productivity would not offset any potential savings that maybe gained by competing this requirement.  Moreover, there would be loss of cross pollenization that results from NTPI's partnerships listed above. The investment by St. Petersburg College in the National Terrorism Preparedness Institute in funds for operation, technical laboratories and specialized skilled labor providing specialized support cannot be recouped by savings generated from competing this requirement. Due to the substantial investment by NTPI in the specialized skills to develop, expand and support the ASSOC program, the government does not expect to recover duplicated costs if this contract action is competed and award is made to any other entity than NTPI. The NPTI as designer and production contractor for ASSOC curriculum is the only company that possesses the detailed knowledge and expertise of the ASSOC suites of  hardware, software integration, production, and testing necessary to design, produce, and integrate compatible ASSOC capability to meet Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) objectives.  NPTI has the only known facilities available to perform system level integration, testing and validation of ASSOC capability to MDA. MPTI is currently the only institute with the requisite specialized skill sets to implement ASSOC terminals throughout the MDA domain of users.  This specialized knowledge is necessary to perform requirements studies, trade-offs and analyses, integrated prototyping and testing of proposed terminal design to implement any necessary changes to ASSOC for MDA implementation. The start-up costs to establish similar specialized knowledge, skills, experience and equipment at the NTPI is expected to exceed $5M, based on an analysis of the historical costs associated with the establishment of the NTPI. Projecting a cost savings of $1.4M (20%) through competition for a $7M procurement would not overcome the duplication of $5M start-up costs for another contractor to acquire the specialized skills already established at the NPTI.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive sole source basis with a Coordinating Center, MRI Reading Center, Laboratory Center, and Field Centers for the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).    More specifically, the contractors include the University of Washington, UCLA, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, Wake Forest University, and the University of Vermont. This effort will be a seven-year continuation of Contracts N01-HC-95159 through -95166 and N01-HC-95168, which is in accordance with the authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set for in FAR 6.302-1.  These contractors have been involved in recruitment, examination, and follow-up of participants in an epidemiological study of 6,814 men and women from six communities across the United States. The incumbent contractors have the unique capability to provide these required services to the NHLBI for continuation of this study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. The objectives of this study include: identifying new risk factors for cardiovascular and lung diseases, predictors of decline in ventricular function, the contribution of genetic and genetic-environmental factors in the development of these diseases, and describing the trends and progression of these diseases. Subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression will be examined in relation to sleep duration and quality, cognition, physical functioning, and other factors to study its similarities and consequences. The contract will require an extensive comparison of the ongoing study, which will cover the examination and a follow-up of the cohort.  This will involve administering a 5th clinical examination of the surviving members of the original participants; performance of follow-up for morbidity and mortality; and performance of comprehensive genetic laboratory and statistical activities, data analysis, and scientific publications efforts utilizing the collected MESA data. We do anticipate several subcontracting opportunities during the course of this contract award.  As an example, reading overnight sleep studies will be subcontracted to another organization.  This notice of intent will be issued on or about September 21, 2007 and will close on or about November 5, 2007. The estimated award date will be August 15, 2008. All responsible sources may submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants.  Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered. This is not a request for proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.  Any interested parties in this or other subcontracting opportunities should contact either the Contracting Officer, Cheryl Jennings, cj19f@nih.gov, 301-435-0347, or the Contract Specialist, Katie McNamee, mcnameeke@nhlbi.nih.gov, at 301-435-6674 for further details.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Marie S. Spurgeon Contracting Officer 9169897218     mspurgeon@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the Deadline for the Submission of Proposals under the Prospectus for Lake Berryessa.  On September 25, 2007, the Central California Area Office of the Bureau of Reclamation's Mid-Pacific Region decided to extend the deadline for the submission of proposals under the Prospectus for the operation of seven concession areas located at Lake Berryessa, Napa, California.  Originally scheduled to end on September 5, 2007, and subsequently extended November 2, 2007, Reclamation is extending the proposal submission period for a second time until November 16, 2007 due to pending litigation by four of the seven existing concession contractors.  Proposals must be received at the address listed in the Prospectus no earlier than November 16, 2007 and no later than 4:00 pm November 20, 2007. Any proposals received prior to November 16, 2007 will be returned to the sender. The Prospectus outlines opportunities for Offerors to submit proposals to operate from one to all seven of the concession areas located around Lake Berryessa. The recently completed planning effort that culminated in an Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision provides the basic parameters for the new concession operations at Lake Berryessa. By the time the Pleasure Cove contract expires on December 1, 2007 and the other six concession contracts expire in 2008/2009, the seven existing concession operations at Lake Berryessa will have been operating in a very similar manner for 50 years. For further information, please contact Mr. Pedro "Pete" Lucero, Chief, Recreation Division, Central California Area Office, at e-mail plucero@mp.usbr.gov.

Agency Name  Technical: Naval Health Research Center Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program PO Box 85122 San Diego, CA 92186-5122 Issuing Grants Office: Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Code 230 937 N. Harbor Dr. San Diego, CA 92132-5106 2.  Program Name  Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program 3. Opportunity Title Prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS in foreign militaries 4. BAA Number  DHAPP-BAA 07-001  5. Response Dates  Full Proposals are due no later than 2:00 p.m. EST on 30 November 2007.  6. Opportunity Description  6.1 Background  The US Government has a long history and extensive network of international collaboration and partnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS, providing funding, technical assistance, and program support. These collaborations increase the fundamental understanding of HIV transmission and provide an evaluative basis for prevention and intervention success. The current HIV/AIDS epidemic is devastating.  Militaries, in particular, have been identified as a high-risk population.  In order to target this population, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, California, under the oversight of the Navy Surgeon General, has been tasked to serve as the US Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for the DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP.)    DHAPP has successfully engaged over 70 countries in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS among their respective military services. Most recently, DHAPP is a partner USG organization collaborating with the US Department of State, Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Agency for International Development (USAID) in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). DoD representatives participate in PEPFAR country teams, core teams and technical working groups to help formulate the Country Operational Plans (COP) in the assault against HIV. Working closely with US Department of Defense, US Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and/or strengthening their capabilities to combat HIV.  DHAPP's goal is to maximize program impact by focusing on helping countries/militaries implement a program that identifies technical areas in which resources and attention are concentrated, by support of DHAPP resources. DHAPP works with a country and its military based on the following process: Meet with key partners in country to determine provisional major program areas and other technical assistance needs.  Adapt DHAPP support to a countries need for prevention, care, and treatment of their HIV/AIDS situation based on existing plans and assessments.  Strengthen the military capacity for ownership and behavioral changes over the long term.  Possibly design a program with other country partners who have had successful prevention efforts.  Focus on prevention impact through developing country implementation plans.  Implement and monitor program to ensure accountability and sustainability.  Countries and their militaries need strong programs with courses of action that demonstrate:  Visible support from the military sector  Development of plans of action and policies  Alignment with PEPFAR strategies and priorities Increasing HIV/AIDS awareness within the military sector  Country ownership of the activities  Prevention plans focusing on prevention of sexual transmission through voluntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) management, behavioral interventions, prevention and care of other opportunistic infections, and prevention campaigns  Reduction of mother-to-child transmission, blood and injection drug use (The primary focus of these interventions is on behavior change to reduce the risks of sexual transmission and to reduce stigma associated with HIV infection.)  Surveillance and infrastructure development through programs focusing on HIV/STI/tuberculosis surveillance, laboratory support, monitoring and evaluation, training and information management.   Increasing HIV and HIV/TB care and treatment programs More information about countries DHAPP currently operates in and its existing programs can be found on the DHAPP website, http://www.nhrc.navy.mil/programs/dhapp/index.html .   6.2 Program Purpose and Plan DHAPP continues to rely upon the vital support of various partners, such as non-governmental organizations, in implementing HIV/AIDS programs across the globe.  Each country has a customized plan to help the country/military bring its HIV/AIDS programs to sufficient scale to help reduce the spread of the epidemic and mitigate its impact.  DHAPPs current priority activities include the following: Training of master trainers and peer educators Troop Level HIV/AIDS prevention education and behavior change communication Providing infrastructure and equipment for HIV testing Increasing testing of all military personnel Developing HIV laboratory diagnostic capability Increasing clinical capability for health care of those infected with HIV Effective implementation of monitoring and evaluation procedures This BAA is intended to solicit existing partners and establish new ones in order to expand the DHAPP/PEPFAR program.  Interested sources should submit proposals identifying their plans and capabilities per information in Section IV, Application and Submission information.   Proposals should focus on rapidly extending HIV/AIDS services to additional clients.  Respondents are encouraged to target specific needs with a practical, pragmatic business plan, using small grass-roots organizations to provide community based services as a way to enhance organic capabilities and sustainability. 6.3 Sources of Funding The source of funds is the Department of States Global AIDS Program (O/GAC) to implement the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR.)  The overall program manager for this is the Department of States Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (O/GAC), with DHAPP supplying intermediate support for military specific programs.  Countries programs supported by PEPFAR funds can be found on the O/GAC website: http://www.state.gov/s/gac/.  PEPFAR funds require additional certifications as identified on page 3 of Attachment 1. PEPFAR funds require distinct reports as identified on the DHAPP website, http://www.nhrc.navy.mil/programs/dhapp/proposals/reporting.html   Respondents should be aware that this BAA covers both programs.  The respondents proposals will be reviewed for both funding sources.   7.

USDOD reserves the right to fund any or none of the applications submitted and to negotiate separately with an applicant if such an action is considered to be in the interest of the USG.  Awards will be made on a rolling basis over a one year time period.  Funding will be approved for the initial year activities and will be subject to the available funding and partner performance for each subsequent requested year of support.  USDOD is planning for a program of up to $26,000,000 per year over the next one to three years. Number of Awards: approximately 30  Award Types: Grants, Cooperative Agreements, or Contracts Anticipated Period of Performance for Awards:  The proposed period of performance will be from August 1, 2008 through September 30, 2011 subject to the availability of funding.  However, proposals may describe activities covering no less than one year and no more than three years. Range of Approval/Disapproval Time: Formal proposals are reviewed and selected within six months from submission.  Subsequent awards are usually made within three months from notification. This information is only an approximate estimate and does not obligate the US Government in any way.  Estimated funding amounts may increase or decrease at any times based on current and future appropriations.  III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION  All responsible sources from academia, industry, and non-governmental organizations may submit proposals under this BAA.  No grants may be awarded directly to foreign military establishments.  All respondents must demonstrate the active support of the in-country military in the planning and execution of their proposals.  See Upload Attachment File package.

Most recently, DHAPP is a partner USG organization collaborating with the US Department of State, Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Agency for International Development (USAID) in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). DoD representatives participate in PEPFAR country teams, core teams and technical working groups to help formulate the Country Operational Plans (COP) in the assault against HIV. Working closely with US Department of Defense, US Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and/or strengthening their capabilities to combat HIV.  DHAPP's goal is to maximize program impact by focusing on helping countries/militaries implement a program that identifies technical areas in which resources and attention are concentrated, by support of DHAPP resources. DHAPP works with a country and its military based on the following process: Meet with key partners in country to determine provisional major program areas and other technical assistance needs.  Adapt DHAPP support to a countries need for prevention, care, and treatment of their HIV/AIDS situation based on existing plans and assessments.  Strengthen the military capacity for ownership and behavioral changes over the long term.  Possibly design a program with other country partners who have had successful prevention efforts.  Focus on prevention impact through developing country implementation plans.  Implement and monitor program to ensure accountability and sustainability.  Countries and their militaries need strong programs with courses of action that demonstrate:  Visible support from the military sector  Development of plans of action and policies  Alignment with PEPFAR strategies and priorities Increasing HIV/AIDS awareness within the military sector  Country ownership of the activities  Prevention plans focusing on prevention of sexual transmission through voluntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) management, behavioral interventions, prevention and care of other opportunistic infections, and prevention campaigns  Reduction of mother-to-child transmission, blood and injection drug use (The primary focus of these interventions is on behavior change to reduce the risks of sexual transmission and to reduce stigma associated with HIV infection.)  Surveillance and infrastructure development through programs focusing on HIV/STI/tuberculosis surveillance, laboratory support, monitoring and evaluation, training and information management.   Increasing HIV and HIV/TB care and treatment programs More information about countries DHAPP currently operates in and its existing programs can be found on the DHAPP website, http://www.nhrc.navy.mil/programs/dhapp/index.html .   6.2 Program Purpose and Plan DHAPP continues to rely upon the vital support of various partners, such as non-governmental organizations, in implementing HIV/AIDS programs across the globe.  Each country has a customized plan to help the country/military bring its HIV/AIDS programs to sufficient scale to help reduce the spread of the epidemic and mitigate its impact.  DHAPPs current priority activities include the following: Training of master trainers and peer educators Troop Level HIV/AIDS prevention education and behavior change communication Providing infrastructure and equipment for HIV testing Increasing testing of all military personnel Developing HIV laboratory diagnostic capability Increasing clinical capability for health care of those infected with HIV Effective implementation of monitoring and evaluation procedures This BAA is intended to solicit existing partners and establish new ones in order to expand the DHAPP/PEPFAR program.  Interested sources should submit proposals identifying their plans and capabilities per information in Section IV, Application and Submission information.   Proposals should focus on rapidly extending HIV/AIDS services to additional clients.  Respondents are encouraged to target specific needs with a practical, pragmatic business plan, using small grass-roots organizations to provide community based services as a way to enhance organic capabilities and sustainability. 6.3 Sources of Funding The source of funds is the Department of States Global AIDS Program (O/GAC) to implement the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR.)  The overall program manager for this is the Department of States Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (O/GAC), with DHAPP supplying intermediate support for military specific programs.  Countries programs supported by PEPFAR funds can be found on the O/GAC website: http://www.state.gov/s/gac/.  PEPFAR funds require additional certifications as identified on page 3 of Attachment 1.

<DESC>Sources Sought


This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. Qualified sources are limited to 8(a), Hubzone, and small businesses including service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses and women owned small businesses. Those parties that have an interest and ability to provide FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) with the services detailed below should SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS. The capability statement and supporting data that clearly illustrate/exhibit the contractor's ability to perform the specified requirement, such as previous similar services performed or resumes, must be submitted no later than February 7, 2007. An electronic copy and four hard copies of the capability statement and each supporting document shall be sent to the contact listed in this announcement. This IS NOT a request for proposals. This synopsis seeks to identify the interest from prospective contractors to assist FDA in the ongoing research, development, and implementation of CDRH's Medical Product Safety Network (MedSun).  

Project Description:     

MedSun is a CDRH adverse event reporting/feedback pilot program that has been funded since 2002 under a Task Order contract.  That contract expires in August 2007.  The MedSun program currently includes 350 hospitals and nursing homes which report on-line to CDRH about problems with the use of medical devices.  The program involves investigation of those problems, creating solutions to those issues, and providing feedback to the clinical community about the problems and the solutions.  Educational tools are developed to teach clinicians how to recognize device problems, how to write quality reports about those problems, and how to improve the safe and effective use of devices.  This development is a creative, ongoing process.  The program requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge.  The technical capabilities include: understanding and experience with sociological research, understanding and experience of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases and national health care organizations, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, sound judgment about data quality and usefulness, and development of outcome measures. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to understand the use of medical devices in the clinical community, the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences, and a staff of nurses, physicians, and engineers highly knowledgeable of the use of medical devices in all areas of hospitals. In addition to these technical capabilities, a detailed understanding of federal and state policies related to collection of health care data and medical device adverse events is critical, as well as a detailed understanding of the medical device related statutes of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the associated medical device regulations. 

Because the MedSun program is an ongoing program, there can be no time lag in transitioning the current program from the current contractor to a new contractor.  Therefore, a prospective candidate must have the in-house capability to be able to assume the full project and provide seamless workflow from the beginning of the new Task Order contract.

Describe in detail your proven capability and current in-house capacity to perform all the following required capabilities, as well as those cited in the Project Description paragraph, above:

Experience in recruiting a representative sample of acute-care hospitals for participation in long-term research efforts. If your firm lacks prior experience with this task, describe specific steps that you would take to to recruit and retain acute care hospitals for participation in lo

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is conducting a comprehensive Special Operations Forces (SOF) C-130 avionics study to meet growing obsolescence challenges and capability shortfalls by assessing potential modifications and upgrades for the Air Force Special Operations Command?s (AFSOC) C-130 aircraft inventory to 2025.  Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft included in this study are the AC-130H, AC-130U, MC-130E, MC-130H, MC-130P, and MC-130W.  A range of alternatives is desired, from near-term (fielding prior to 2015) through long-term (2015 to 2025).  The MC-130E/P aircraft will primarily be considered for near-term upgrades only, as they are programmed for recapitalization.  To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2010 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), USSOCOM requires current industry sources and capabilities information.
2.  The objectives of this RFI are to identify Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or commercially available solutions to SOF C-130 avionics challenges, assess technology and manufacturing readiness, and prepare budgetary planning estimates for possible programming initiatives.
3.  USSOCOM seeks information from responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed:
	a. systems integration requirements
	b. evolving Communications, Navigation, Surveillance (CNS), Air Traffic Management (ATM) and navigation safety mandates
	c. modification upgrade requirements
	d. sustainment concerns
Note.  An Additional Information Package is available once an interested respondent registers through Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS).  As the FedTeDS attachment is Export controlled, it can only be accessed by JCP approved parties.  A company may have a cage code indicating their security level, but it does not necessarily mean that you have export control status.  Interested Parties need to register their cage code with the JCP (DLIS) in order to acquire the export controlled status.

http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/faq.asp <-- JCP Faqs with helpful information.
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/cageserv.asp <-- link explains what a cage code is.
4.  For the purpose of this RFI, the term ?proven? means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) ?6? or higher, preferably TRL ?7? or higher.  Adaptation of NDI or commercial solutions is encouraged.  Recommended solutions must meet current SOF C-130 capability, comply with CNS/ATM and Navigation Safety mandates, and provide a basis for future growth in capability.
5.  Interested parties should provide capabilities, qualification statements, and examples that demonstrate their ability to satisfy the required avionics challenges with low integration risk across the SOF C-130 inventory.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information on all or any subset of the areas listed.  No adverse evaluation will result from responses, which address only those specific areas applicable to one?s core business expertise.
6.  Respondents are to use a minimum number of pages to describe in detail the information requested.  Limit responses to no more than 50 pages, including attachments.  Responses are due 28 September 2007.
7.  This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the ?art of the possible? from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for possible uses of platforms within the military.  Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.  Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.  
Note:  Respondent?s attention is directed to the fact that contractor consultant/advisors to the Government will review and provide support during evaluation of submittals. When appropriate, non-government advisors may be used to objectively review a particular functional area and provide comments and recommendations to the Government. All advisors shall comply with procurement Integrity Laws and shall sign Non-Disclosure and Rules of Conduct/Conflict of Interest statements. The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data. Submission in response to this Request For Information constitutes approval to release the submittal to Government Support Contractors.
8.  U.S. and non-U.S. firms with appropriate Export Controll status are permitted to respond to this RFI.  Responses to questions from authorized interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company?s response.  Currently, one-on-one information gathering sessions with respondents are not contemplated.  If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are conducted, they will be offered to those responders that meet the requirements listed in the corresponding document on FedTeDS.  The purpose would be to clarify understanding of the submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss the form of agreement to cover any flight demonstrations.  Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after all qualitative assessments are completed.
9.  Per FAR) 52.215-3  Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997):
a. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request For Information Notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
b. Although ?proposal? and ?respondent? are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.
c. Any proposed solution must meet all Operational, Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) requirements mandated by the Department of Defense.

<DESC>Modified to incorporate the full Scope of General Information (Part I thru V).


PART I.	GENERAL INFORMATION

I.A.	Introduction
The National Labor Relations Board, Division of Administration, Library and Administrative Services Branch is seeking contract support to rent digital postage meters to affix postage to Agency mail.

I.B.	Background
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.

PART I.	GENERAL INFORMATION

I.A.	Introduction
The National Labor Relations Board, Division of Administration, Library and Administrative Services Branch is seeking contract support to rent digital postage meters to affix postage to Agency mail.

I.B.	Background
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  (1) to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and (2) to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Subregional, and Resident Offices.

I.C.	Objectives
The objective of this request is to rent digital postage meters to affix postage to Agency mail.  The meters will be located at   NLRB Headquarters in Washington, DC and 52 field locations located across the nation.

I.D.	Scope
The service provider shall provide digital postage meters to work in conjunction with the Agency-owned Pitney Bowes mailing systems to affix postage to Agency mail.  The meters must fit onto the Pitney Bowes mailing systems owned by the Agency to include Models DM 200, DM 500 and DM 800.  All meters must interface with analog telephone lines to add postage.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.     THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.     REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.     The 423rd Contracting Flight is conducting market research to determine the existence of potential business sources to develop and deliver a critical thinking course of instruction using argument mapping as a teaching method.  

Foundation Thoughts:  
-	Innovation in all-source analysis can work along many vectors.  Information technology, organizational structure, socio-cultural dynamics, ergonomics, and various forms of cognitive enhancement can all compel profound and observable improvements in the process and quality of analytical content.
-	Often times, a return to fundamentals can provide insight and value.  Critical Thinking is a necessary, critical, core skill which should be understood and, ideally, mastered before any intelligence-specific analytical toolset is approached.
-	The definition of ?Critical Thinking? is lacking in consensus,  but at the minimum a definition would reflect the following actions: 

o	Creating. Generating new ideas, products, or ways of viewing things
Designing, constructing, planning, producing, inventing.
o	Evaluating. Justifying a decision or course of action
Checking, hypothesising, critiquing, experimenting, judging.
o	Analyzing.  Breaking information into parts to explore understandings and relationships. Comparing, organising, deconstructing, interrogating, finding.
o	Applying. Using information in another familiar situation. Implementing, carrying out, using, executing.
 
-	Recent scholarship has demonstrated that Argument Mapping, as a pedagogical technique, has driven improvement in critical thinking skills (as measured with the California Critical Thinking Skills Test.). 
-	All intelligence assessments have a bottom line.  Every bottom line is a judgment. Every judgment is the conclusion.  These conclusions drive belief or action.  Facility in argument will improve facility in analysis.
-	This COI is intended to focus intensively on Argument Mapping as a technique to teach Critical Thinking, and then to use student comments, lessons learned, and best practices from the course to decide whether there is sufficient value added to sustain.

Actions/Course Objectives:
-	Introduce Argument Mapping as a practical and useable method to improve 
            critical thinking skills and produce better intelligence analysis.
-	Develop mastery in the basic Argument Mapping lexicon, tools, and techniques
-	Introduce advanced Argument Mapping techniques and provide resources and trajectory for follow-on study
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of argument construction (aggregation) and graphic display [core competency]
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of argument deconstruction (disaggregation) and graphic display
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of specified formal and informal logical fallacy identification. Critical fallacies to focus upon will be determined at a later date.
-	Inspire students to continue practice and application of Argument Mapping in their work. 
-	35 contact hours delivered to 12-15 students

Compulsory Vendor Attributes:
-	Staffed by PhD-level philosophers with specific background in formal and symbolic logic, Philosophy/History of Science, Epistemology, and Argument Mapping theory and practice (to include IT-enablement)
-	Able to provide examples of past performance through testimonial, quantitative metrics, or references.
-	Has high fidelity understanding of all-source intelligence analysis and exposure to multiple interpretations of the Intelligence Cycle.
-	Has experience in teaching, consulting, writing, and research on the application of Enterprise 2.0 culture and enabling technologies on all-source intelligence knowledge generation.
-	Familiarity with the overall state of Critical Thinking scholarship

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is soliciting sources to support the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) plans for nationwide implementation of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B).  This latest technology will change the nation's air traffic control system from one that relies on radar technology to a system that uses precise location data from the global satellite network.  The FAA expects to install ADS-B ground stations throughout the United States by 2014 while decommissioning a significant number of the FAA's air traffic control radars.  Contractor support will involve planning and conducting an efficient flight validation utilizing ADS-B for commercial aviation, analyzing/ recommending safe and efficient airspace changes for commercial aviation that leverage ADS-B technology, and conducting outreach to commercial aviation operators to broaden the acceptance, education and use of ADS-B.

<DESC>Sources Sought


This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. Qualified sources are limited to 8(a), Hubzone, and small businesses including service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses and women owned small businesses. Those parties that have an interest and ability to provide FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) with the services detailed below should SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS. The capability statement and supporting data that clearly illustrate/exhibit the contractor's ability to perform the specified requirement, such as previous similar services performed or resumes, must be submitted no later than February 5, 2007. An electronic copy and four hard copies of the capability statement and each supporting document shall be sent to the contact listed in this announcement. This IS NOT a request for proposals. This synopsis seeks to identify the interest from prospective contractors to assist FDA in the ongoing research, development, and implementation of CDRH's Medical Product Safety Network (MedSun).  

Project Description:     

MedSun is a CDRH adverse event reporting/feedback pilot program that has been funded since 2002 under a Task Order contract.  That contract expires in August 2007.  The MedSun program currently includes 350 hospitals and nursing homes which report on-line to CDRH about problems with the use of medical devices.  The program involves investigation of those problems, creating solutions to those issues, and providing feedback to the clinical community about the problems and the solutions.  Educational tools are developed to teach clinicians how to recognize device problems, how to write quality reports about those problems, and how to improve the safe and effective use of devices.  This development is a creative, ongoing process.  The program requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge.  The technical capabilities include: understanding and experience with sociological research, understanding and experience of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases and national health care organizations, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, sound judgment about data quality and usefulness, and development of outcome measures. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to understand the use of medical devices in the clinical community, the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences, and a staff of nurses, physicians, and engineers highly knowledgeable of the use of medical devices in all areas of hospitals. In addition to these technical capabilities, a detailed understanding of federal and state policies related to collection of health care data and medical device adverse events is critical, as well as a detailed understanding of the medical device related statutes of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the associated medical device regulations. 

Because the MedSun program is an ongoing program, there can be no time lag in transitioning the current program from the current contractor to a new contractor.  Therefore, a prospective candidate must have the in-house capability to be able to assume the full project and provide seamless workflow from the beginning of the new Task Order contract.

Describe in detail your proven capability and current in-house capacity to perform all the following required capabilities, as well as those cited in the Project Description paragraph, above:

Experience in recruiting a representative sample of acute-care hospitals for participation in long-term research efforts.

Experience in training hospital staff in use of electronic reporting system to report device-related events and providing technical support to more than 1000 system users.

Experience in maintaining on-going cooperation from health-care provider organizations in a national, large-scale patient safety reporting effort.

Demonstrated ability to maintain high level of data security handling sensitive data collected from health provider organizations; credibility with hospital community regarding collection and handling of organizationally sensitive data.

Capability to provide programming and systems support to FDA in maintaining and performing enhancements on secure on-line patient safety reporting system.

Demonstrated ability to obtain project participation of nationally-known patient safety experts in an advisory capacity.

Demonstrated ability to produce useful multi-media educational tools designed to teach clinicians to recognize and report problems with medical devices.

Project management staff with knowledge of medical technology and experience in managing a clinically trained staff.

On-board staff, or plans to bring staff on board, with clinical training and hospital-based experience in biomedical engineering and nursing in device-intensive settings with experience in root-cause analysis.

On-board staff, or plans to bring staff on board, with experience in developing device problem codes, and in coding adverse event reports with patient and device problem codes.

Experience in conducting web-based rapid response organizational surveys.

Experience in subcontracting to major medical institutions to conduct research relating to device safety.

Experience in planning, organizing and conducting conferences for 300 to 400 hospital-based staff involved with device safety (such as risk managers and biomedical engineers).

<DESC>Description This is a sources sought announcement only.  There is no solicitation available at this time.     Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 517212 with a SBA size standard of 1500 employees.     Contractors must identify their business type (i.e., large, small, small and disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned small, HUB Zone certified small, or service disabled veteran-owned small business) in their response. The primary mission of the Headquarters, U. S. Army Communications-Electronics Command, Program Executive Office Command, Control and Communications Tactical (PEO C3T), Northeast Regional Response Center (NRRC) is to serve as a test bed for technology inse rtion and to cooperatively build material solutions that fulfill capability sets within a Common Ground Communications Architectural vision for the Army.  Part of this mission involves the promotion of a collaborative environment to highlight and resolve c ommunications infrastructure integration issues between dissimilar networks, including the voice, data, and video systems which support the Homeland Defense/Security response systems.   The NRRC has been tasked by USNORTHCOM to explore the possibilities of sharing Communications Architecture and Information Technology for emergency, extraordinary or temporary operations.  The concept of operations that USNORTHCOM employs requires Joint Ta sk Forces (JTF) to be equipped with traditional military communications systems as well as commercial capabilities.  Elements subordinate to a JTF may not be equipped with military communications capabilities, since their primary mission may be to interfac e with State, local and Federal emergency response services.  To deal with this interoperability challenged environment USNORTHCOM has identified objective and threshold environments with resultant specific technical solutions for deployed DOD elements.  To a large extent, these technical solutions were the result of the expertise and resources brought to bear by the NRRC to mitigate the effects of a complete absence/degradation of communications and situational awareness during Hurricanes Katrina and R ita. Since that time, the NRRC has continued to support deployable elements such as ARNORTH and the 20th SUPCOM by providing engineering and communications support in accordance with USNORTHCOM guidance. To meet ongoing mission requirements the NRRC has identified objective and threshold environments (with resultant specific technical solutions) for deployed DOD elements.  These include:  "	Multiple, geographically diverse, Satellite Teleports connected via dedicated, redundant and diverse terrestrial circuits to a private MPLS based network "	Secure and redundant coverage of all 54 US States and Territories (redundant teleports, satellites and terrestrial connectivity to public Internet and PSTN), plus  private (SIPRnet and NIPRnet networks) "	Global multi-band infrastructure to support X, KU, extended KU, C, and L-BAND transmission schemes "	Ability and authority to provide technical support and monitoring of NIPR & SIPR network infrastructure and services "	Advanced reporting capabilities for providing performance metrics on all aspects of network infrastructure "	Portable IP addressing and telephone numbers.  This portable capability allows the unit(s) to keep the same IP addresses and telephone numbers globally "	An Integrated BGAN (Broadband satellite L-BAND wireless) service has also been activated.  This service provides: "	Direct access from a fully managed INMARSAT Direct Private Access Point Name (APN) to a private MPLS network "	Provides an immediate and effective way to restore essential communications, so that rescue efforts can start within minutes of arriving at the disaster area and continue unimpeded, regardless of the state of terrestrial networks "	The assignment and management of the same block of private IP addresses to both KU and BGAN services "	Two Network Peering Centers connected to INMARSATs meet me points in TeleCity (centers must be equipped with a Telco Class 5 VoIP Switch, able to provide Telco quality VoIP services on a Global Basis) "	Technical Assistance Center (TAC) and Network Operations Security Center (NOSC)  The NRRC is seeking potential sources capable of providing this capability for Homeland Defense/Security (HLD/HLS) operations.  To ensure that Sensitive Information is protected through the project life cycle, the DoD Information Technology Security Certif ication & Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) and DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) will be followed for all DOD-related activities.  This includes all advanced C&A interim guidance required to meet the transition to a streamlined C&A process that supports net-centricity, lends itself to evolving automated C&A tools, and is consistent with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), DoDD 8500.1 and DoDI 8500.2  The contractor must adhere to the National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation process (NIACAP) for all other federal departments and agencies. The contractor must demonstrate past performance of the deployment of a global IP VSAT archite cture.  In addition to the above, the implementation of Department of the Army Regulations such as the Army Regulation 25-2, November 14, 2003, Information Assurance (AR 25-2) will augment the requirements of the DITSCAP.  The contractor must also demonstr ate a capability to support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) and IPv6 technologies. The NRRC Environment also requires that a fully developed security plan addressing each network, hardware and software item of the DOD 8510.1-M, DOD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) Application Manual be in place. Vendors should document their experience in this area including past performance of executing the Facility Security Clearance (FCL) process and of performing network operations and customer care in a cleared facility. The contractor will be responsible for service assurance, delivery, availability/integrity of the network, as well as 24/7/365 proactive monitoring of the network. Proactive monitoring of the network must include a staffed Network Operations Security Cente r (NOSC). The contractor will also be responsible for operating a reactive trouble management and help desk capability. This capability will be a facility that provides full time (24x7x365) reactive trouble management and help desk functions. The contracto r will manage this capability as a single point of contact tier 1 and tier 2 customer care and technical support staff operation. In order to be considered the contractor must provide technical, operational and support staff with current active secret or t op secret clearances. If selected, the contractor must be capable of providing both network services and user services.  Network services shall include satellite reach back, LMR, cellular, wired and wireless Ethernet and radio gateway. User services shall include VoIP, VTC, ema il, chat, white boarding, common operating picture (COP), incident command system, web portal and directory services.  To be considered the contractor must guarantee that all services will be available beginning June 1, 2008. The basic period of performance is expected to be a five (5) year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) IDIQ contract.          In conjunction with the above referenced services, the Government anticipates outleasing facility space pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.  2667. This facility space would be used to house contractor equipment which will be required for the provision of services. Firms capable of performing the described services are invited to submit a description of their capabilit ies and experience in writing.  Responses shall be limited to 3 pages and should include, as a minimum, (1) evidence of relevant past experience; (2) related projects and/or existing systems, etc; and (3) business size as described above.  This sources sought synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under thi s synopsis. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources.  All respondents are required to complete the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) proces s to be considered eligible for any potential Department of Defense contracts.

<SUBJECT>R -- Technical Support for Advisory Board on Radiation Worker Health's Review of NIOSH Dose Reconstruction Program
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),  has a requirement for a contractor to provide technical assistance to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (ABRWH).  

The purpose of this announcement is to provide a draft statement of work and invite public comments about this requirement. The draft is shown below.  Comments should be submitted to Ms. Florence Black at the Contracting Office Address shown above,  via email to fpblack@cdc.gov, or  via fax at 412-386-6843.  Comments are requested by no later than October 31, 2007.

The government intends to issue the Request for Proposals (RFP) as a total small business set aside.  Although subject to change without advance notice, the projected schedule for posting the formal synopsis is on or about January 7, 2008, and the RFP will be posted on or about  March 31, 2008.  

_________________________________________________________________

Technical Support for the Advisory Board on Radiation and
Worker Health?s Review of NIOSH Dose Reconstruction Program

Draft Statement of Work dated September, 2007

C.1. Purpose of Contract

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) , National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Compensation Analysis and Support (OCAS) is responsible for conducting individual dose reconstructions on employees of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies, its contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs) under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA). To support NIOSH?s role under EEOICPA, OCAS has retained the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of major program elements. Under EEOICPA, the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (Advisory Board), is required to review a reasonable sample of dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality, assess the methods for dose reconstruction, and review Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) petitions. To support the Advisory Board, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of tasks related to independent review of the dose reconstruction process.

C.2. Background and Need

In October 2000, Congress and the President enacted EEOICPA, establishing a federal compensation program for employees of the DOE, its contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs). On July 31, 2001, covered employees with cancer, beryllium disease, or silicosis that may be related to work at nuclear weapons production programs of DOE and its predecessor agencies began applying to the Department of Labor (DOL) under the procedures and requirements of 20 CFR Part 30 for lump sum cash benefits of $150,000 and medical benefits. Also, EEOICPA establishes a SEC consisting of employees with 22 specific cancers who worked at three named DOE facilities or participated in certain nuclear tests and who meet certain other requirements. These employees? cancers are presumed to be radiation related. The EEOICPA permits other groups of employees to petition NIOSH to be added to the SEC.
For most employees with cancer, EEOICPA and the DOL?s regulation require a determination by DOL that the cancer was ?at least as likely as not? related to the occupational radiation dose incurred by the employee at a facility covered by EEOICPA. Criteria and guidelines for making this determination are established by EEOICPA. On May 2, 2002, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published 42 C.F.R. Part 81, Guidelines for Determining the Probability of Causation. This rule will be used to determine the probability that an employee?s cancer was ?at least as likely as not? related to employment at a DOE or AWE facility. To make this determination, DOL will refer cases to NIOSH for an estimation of the radiation dose received by the employee.
EEOICPA also established a federal advisory board, The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (Advisory Board) which has among its charges the task of reviewing a reasonable sample of the dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality, assess the methods and procedures for dose reconstruction, review Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) petitions, and advise the Secretary of HHS in these matters.
NIOSH and DOL expect a large number of cancer claims under EEOICPA in the initial five to ten years, many of which will require NIOSH dose estimates. More than 650,000 workers have been employed by DOE and its contractors and subcontractors, not including the employees of the AWEs. To date DOL has forwarded to NIOSH approximately 27,000 claims that require dose reconstructions. While the rate of claims receipt varies, about 200 claims each month are referred to NIOSH by the Department of Labor.
On May 2, 2002, HHS issued 42 C.F.R. Part 82, The Methods for Radiation Dose Reconstruction, that describes the general methods that NIOSH is using to reconstruct occupational radiation doses under EEOICPA (Federal Register Vol. 67 No. 85). These methods are designed to provide fair and efficient processing of a high volume of dose reconstructions. NIOSH will also seek to obtain dosimetry and relevant records and information on a facility or site-wide basis for DOE sites as well as for AWE sites to reduce the volume of records and information that would need to be collected (at greater expense of time and resources) for each individual claim. NIOSH is establishing a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 relational database management system to house these records. The database will include individual claimant data, ?site profile? data and ?worker profile? data.
NIOSH will have a Dose Reconstruction contractor to provide technical support for dose estimation, dose reconstruction and evaluation of SEC petitions submitted in accordance with EEOICPA . The awarded contract will be available on the NIOSH OCAS web site (www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas) prior to the issuance of the formal Request for Proposals for this procurement.
HHS requires technical consultative support for the Advisory Board to conduct the review of the dose reconstruction process. The purpose of this procurement is to continue the services of a contractor to assist the Advisory Board in the review of the NIOSH OCAS dose reconstruction program.

C.3. Contract Tasks

The Contractor shall provide project staff to direct and manage project activities, document work performed by Contractor personnel, prepare reports documenting progress and problems and interface with the Advisory Board.
The Contractor shall document all of the individual steps for each task order performed so that any aspect of a technical review can be evaluated at any point during the course of
performance. The Contractor shall maintain a filing system of all material relevant to each technical review undertaken. The filing system shall be cross-referenced in a manner that allows all material to be easily accessed.
At the conclusion of a contract task, the Contractor may be required to duplicate all records pertaining to the task order not already held by NIOSH.
As an independent organization performing work on behalf of the Government, the Contractor shall provide the support services required to conduct task orders that may include, but not be limited to, the activities listed below.

A. Individual dose reconstruction reviews
B. NIOSH OCAS ?Site Profile? and ?Procedures? Review
C. Review of SEC Petitions

The work associated with each of the Government?s anticipated requirements are set forth in general terms as specified below.

A. Individual dose reconstructions review
The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the reconstruction of dose provides a reasonable estimate of the dose (as needed to adjudicate the claim). The contractor shall evaluate and recommend whether or not the assumptions (individual case assumptions and assumptions applicable to multiple cases) made for dose reconstruction are appropriate and defensible for purposes of this program. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the data from DOE or other sources is of sufficient quality necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate of dose. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the dose reconstruction was performed fairly using NIOSH guidelines and in a manner consistent with other cases.
The contractor shall review all relevant dose reconstruction methodologies and/or procedures employed by NIOSH / NIOSH contractors in conducting individual dose reconstructions and SEC petitions. The contractor shall evaluate whether methodologies and procedures are consistent with requirements under 42 CFR 82 and whether there are sufficient procedures to achieve consistent application of the requirements in 42 CFR 82.
The contractor shall conduct one of three different levels of review on the selected cases: 1) Basic Review, 2) Advanced Review, or 3) Blind Review. The method of review will be determined by the Advisory Board. The number of individual dose reconstruction reviews is estimated to be approximately 62 in the first year. It is expected that there will be approximately 30 Basic Review cases, 30 Advanced Review cases and 2 Blind Review cases. The next four years will also involve a review of approximately 62 cases per year. The breakdown of cases will be the same as described for the first year. The Advisory Board shall determine the cases to be reviewed and the level of review. These
percentages are subject to change by the Advisory Board based on experience with the review process.
The elements of each type of review are detailed below:

1. Basic Review

A. Review Data Collection
Evaluate whether NIOSH received all requested data for the DOE or AWE site from any relevant data source or repository
Evaluate whether the data used by NIOSH for the case was adequate to make a determination with regard to probability of causation.

B. Review Interview and Documentation provided by claimant
Evaluate whether NIOSH appropriately addressed all of the reported work history and events represented by the claimant including but not limited to a) incidents or occurrences, b) actual monitoring practices, c) personal protection practices, and d) work practices
Assure that interview information is consistent with data used for the dose estimate, and if not, evaluate whether reasonable justification is provided.
Review Internal and External Dose Estimates
Evaluate whether all assumptions used in the dose determination are appropriate for a remedial compensation program and whether the benefit of the doubt was resolved in favor of the claimant
Verify dose calculations are appropriate for purposes of determination of Probability of Causation (POC)
Evaluate whether the data were consistent with site radiological monitoring protocols of the time period.
Evaluate the treatment of ?missed dose? and/or ?unmonitored dose? if relevant to the case.
The review of each dose reconstruction shall include an evaluation of all relevant portions of the methods and/or procedures used by NIOSH. This includes, but is not limited to:
Review the internal and external radiation dose reconstruction technical basis documents,
Review of methods for estimating ?missed dose? and ?un-monitored dose? (for cases related to monitoring technology and for cases where monitoring was not performed, monitoring data is not available or incomplete or otherwise inadequate),
Review of the statistical approaches developed for multiple dose reconstructions,
Review procedures used for determining whether data are sufficient to make a reasonable dose estimate,
Review methods or procedures used for substituting exposure information for unavailable or incomplete information,
Review methods for estimating uncertainty in dose and uncertainty distributions surrounding internal and external dose reconstructions on a facility and time specific basis and evaluate whether the benefit of the doubt was resolved in favor of the claimant where there were uncertainties,
Review procedures and questionnaire used for work history phone interview, and
Review the NIOSH methods, procedures and performance in evaluating, analyzing and validating all contractor work products.

2. Advanced Review
The Advanced Review will include all task items in the Basic Review along with the additional tasks listed below:
Review Data Gathering
Review the entire administrative record to evaluate if relevant information exists which was not considered by NIOSH.
Review the relevant aspects of the Site Profile as they apply to the individual case and evaluate the adequacy and completeness of the site profile and evaluate whether the information from the site profile is consistent with the information used for the individual dose estimate.
Evaluate whether, to the extent practicable, all relevant sources of data (e.g., DOE, AWE, CDC, Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC) , Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), External Health and Safety Regulators, Government Accounting Office (GAO) , Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB), Congressional Hearing Records, other research programs, research publications, publications regarding the history of the DOE complex, or administrative/court records) were identified, evaluated and where appropriate, included within the Site Profile database and where appropriate were used in the assessment of the individual dose reconstruction case.
Review Work History Interview and Documentation provided by claimant
Evaluate the effectiveness of the phone interview in ascertaining relevant work history information.
Evaluate whether, for the cases involving survivors, there has been an adequate effort to research co-located workers and other historical records to characterize the individual?s work history.
Review Internal and External Dose Estimates
Evaluate whether the dose estimate is consistent with relevant radiological information within the NIOSH site profile (e.g. air monitoring, wipe data are consistent with bioassay results)
Compare case information and assumptions with relevant co-worker case information and assumptions for consistency

3. Blind Dose Reconstruction
Using all raw data available to NIOSH, the independent expert will develop an Interactive RadioEpidemiological Program ( IREP) dose input file that they feel is sufficient to make a determination with regard to POC.

B. NIOSH OCAS ?Site Profile? and ?Worker Profile? Review

As part of NIOSH?s effort in completing individual dose reconstructions, NIOSH is establishing a ?Site Profile? database for all covered sites. This database includes records relevant to dose reconstruction other than the personnel dosimetry records (e.g. ? process information, characterization information, incident or occurrence reports, summary dosimetric information, etc.). The contractor shall review selected site profiles established by NIOSH to evaluate the quality and completeness of the profiles and the adequacy of the data for purposes of individual dose reconstructions.
The contractor shall review the conditions, processes, practices and incidents at selected DOE and AWE facilities covered under EEOICPA to evaluate the adequacy of the information available in the NIOSH Site Profile. The review should focus on whether the approach used by NIOSH assured completeness of data necessary for purposes of determining individual eligibility for compensation. The review should include a evaluation of whether NIOSH identified, evaluated and where appropriate incorporated all relevant data sources (e.g., DOE, AWE, CDC, EML, NRC, EPA, External Health and Safety Regulators, GAO, DNFSB, Congressional Hearing Records, other research programs, research publications, publications regarding the history of the DOE complex, or administrative/court records) within the site profile. One task in evaluating that the data identification and collection process were adequate may require the contractor to conduct interviews (one-on-one or group) with, employees, employee representatives, advocacy organizations, health and academic researchers and site ?experts? (those with long standing knowledge of processes, materials, events, and exposures). The contractor may be required to conduct meetings with these individuals or groups at locations near the facilities of interest.
As part of NIOSH?s effort in completing individual dose reconstructions and SEC Petition evaluations, NIOSH is establishing a ?Procedures? database to assist in the performance of such efforts. The contractor shall review selected ?Procedures?
established by NIOSH to evaluate the quality and completeness of the ?Procedures? and the adequacy of the ?Procedures? for purposes of individual dose reconstructions and SEC Petition evaluations.
It is expected that there will be 30 ?Procedures? Reviews and 6 Site Profile Reviews in the first year and in each subsequent year of the contract

C. Review of SEC Petitions

42 CFR Part 83, Procedures for Designating Classes of Employees as Members of the Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA of 2000, describes the general procedures to be followed in the review of SEC Petitions. Section 83.15 describes how the Board will consider and advise the Secretary of HHS on a petition.
The contractor shall evaluate Special Exposure Cohort petitions as requested consistent with the provisions of 83.14 and 83.15. Such reviews may focus on the availability and reliability of documents and monitoring data as well as an analysis of the methods proposed by NIOSH to accomplish individual dose reconstructions for members of a considered class. In cases where a site profile is available for a site in question the contractor will make use of such a document. In cases where no site profile is available the contractor will need to develop the basic information needed to evaluate the SEC Petition.
In some cases it may be necessary for the contractor to interview workers and/or site experts to accomplish this task.
At the recommendation of the Board, the contractor may be asked to review either the complete SEC Petition or just an aspect of the petition as designated by the Board.
In a given year of contract performance, it is anticipated that the contractor will review three complete SEC Petitions and an aspect or aspects of three other petitions.

QUESTIONS/ANSWERS (Q&As):

Q:  What is the distance (rise) from the bottom floor to the top floor?
A:  24 FT   

Q:  What is the capacity?  
A:   4000

Q:  Is the equipment room on the bottom floor and close to the shaft?  
A:   Yes, it is on the bottom floor and close to the shaft.

Q:  Is the bottom floor easily accessed from the outside of the building?  Will it be easy to get our equipment to the elevator at the bottom floor?
A:  Yes.  Yes

Q:  Is this a plunger lift?
A:  No, it use to be a plunger lift but it is now a capital elevator.

Q:  Is there a bid estimate available for the work?
A:  No. 

Q:  The synositation states that this is a small business set-aside what happens when you get a large business offer?
A:  Large businesses can submit their bids/quotes but once we determine that they are not a certified small business, we will discard their bid/quote as unacceptable.  

Q:  Being that this is a small business set-aside, will "women-owned", "HUBZone", etc., take preference over a small business?  
A:  All quotes/bids will be viewed as small-business only since that is what we determined the set-aside to be.  No preferential treatment will be given to vendors that have other than small business classifications.

Q: This is a high security Bldg, will vendors have access to it?  
A:  Yes, vendors will have access but we ask for a 24 hour notification prior to work so that we can prepare the customer for the visit (i.e.: escort service)

Q:  Is an escort required?
A:  Yes, at all times.  If two vendors are present, two escorts will accompany them, especially when the two vendors will need to be in separate locations.

Q:  Who is responsible for the phone lines and smoke detectors?
A:  The Government is.

Q:  Will vendors be following the 2005 year code?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Who came up with the specifications for this job?
A:  An independent inspector and the current base elevator contractor.

Q:  Will we accept bids from vendors that DO NOT perform elevator work?
A:  If the vendor's classification codes (i.e.: NAICS, SIC, PCS and/or FSC) are not elevator trade related and they are not technically capable of performing the work, they are not considered.  For this reason, we are again asking that vendor's provide their CAGE Code on their quote package prior to submittal.

Q:  When do we (the Government) expect work to begin?
A:  Anywhere from two to ten days after contract award.   

Q:  What is the Government's expected completion date?
A:  Completion date is expected around mid December.

<SUBJECT>R -- Employment Record Checks
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) intends to renew a sole source agreement to obtain employment record information with TALX Corporation (The-Work-Number). 
   
TALX Corporation provides OPM with employment record information on-line via the internet for subjects of investigations in support of the Personnel Security Investigative (PSI) mission and is also used by tens of thousands of businesses everyday to verify employment status.

The-Work-Number is a database-drive service providing automated (and therefore tamper-resistant) employment verifications for people who work or have previously worked for any of the 1,000 large employers on The-Work-Number database. The data provided is accurate because it comes directly from the employer's payroll systems.  The-Work-Number speeds up the process and lightens administrative support required, thereby lowering costs.  It also lowers the employers' risks of responding with subjective or inaccurate data.

TALX Corporation contracts with various employers nationwide to provide this service to those seeking employment record information.  It allows employees to provide proof of their employment or income anytime of the day, every day of the year.  For employees, The-Work-Number offers security, convenience, and self-service. For employers, The-Work-Number offers increased efficiency and the elimination of cumbersome paperwork.  For lenders and other verifiers, The-Work-Number offers speed and accuracy.  Experience has proven time and again that when the OPM (Government and Contractor) Field Agents are unable to obtain employment history information at the actual employment location, they are ultimately referred to the TALX Corporation to obtain these records.  The information provided by TALX Corporation has been verified and approved for use by the appropriate approval authority within OPM for use in its investigative products.  OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price agreement on other than a full and open competitive basis to TALX Corporation.  TALX Corporation is the available responsible source and no other source will satisfy the needs of the Agency.  The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is not a solicitation for offers, but rather a notice of OPM's intent to negotiate a sole source award to TALX Corporation.  This notice is for information only, and may represent the only official notice.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the APC 120V Smart UPS.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the APC 120V Smart UPS for use as a key component for overseas Consular staff offices.  The APC brand name is required because it is the only UPS that responds to and follows the commands of PowerChute, the software that Consular Affairs uses to generate start-up and shut-down scripts.  These scripts ensure that the database is protected. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested APC 120V Smart UPS without delay so that the pilot testing required for the verification of field functionality can commence as scheduled The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The APC 120V Smart UPS has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Scope of Work

Real Property and Market-Specific Information

Background
The General Services Administration (GSA) is the Federal agency responsible for furnishing office, warehouse, parking, and unique space for Federal agencies.  Space within GSA owned or controlled facilities is assigned to other Federal agencies, which become GSA?s tenants.  GSA recovers its acquisition, investment and operating costs by charging tenant agencies a commercially-based rent.  GSA?s acquisition of space is also market driven and verification of that market is essential.

?	GSA obtains retrospective fair annual rent appraisals to evaluate rent rates that have been charged to tenants in owned Federal buildings.  
?	GSA obtains building valuation appraisals that support management decision for real property asset investments.  
?	GSA needs real property market information to determine acquisition and investment strategies for owned and the correct lease rates in the affected market when GSA rents from Private Sector Landlords.  
?	Credible data support of these requirements is needed, as the clients and stakeholders have a high scrutiny level for real property investments and the rates charged in both owned and leased real property.   


General Specifications

GSA?s Offices of Real Property Asset Management and National Customer Services Management along with the regional counterparts are in need of internet-based computer accessible informational services.  The information need is real property and market-specific: 

?	a comprehensive market building inventory, trends, and analytics, market and submarket statistics and boundary maps; 
?	a variety of interactive custom and demographic reports as well as quarterly major market overview reports of building vacancy and absorption by market and submarket; 
?	confirmed comparable sales transaction, comparable rental rates and lease expirations sortable by property type, property class, geographic location, dates of sale, building size, and a variety of other data fields;
?	Mapping and aerial photographs of buildings and comparable data;
?	building specific data including floor plate information, building photographs, and  tenant floor-by-floor information;
?	and historic trend analytics including rent, vacancy and absorption.

GSA requires a broad geographic informational base with: 

?	on-site system training, telephone and computer-based technical support with 24 hour 7 days a week access;  
?	the ability for the contractor to provide research on specific real property to include current and historical building specific rent rates, vacancy and major improvements;
?	the information be available nationally for the national offices and market specific within the GSA regions;  
?	and information directly accessible by GSA?s employee or its contractor.  

GSA users are of three geographic areas.  

?	National Users ? GSA Central Office requires full access to the information described above for the full geographic markets available in the United States and its territories.  There may also be a limited number of users in a regional office that will require full national access.

?	Regional Users -- GSA is divided into eleven regions of the United States and its territories. (See Map at web site below)  Most of these regions have at least one major market and their uses may be adjusted to specific markets within that region. The users would require access to their entire region.  

http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=8195&channelPage=%252Fep%252Fchannel%252FgsaOverview.jsp&channelId=-12920


?	Metropolis Users ? GSA has regional users that are only interested in a particular metropolitan market.  As an example, the San Francisco Bay area or the New York metropolitan area. 

?	As use of real property information expands, the number of users may correspondingly expand.  At any time during the contract period users may be added or subtracted.  For any user added during a contract period, the cost of the user will be an annual cost for a twelve month duration.  If the service is continued in the following year, the cost again will be an annual cost for a twelve month duration.  If the balance of the contract is less than one year in the final year, the annual cost will be prorated by the number of months remaining.  The spreadsheet pricing is cumulative, with the expectation of economies of scale.   The pricing is a fixed amount for a particular grouping of users (i.e., 1-10 users).  As a new user reaches a higher grouping of users (i.e., the 11th user), the pricing would be the amount for that grid of users (i.e., 11-20).   


Either Central Office or the regions may add or subtract users under this contract.  GSA is under no obligation to renew users.

The Contractor is responsible for tracking users.  A monthly report with the number and type of user, and the duration of service shall be sent to the Contracting Officer.  

Solicitation Notes:

GSA reserves the right to make one or more awards from this solicitation.

The due date for proposals is COB July 2, 2007.  

Questions will be entertained until COB June 21, 2007.  Proposers are requested to use the spreadsheet discussed at the Users section of the above SOW. A Microsoft Word version of the SOW may be requested. Questions and requests for the spreadsheet or Word version of the SOW must be sent via e-mail to:  Steven.Cox@GSA.Gov

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations, Conference Space Rental and Hotel Services located in one of the following geographic areas:  Mystic, CT or Parsippany, NJ.    Request for Proposal VA-777-08-RP-0007 is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of F5 Big IP Premium Level Maintenance for Big 1000 and 2400RCU.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/II owns and has in use F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features: 	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available.  	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.   	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.  	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network.  	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows.  	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system.  	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue to maintain F5 Big IP hardware.<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>36 -- Honeycomb Wash Conveyor System
<SOLNBR>AG-6395-S-07-0072

<CONTACT>Corinne Nygren, Contract Specialist, Phone 6123363235, Fax 6123702106, Email Corinne.M.Nygren@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>***The purpose of this amendment is to post the questions and answers related to this item which are as follows: QUESTION ONE - I have a question on part IX.  Stages 2 3 and 4 below do they need to be heated and if so what temperature? 1)A bleach solution (3-12% bleach) wash station with heaters  capable of heating the solution to 140 F in the wash station. 2) A high pressure rinse station. 3) A low pressure rinse station and 4) A high pressure air drying station.  ANSWER - No heat on stations 2, 3, 4.  QUESTION TWO - What would be the size limitations (or preferences) of this unit?   We understand that you may have a specific area in which you would like to place this conveyor and it would be our desire to accommodate that need. For example, if due to space restrictions the unit can be only  1 meter wide then the honeycomb would need to be sent thought the conveyor one at a time, or in single file.  But if the unit can be 2 meters wide then the honeycombs can be sent though side by side in groups of 2,3, or even 4.  This, of course would greatly effect the required length of the unit.  ANSWER - We have the space for a 2 meter wide washer.  QUESTION THREE - Has there been any R&D done which has determined the amount of time the honeycombs need to remain under "high pressure" wash in order to become clean?  And what pressure can the honeycomb take before they begin to lose their integrity?  ANSWER - The honey comb can withstand up to 1500 PSI. This is the higest pressure we have tested . The wash time required to make the honeycomb clean has not been established.  Remember prior to high pressure wash we will run through a low pressure bleach concentration  wash. ***

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

     Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
 
     Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)--
 
     (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
 
     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held--
 
        (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
 
        (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
 
     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
 
       Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
 
   (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
 
     (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
 
        (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
 
        (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
 
     (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4- year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
 
     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
 
   (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
 
   (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 
     (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests.
 
     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

The Government intends to award a contract without discussions, as permitted by 52.212-1(g).  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors is set forth in descending order of importance. Technical Features list will be compared to the requirements of the customer and shall be evaluated ?PASS? OR ?FAIL? (More important than price) Price The least important, but will become more important as technical and delivery are more closely aligned. Evaluation Criteria:
Technical Proposal:  Technical proposals submitted by each offeror will be evaluated Pass/Fail.  The Government will not give any favorable consideration, preference, ?extra credit,? or other positive evaluation to any matters contained in a section of the offeror?s proposal, which could be construed to exceed the minimum requirements.  If the technical proposal is determined ?fail?, it renders the entire proposal unacceptable.

Offeror must identify whether Brand Name or equal product will be used.

No deficiencies and very few significant weaknesses noted.  Fail (F): The proposal or portion thereof, is unacceptable and clearly inadequate and fails to meet explicit and implicit RFQ requirements. The offeror fails to adequately demonstrate understanding of the requirements or to evidence a solid level of competence in the area.  Only through discussions and a revision to the proposal could the Technical Proposal be deemed acceptable. No reasonable chance of being selected for award as currently submitted.
Price Evaluation:   The offeror?s proposed price will be evaluation on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-3.  The evaluation may include, but not limited to: Price comparison with other offerors, Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and Comparison with Independent Government estimates.
