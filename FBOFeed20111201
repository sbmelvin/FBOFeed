<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to The King Center, 449 Auburn Avenue, NE, Atlanta, GA. 30312 for the effort entitled, The King Youth Empowerment (K.Y.E.) Youth Violence Prevention Discussion Summit. <br /><br />The authority for this sole source is FAR Part 6.302-1. The NAICS code is 813410, Civic and Social Organizations. The work involved with this project is to conduct the King Youth Empowerment (K.Y.E.) Youth Violence Prevention Summit (the Summit). The Summit will focus on the non-violence teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr as applied to the problems of Teen Dating Violence, Bullying, Youth Violence, and Gang Initiation Rituals. The Summit will be held on January 7, 2012, to coincide with the month of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr's birth, and will take place in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr. King's home. <br /><br />The King Center is the only responsible source capable of providing the King Youth Empowerment (K.Y.E.) Youth Violence Prevention Summit. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr was a civil rights leader, recognized proponent of non-violence, and community outreach leader. The King Center was founded to carry on Dr. King's legacy and share his teachings. The King Center holds the intellectual property rights to proprietary "Kingian" youth non-violence training. Since the Summit will focus on the teachings and personal philosophy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. this proprietary training is essential. No other organization can tie the philosophy of non-violence as exemplified by the life of Dr. King, to the issues of Teen Dating Violence, Bullying, Youth Violence, and Gang Initiation Rituals as effectively as the King Center. <br /><br />In addition, Dr. King's Civil Right's legacy gives the King Center unparalleled influence in the Atlanta community, the site of the Summit. Dr. King's Civil Right's work provides The King Center with particularly strong ties to Atlanta's minority community, many of whom stand to benefit from the Summit. The King's Center's unparalleled influence in the Atlanta Area will allow the message of the the Summit to have a greater impact on the community than would otherwise be possible. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to The King Center. However, firms that believe they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Office by December 16, 2011.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Vallerie Redd by email at gfj3@cdc.gov. and reference solicitation #06329 on the subject line.<br />

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>12/19/11.</p>

<p>The Small Business size standard is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>500 employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

<p>Section K-(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications, https://orca.bpn.gov/. Delete: - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov . In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional readonly provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help. Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive, Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 , Tel. 703-872-8600 Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>All Offerors must acknowledgment all amendments if any. Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Ability to Meet Specification(s), Abiltity to meet delivery lead times, Past Performance, and price. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. The solicitation will be available on Fedbizops at www.eps.gov on or about December 2, 2011. No copies of the solicitation will be mailed. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of AIDS has a requirement for a comprehensive and uniform approach to evaluate initial and on-going laboratory capability and readiness to carry out NIAID-funded clinical trial protocols outside the U.S. NIAID places the highest priority on ensuring the safety and optimal management of subjects who participate in its clinical trials and on obtaining reliable laboratory-based data critical for the meaningful interpretation of study findings. Equally important is the safety of those who perform the laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories in the U.S. are required to meet Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) performance standards and participate in a variety of external proficiency testing programs. Though non-U.S. accreditation organizations and providers of proficiency testing programs exist, these vary significantly in their requirements and level of oversight of clinical laboratories.
<p>The purpose of the Patient Safety Monitoring in International Laboratories (SMILE) contract is to provide a comprehensive and uniform approach to evaluate initial and on-going laboratory capability and readiness to carry out NIAID-funded clinical trial protocols by (1) monitoring laboratories compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP), (2) monitoring the ability of laboratories to reliably perform protocol-specified tests by evaluating results obtained with panels of coded samples, (3) providing Labs with various means of assistance, guidance and training to address and prevent recurrence of deficiencies in GCLP and/or proficiency testing, and (4) maintaining a computerized data management system and document library that include lab performance data and guidance documents. Currently, SMILE supports approximately 150 non-U.S. laboratories in 19 countries. SMILE will continue to support laboratories that are part of current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/daids/networks/pages/daidsnetworks.aspx).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a level of effort type contact will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one year beginning approximately November 15, 2012 through November 14, 2013. The requirement will be the delivery of 11.70 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and 11.70 FTE per year for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7).</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include:</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional Labs: During the course of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support new NIAID-supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each Option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 10 Labs. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 0.65 FTE. Up to two (2) Options may be exercised in year 1, year 3, and/or year 5 for a total of 30 Options during the life of the contract. Once an Option for additional Labs is exercised, it is the Government's intent to continue the support for the life of the contract. Therefore, when an Option to extend the term of the contract is exercised, Options to extend the support for the Labs will also be exercised.</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional Electronic Data Management System and Document Library services: During the course of the contract, additional specialized expertise may be needed to enhance existing computer software systems in order to accommodate documents, similar to those managed by SMILE, received from other NIAID laboratory-supporting. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 1.25 FTEs with expertise in software development and support. One (1) Option may be exercised in any year of the contract for a total of seven (7) Options during the life of the contract. Once an Option for the additional specialized expertise is exercised, it is the Government's intent to continue the support for the life of the contract. Therefore, when an Option to extend the terms of the contract is exercised, Options to extend support for the additional specialized expertise will also be exercised.</p>
<p>Increased Expertise for Proficiency Testing Oversight Services: During the course of the contract, it may be necessary to acquire Proficiency Testing (PT) Oversight Services when commercial products are not available to monitor Lab proficiency in performing novel Protocol-specified tests (e.g., quantitative TB cultures). If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 2.55 FTEs. One (1) Option may be activated for the acquisition of proficiency testing services in any year of the contract for a total of seven (7) Options during the life of the contract. Once an Option for new PT oversight services is exercised, it is the Government's intent to continue the support for the life of the contract.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about December 15, 2011, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk intends to acquire the short-term rental and maintenance of the fifty-one multi-function devices which are located at the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in Washington, DC.
This is a sole source action to be awarded as a purchase order to Xerox Corporation.  Xerox is the owner and original manufacturer of the machines that are already in place at BUMED. It is not industry practice to rent multi-function devices for such a short time period nor would another firm be able to provide the services in such a short time period without degradation or break in those services. The Period of Performance is from 07 December 2011 through 30 April 2012. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.501(a).
 Please direct any questions concerning this purchase order to Lauren Lauver at Lauren.lauver@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA) and Risk Assessment Activities within the Integrated Air Program (Small Business Set-Aside)
<SOLNBR>SOL-HQ-11-00037
<CONTACT>Michael Ottariano, Contracting Officer, Phone 2025645780, Email ottariano.michael@epa.gov
<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify potential offerors of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management's (OAM's) intent to issue a competitive small business set-aside solicitation to provide technical support to EPA's Air Toxics Program to reduce the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous air pollutants, reduce national non-cancer risks, and address risks that are disproportionately placed on specific subpopulations and geographic regions.</p>
<p>To accomplish these goals, the EPA has integrated its Air Toxics Program into four components. The first component is source specific regulatory programs. This component includes the development and review of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards under section 112(d), of the Clean Air Act (CAA), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources. The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA's Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics initiative. The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales, ranging from national-scale to local-scale assessments. The fourth and final component of EPA's air toxics program is education and outreach.</p>
<p>One purpose of this contract is to provide support for risk assessment activities associated with the first component of EPA's air toxics program. Within the context of this component, EPA evaluates the effects of hazardous and potentially hazardous air pollutants and develops appropriate regulatory strategies. In this role, EPA: (1) identifies, screens, and characterizes air pollutants to determine which should be evaluated further as candidates for being listed as hazardous; (2) reviews and evaluates health and/or ecological assessment documents on hazardous air pollutants; (3) performs risk assessments using EPA methods and models, or other methods and/or models, if more appropriate, to help guide reasoned decision-making; (4) identifies and evaluates alternative control options; (5) gathers information on production, use, emissions, control technology, control cost, and regulatory status to establish appropriate regulatory development priorities; (6) assesses the effectiveness of EPA and State/local programs in controlling hazardous and criteria pollutants; and (7) coordinates with other EPA offices and Federal and State/local programs to develop appropriate single or multimedia (e.g., air, water, solid waste, and/or other media) regulations.</p>
<p>Another purpose of this contract is to provide support for the second, third, and fourth components of EPA's air toxics program. In this role, EPA will develop assessment tools, conduct assessments, communicate the results of assessments, and educate the public. In addition, the EPA will examine the air pollution problem in a more integrated fashion (i.e., considering the cumulative effects of air toxics and criteria pollutants across media rather than conducting separate assessments). This contract will provide support for these integrated assessments.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Cost-Reimbursement Contract from this solicitation through a small business set-aside. The Government will issue work assignments from the resulting contract. The anticipated ordering period includes a twelve (12) month Base Period, and four (4), twelve (12) month option periods with a maximum potential ordering period totaling sixty (60) months. The total estimated level of effort for this requirement in professional labor hours for the Base Period and subsequent option periods is 5,000 hours, with an optional quantity for each contract period of 7,000, with a maximum potential of 60,000 hours.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 Million. This is not a request for submission of proposals. The solicitation for this procurement is anticipated to be released on or about November 2, 2011 with an award anticipated on April 1, 2012. The closing response date will be 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation. This procurement will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation. The contract award will be made using a best value approach, with technical capability being of greater importance than cost or price.</p>
<p>The synopsis, amendments, and other information related to this procurement as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, at: www.fbo.gov and the EPA website, at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm. All interested parties should check these sites frequently for updates.</p>
<p>All inquiries and questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted in writing to Michael Ottariano, Contracting Officer, at ottariano.michael@epa.gov. TELEPHONE CALLS REGARDING THIS PROCUREMENT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<p>One purpose of this contract is to provide support for risk assessment activities associated with the first component of EPA's air toxics program. Within the context of this component, EPA evaluates the effects of hazardous and potentially hazardous air pollutants and develops appropriate regulatory strategies. In this role, EPA: (1) identifies, screens, and characterizes air pollutants to determine which should be evaluated further as candidates for being listed as hazardous; (2) reviews and evaluates health and/or ecological assessment documents on hazardous air pollutants; (3) performs risk assessments using EPA methods and models, or other methods and/or models, if more appropriate, to help guide reasoned decision-making; (4) identifies and evaluates alternative control options; (5) gathers information on production, use, emissions, control technology, control cost, and regulatory status to establish appropriate regulatory development priorities; (6) assesses the effectiveness of EPA and State/local programs in controlling hazardous and criteria pollutants; and (7) coordinates with other EPA offices and Federal and State/local programs to develop appropriate single or multimedia (e.g., air, water, solid waste, and/or other media) regulations.</p>
<p>Another purpose of this contract is to provide support for the second, third, and fourth components of EPA's air toxics program. In this role, EPA will develop assessment tools, conduct assessments, communicate the results of assessments, and educate the public. In addition, the EPA will examine the air pollution problem in a more integrated fashion (i.e., considering the cumulative effects of air toxics and criteria pollutants across media rather than conducting separate assessments). This contract will provide support for these integrated assessments.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Cost-Reimbursement Contract from this solicitation through full and open competition. The Government will issue work assignments from the resulting contract. The anticipated ordering period includes a twelve (12) month Base Period, and four (4), twelve (12) month option periods with a maximum potential ordering period totaling sixty (60) months. The total estimated level of effort for this requirement in professional labor hours for the Base Period and subsequent option periods is 5,000 hours, with an optional quantity for each contract period of 20,000, with a maximum potential of 125,000 hours.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 Million. This is not a request for submission of proposals. The solicitation for this procurement is anticipated to be released on or about November 2, 2011 with an award anticipated on April 1, 2012. The closing response date will be 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation. This procurement will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation. The contract award will be made using a best value approach, with technical capability being of greater importance than cost or price.</p>
<p>The synopsis, amendments, and other information related to this procurement as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, at: www.fbo.gov and the EPA website, at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm. All interested parties should check these sites frequently for updates.</p>
<p>All inquiries and questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted in writing to Michael Ottariano, Contracting Officer, at ottariano.michael@epa.gov. TELEPHONE CALLS REGARDING THIS PROCUREMENT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

These training devices require maintenance, operation, and modification support. The request for proposal (RFP) will use the procedures of FAR Part 12. The proposed contract will be a firm fixed price/indefinite quantity contract with a Base period of one year with four (4), one year option periods. Related simulator efforts may be required under this proposed contract to be defined under separate firm fixed price delivery orders. This requirement is restricted to 100 percent total small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 333319. The small business size standard is 500.

With Government concurrence, equivalent simulator/education experience for personnel outlined in the draft SOW may be substituted provided it is comparable to the specific requirements listed. Offers will be required to identify the categories of personnel to be utilized during this performance of the contract.

Depending on the requirement of a particular modification task, one or more Subject Matter Expert (SME) may be required. Any other types of personnel should be identified within the proposal. The Request for Proposal has an approximate release date of 12/22/11 and will be posted on FedBizOps.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION. The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. Previous 4P A-E contracts have used NAICS code 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees. We anticipate awarding approximately 10-20 contracts to large and small businesses. We are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for CONUS (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region in addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other) will be similar for all contracts. However the TYPE of projects/programs (i.e. MILCON, MFH, SRM) is anticipated to differ between the worldwide and regional IDIQ suites.</p>
<p>We anticipate the development of two separate Statements of Work (SOW), one for worldwide IDIQ awards and one for regional IDIQ awards. However for this RFI the attached DRAFT SOW covers all anticipated services and project/program efforts. The attached DRAFT SOW has changed substantially from the current AFCEE 4PA-E08 SOW. Sections 8.0, 13.2 and 14.0 are examples of scope areas that have been significantly revised or updated. Recommend review of entire SOW. All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION. These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br />ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF WORLDWIDE SERVICES<br />To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM projects. The SRM projects will be limited to locations overseas and contingency operations (as defined under 10 USC, 101 (a)(13)). The anticipated services include:</p>
<p>&bull; Title I Services: Title I services are related to a specific construction project and consist of conducting field surveys and investigations to obtain design data and preparing contract plans, specifications, and cost estimates. Title I services may include all aspects of design such as preparation and/or review of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, building commissioning services and preparation of operating and design manuals. Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, and operation, monitoring, topographic survey services, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems<br /><br />&bull; Title II Services: Title II services are related to a specific construction project and consist of supervision and inspection of construction. Title II services may include all aspects of construction quality assurance and oversight of environmental and facility construction and renovation projects</p>
<p>&bull; Other A-E Services: These services are design and construction-related services, but are not connected with a specific construction project. The services may consist of developing design criteria, fact finding studies, surveys, investigations, and the performance of environmental projects involving prevention, compliance, and restoration when the services of registered architects or engineers are required.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted. The Air Force is hereby soliciting capability statements from interested sources for the Engineering Services Contract in support of the F-5 and T-38 aircraft assigned to the F-5 and T-38 System Program Offices (SPOs) located at Hill AFB, UT.
<p>1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SSS is to gather comments and potential sources for providing engineering and associated technical activities on the T-38 aircraft. The T-38 and much of the relevant data is allegedly in the control of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) at present and as such; tasks will revolve around first obtaining access to that data held by NGC, then assisting with develop/provide analysis, assessments, studies, component and system-level component design or testing to substantiate a new or improved component or sub-system capability, and provide configuration management support.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND: The F-5 and T-38 are mature and proven aircraft, requiring specialized engineering to ensure system sustainment. The F-5 is currently not in use by the USAF, but it supported by the USAF through the Technical Coordination Group (TCG). The T-38 aircraft is in active use by the USAF, with a programmed retirement starting in 2020+. To sustain the T-38 weapon system, the USAF fleet has undergone a number of modification programs since its initial acquisition and fielding by the AF in 1961.</p>
<p>3. POTENTIAL OFFERORS: Currently NG and the USAF disagree on the USAF license rights to much of the F-5 and T-38 data. Some issues have been resolved but many others have not and there is no set date for the resolution of these disputes. Interested parties need to provide demonstrated experience with the T-38 aircraft, access to relevant data from NGC and knowledge associated with the following tasks:</p>
<p>A. Data rights: Licensee/Licensor challenges, providing examples of strategies used for developing arrangements with Northrop Grumman Corp (NGC) the OEM for F-5 and T38 aircraft for use of Northrop data:</p>
<p>i. NGC retains legacy data and experience for the F-5 and T-38 platforms</p>
<p>ii. NGC alleges limitations on the USAF license rights to some: Process specifications, drawings, tooling design and technical know-how</p>
<p>iii. The 2004 Data Rights Agreement: License Agreement between the USAF and NGC, a copy can be requested</p>
<p>B. Working to the guidelines of the USAF's Operational Safety and Suitability Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) requirements on the T-38 aircraft.</p>
<p>C. Active contributions and participation in the specialized engineering fields of Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP), Mechanical Equipment and Sub-System Integrity Program (MECSIP), Avionics Systems Integrity Program (AVIP), and the Landing Gear Integrity Program (LGIP) on the T-38 aircraft.</p>
<p>D. Expertise in Non-destructive Inspection (NDI) studies, component/airframe teardown studies, failure and metallurgical analyses, and materials properties and component testing on the T-38 aircraft.</p>
<p>E. Expertise and direct experience with engineering analyses on aerospace systems to include: classical elastic and plastic analysis, static and margin-of-safety evaluations, and finite element modeling/analysis on the T-38 aircraft.</p>
<p>F. Experience with flight testing and flight load data recorders on the T-38 aircraft.</p>
<p>G. Experience supporting/participation with analysis on Class A mishap investigations on the T-38 aircraft.</p>
<p>4. INFORMATION/FORMAT: Potential offerors are requested to provide information on current services meeting the needs of the Air Force in supporting the F-5/T-38 weapon system, or relevant history and evidence of past performance/capability. The Air Force is expecting that the requirement to provide information on current or past services meeting the needs of the Air Force will demonstrate that the offeror's infrastructure and integration capability exists to provide all aspects of this task to include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Company name and associated CAGE code<br />&bull; Point of contact name and number<br />&bull; Business status (8(a), Small, HUBZone, Woman-owned, etc.)<br />&bull; Qualifications/Certification/Aircraft Experience level of employees</p>
<p>5. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS: Please submit two copies of your response to the Sources Sought Synopsis in an executive summary format not to exceed five (5) pages. If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information. Please see below for contact information.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The E-mail Subscription Management (ESM) is a renewal of existing software already utilized on the CMS websites (<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">www.medicare.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/">www.cms.hhs.gov</a>) and is necessary in order to maintain existing subscriptions, contact with the help line, and receive needed upgrades for the software. &nbsp;In FY2007 CMS migrated away from the L-soft system formerly available as a service from NIH due to security, management, and lack of content approval features. This has allowed CMS to centrally manage content being distributed externally via electronic mailing lists for quality control purposes, which has been a significant problem in past years. <br /><br />Transactional Messaging Service (TMS) enhances the email functionality provided through MyMedicare.gov to enable personalized messaging. TMS will, for the first time, give CMS statistics on email delivery rates, open rates and click-through rates. TMS will specifically be used to promote the Blue Button initiative, which is a cross-agency Administration priority.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Citizen Service Management effectively manages internal and external requests and improves communication and access to Agency information.&nbsp; The easy to use web interface software allows end users to submit requests and review the status at anytime.&nbsp; &nbsp;CSM will allow CMS to respond to all forms of communication on a timely basis and increase access to health care data.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.</strong> The Library of Congress' Federal Library and Information Network (FEDLINK) Program is conducting market research, and this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Library of Congress (LC) is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if one is issued.</p>
<p><strong>1.0. Purpose.</strong> The intended purpose of this RFI is to assist LC/FEDLINK in developing potential requirement specifications, as well as to help FEDLINK understand trends in data analytics tools and how to best prepare for current and future government needs in data collecting and analysis. Assistance is needed in identifying and assessing common software applications and tools used to conduct data analytics. Data Analytics is the process of collecting, examining, analyzing and using raw data to better understand, predict, and draw conclusions about that data. Vendors are asked to offer suggestions, comments, and recommendations on data analytics tools that identify meaningful patterns and correlations among variables in large complex, structured and unstructured, historical, and real time data sets.</p>
<p><strong>2.0. Background.</strong> FEDLINK is a nationwide interagency consortium sponsored by the Library of Congress. FEDLINK offers federal agencies information resource and support services to help them fulfill their crucial mission of keeping the Government and the nation informed. LC uses its extensive knowledge of the information industry to establish contractual agreements for commercial information products and services, then makes these agreements available to other federal agencies. FEDLINK contracts are negotiated to achieve the lowest possible price and most favorable terms and conditions for the federal government.</p>
<p>Across the federal government, multiple programs and offices are engaged in research and analysis that use various data sources to inform policy and program decision-making. The use of data analytics tools will enable improved capability and reliability of the results from research and analysis efforts. The insights gained from the use of data analytics tools may be used in policy formulation, design of research projects, support new hypothesis generation, promote construction of new analytic frameworks, inform survey design and metholodology, and other applications.</p>
<p><strong>3.0. Objectives.</strong> The Library of Congress' FEDLINK Program is seeking information on all available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) data analytics software applications and tools for the purposes of facilitating the knowledge discovery process within databases and other sources of data and information. Information is being sought on potential sources, current offerings, capabilities, and industry standards and best practices in data analytics tools that use diverse data sources. Of interest are tools used for all or part of the analysis process including manipulation, mining, querying, reports, visualization, forecasting, statistical analysis, text analytics, and modeling of stand alone, networked, and web-based information. These tools should enable users to interactively analyze and query data without technical support intervention.</p>
<p><strong>4.0. Requested Information.</strong> All entities that offer a data repository and have the ability to perform data analytics on that data and other data sources are encouraged to respond to this RFI. This request is issued for the purposes of receiving information and feedback on the interest and capabilities of potential sources, and informing the government on the type and scope, as well as, appropriate terms and conditions involved in meeting the objectives outlined in this RFI. Include any area of concern not specifically addressed in this RFI that would be important for the government to consider.</p>
<p><strong>5.0. Responses.</strong> Responses to this RFI should not exceed twenty (20) pages and both e-mail and regular mail submittals will be accepted. Marketing brochures will not be considered adequate information as a response to this RFI. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please be advised that all submissions become government property and will not be returned. Interested parties shall submit responses by 2:00 pm (EST) on Wednesday, January 4, 2012. Send e-mail responses to flicc-cl@loc.gov. Please reference the RFI Title "Data Analytics Tools" and RFI #LCFDL12RFI001 in the submissions and in the subject line of the email. All mailed responses shall be addressed as follows:</p>

The government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation.

<p>Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis: Transportation, Treatment, Storage, and Disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB) waste in Japan</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Announcement only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services will take procurement action in this matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, DLA Disposition Services will not be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing the information requested. This announcement is for formal market research only and should not be considered a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The DLA Disposition Services J-7 Acquisition Management Office is conducting market research to determine the capabilities and qualifications of small and large businesses in the Japanese business sector in performing hazardous waste transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal services as related to Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB) waste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>PCB waste is currently securely stored and shipped from various US military installations located in Japan, to various Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDF) located in the continental United States (CONUS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this request is to determine whether there is the capability to properly treat, in-country, some quantity of the PCB inventory to (1) expedite the destruction of United States Forces Japan (USFJ) related PCB's, (2) minimize the potential for adverse environmental impact associated with prolonged storage and transcontinental transportation, and (3), reduce costs to the United States Government (USG). The quantity to be managed in-country will be determined by a variety of factors including the results of the information provided by parties responding to this notice and available funding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this RFI is to assess the potential to obtain disposal of these wastes within Japan only-we are not seeking information about options that would involve export to third countries for disposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The following are the USG's descriptions of its low level PCB items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These descriptions are based on US regulations and definitions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If these descriptions are not practical based on Japanese PCB regulations or industry treatment or disposal standards, please feel free to change or add new descriptions where appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please identify any which you are authorized to treat and have the present capacity or ability to treat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>This notice is for Market Research purposes only, not a request for quotations or solicitation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking sources, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small business, 8(a) certified small businesses, woman owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses as well as small businesses. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractor for providing the items below. All parties may respond to this synopsis.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541711 - Research and Development in Biotechnology with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Project Background</p>
<p>The FDA/National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) has been tasked with conducting various in vitro (cell culture) omics studies to support the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) regulatory mission. As a part of these studies, testing of different tobacco products for their relative toxicity in heart muscle cells is required in order to mimic human cardiovascular effects from smoking. Therefore, large scale pluripotent-stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (as opposed to immortal cells or human primary cells) are required for toxicity testing since they have all the properties of a cardiomyocyte, exhibit a stable phenotype and can be supplied in large quantities (i.e., 23 units).</p>
<p>Funding for this project is contingent upon the availability of Fiscal Year 2012 funds.</p>
<p>Potential contractors must indicate business size, proof of any set-aside certification and company's DUNS number and provide a contact name, the mailing address, phone number and email address of point of contact. Capability statement must provide enough information to determine if company can meet requirements stated above by including technical specifications, descriptive literature, brochures and other information that demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirements. Provide two contact names, email and phone numbers for user of the proposed product that may be contacted by the Government. Identify availability under GSA contract if applicable. Potential contractors proposing a product manufactured by a small business must certify that the product is manufactured by a small business and provide the name and DUNS number of that small business manufacturer.</p>
<p>Responses are due in person, by postal mail or by email to the point of contact listed below on or before December 9, 2011 by 1:00 P.M. CST at the Food and Drug Administration, OC/OA/OAGS, Attn: Marcia Park, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-322, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502. Reference 1097919.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this posting shall be submitted via email no later than 1:00 P.M. CST on December 7, 2011.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to extend the current ISIS contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Air Force Safety Center, Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires an extension to bridge contract FA9401-11-C-0015 which expires on 6 January 2012. The extension will be for the periods of 7 January 2012 to 6 April 2012.
<p>AFNWC/PKOC intends to extend the current contract held by UNIVERSAL TECHNICAL RESOURCE SERVICES (UTRS), 950 KINGS HWY N STE 208, CHERRY HILL, NJ 08034-1518. Interested parties may e-mail brian.clark@kirtland.af.mil or fax 505-846-5744, Attn: Brian "Jason" Clark, not later than&nbsp;7 December 2011, 4:00 p.m. MST.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: The contractor shall support ISIS development and implementation processes, including MFOQA and ASAP analysis capabilities. The contractor shall provide support services, including management and travel, to effect the validation of the MFOQA and ASAP concepts throughout the Air Force and DoD for a variety of aircraft fleets, missions, and reporting communities. The requirements described assist the AF in the development, implementation, operational deployment, assessment, sustainment, and evolution of Air Force and Joint Service MFOQA and ASAP programs. In support of these programs, the contractor shall provide: MFOQA and ASAP data analysis capabilities and MFOQA analyses; knowledge sharing of technological and operational findings, benefits, and advances; collaboration with members of Sister Services on goals and capabilities for joint MFOQA and ASAP efforts; and publication and dissemination of educational materials, training materials, and lessons learned.</p>
<p>IAW FAR Part 5.207(c)15(ii), the proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The nature of this extension is to provide MAJCOM Commanders uninterrupted proactive flight safety mishap. Due to such a short period of time, any contractor other than the incumbent (UTRS) would incur start-up costs and ramp-up transition time to meet the current contract's requirements. Those significant costs to hire subject matter experts with experience flying military aircraft would not be recouped in such a short contract period. Also, the transition ramp-up would require significant time under this contract period and would disrupt critical aircraft schedule downtime and loss of a crucial safety capability.</p>
<p>All responsible parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the government. Responsible parties must clearly demonstrate in the submitted documents that there will be no service interruptions and no added investment and start-up costs associated with award of a bridge contract to any contractor other than the incumbent contractor under these circumstances. Documentation submitted will not exceed five (5) pages and will be submitted electronically to the cognizant Contracting Officer listed in the second paragraph above. A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>The US Forest Service intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Govolution L.L.C. Govolution is the sole source provider of the technologies required by the Forest Service for the integrated Pay.gov e-commerce shopping cart. The Forest Service requirements include an e-commerce shopping cart, transaction settlement processes and specialized data interfaces with integrated connectivity to the U.S. Treasury's proprietary Pay.gov payment processing platform. Govolution's Velocity Payment System with v+Cart provides the proprietary interfaces required for the Pay.gov platform. Further, since the integrated Pay.gov v+Cart technology is proprietary, custom development requires Govolution technical services to make the Forest Service required customizations to the core functionality to meet stated requirements by the Forest Service.&nbsp;
<p><br />This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. Any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement. This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representative for consideration for future requirements. Information must be sent to the Contracting Officer, Forest Service Contracting, 3833 S. Development Ave, Boise ID, 83705, via fax to (208) 387-5384 or via e-mail to jbrandt@fs.fed.us. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Forest Service will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Govolution L.L.C.</p>

<DESC><strong>THE SOLICITATION FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE POSTED AT A LATER DATE.&nbsp; <br /></strong><br />IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROJECT, PLEASE CONTACT DANA TAYLOR<br />&nbsp;(541)523-1274<br /><br />In June of 2010, a storm caused an extremely high flow event in Eagle Creek, washing out the side slopes of the road in 3 areas on Forest Service Road 77: Mileposts 25.7, 26.3, and 28.1. This project is to repair the fill slopes utilizing riprap buttressing, an MSE wall, and placing backfill and aggregate surfacing. Development of the riprap and material sources are also included in this project. Final roadbed width shall generally be <br />16', plus curve or fill widening as designed.
<p>At milepost 25.7 and 26.3, large riprap shall be installed along the toe of the fill slope to stabilize the road and protect the slope during future storm events. This riprap shall be keyed into the streambed approximately 4' below the bottom. Backfill shall be hauled from material sources located on Forest Roads 7015075 or 6700140. Riprap shall be obtained from roadside rock outcrops located adjacent to Forest Road 77. If this material cannot be obtained by traditional ripping techniques (i.e., using an excavator or dozer), then controlled blasting shall be utilized. Drainage ditches along the cut sides shall be constructed to reduce the risk of slope failure in areas where culverts are located.</p>
<p>At milepost 28.1, a mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) wall shall be constructed on the fill side to reestablish road width and stabilize the road. The height of the wall shall be approximately 9 feet with a 9:1 batter at the front. Because the wall shall be constructed, no additional riprap is needed in this location. Backfill material for this location shall be obtained from the material source located on Forest Road 6700140. Guardrail may be required at this location due to the vertical drop-off for user safety.</p>

BACKGROUNDRequest for Proposal D11PS40236, Systems Operations and Administration (SOA) was cancelled in its entirety on 10 November 2011.  The solicitation was cancelled so that the Government can revise its requirements in order to achieve mutually beneficial results.

Due to the nature of the proposed revisions, it was necessary to cancel the original SOA solicitation.  A new solicitation will be issued for the revised SOA requirements.  It is a high priority to issue a new solicitation in fiscal year 2012.  A specific date has not been determined for the release of the new solicitation.To aid in our efforts, this Request for Information (RFI) has been issued to obtain information from industry concerning preferred incentives for a proposed contract to provide Systems Operations and Administration for the Department of the Interior, National Business Center.

(NOTE:  This is a commercial requirement, Cost type contracts are prohibited)
SUBMISSIONS AND FORMAT OF RESPONSESAll interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing their responses to the questions listed above.

<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.eb.mil. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.eb.mil is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK, and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is February 2012</strong>. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection.<br /><br /></span>Points of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-8537; Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $3,688,304.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, two (2) line items of the total eleven (11) line items represent the top two (2) products and account for 95.6% ($3,525,738) of the total volume in sales ($3,688,304) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Daylight Savings Time (PDST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The twelve (12) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. </strong></p>

Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box of 6 vials of the item listed below is to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p><br />Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive, Ampoule or Vial , Single Application, Sterile</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be nine (9) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<span>1.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>FDA- Medical Devices, Device Regulation and Guidance.

A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PDST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Gloves, Surgical. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) West is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgery Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is April 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Points of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-8537 and cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Gloves, Surgical. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $7,220,080. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, one hundred twenty nine (129) of the total three hundred three (303) line items account for 80.18% ($5,789,584) of the total volume in sales $7,220,080 in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></span></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Technical/Company Requirements<br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The five (5) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /><br /></strong></span>1.

<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately nineteen (19) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance acceptability requirements outlined below. <br />1. CFR 1910.138, 2008; ISO 13485 / ISO 9000. The surgical glove can be donned without tearing or creating holes in the cuff, palm area or the finger area. No tears, separation of materials or holes should occur during the donning activity.<br />2. ISO 13485 / ISO 9000; CFR 1910.138, 2008. The surgical glove allows for optimal dexterity, flexibility and tactile sensation. The surgical glove must not have any restriction of fingers and hand flexibility; the grasping of an instrument should be performed without effort; no interference in the tactile sensation of instruments and all surgical site tissue(s) should occur.<br />3. ISO 13485 / ISO 9000; CFR 1910.138., 2008. The surgical glove cuff will have a non-restrictive fit, adequate length and placement memory. The surgical glove must not have any restriction of the wrist movement, slippage of the cuff toward the wrist or gaps between the cuff and the surgical gown sleeve.<br />4. ISO 13485 / ISO 9000; CFR 1910.138, 2008. The surgical glove will support the gripping of both wet and dry instrumentation, all supplies and equipment used in the direct surgical setting. The surgical glove should allow the clinician to grasp/grip a wet or dry instrument (or any wet or dry item on the sterile field) and not have these items slip or fall out of the clinician's grasp. <br />5. NPSG 07.05.01; ISO 9001 2008; ISO 13485 / ISO 9000; CFR 1910.138, 2008. The surgical glove will maintain a barrier without leakage. The surgical glove must remain intact, at all times, maintaining the barrier between the clinician's skin surface and the surgical site/sterile field, to avoid any contamination to the patient or of the surgical sterile field. Failure of maintaining this barrier can result in a surgical site acquired infection to the patient and be very costly to the facility in terms of a negative patient outcome and the cost of replacing many if not all items on the surgical field. No leakage or evidence of fluids/materials seeping under the glove surface onto the clinician's skin surface should occur.<br />6. ISO 13485 / ISO 9000; ISO 9001 2008; CFR 1910.138, 2008. The surgical glove will be non-irritating to the clinician's skin. No evidence of a rash, reddening of the hand, fingers or wrist area, no itching, no breaks in the skin, no sensation of burning of the skin surfaces. The surgical glove must not result in evidence of a rash, reddening of the hand, fingers or wrist area, no itching, no breaks in the skin, no sensation of burning of the skin surfaces under normal wearing conditions.<br />7. ISO 13485 / ISO 9000; ISO 9001 2008; CFR 1910.138, 2008. The surgical glove will not have any odor. A glove with an offensive odor can elicit an olfactory reaction or discomfort to the clinician. No odor should be emitted from the surgical glove.<br />8. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1030(d) (3); ISO 13485 / ISO 9000/9001, 2008. The size, type and expiration date of the surgical gloves is clearly identifiable on the package. Illegible print or inadequate information can result in wastage and loss of efficiency to the clinician because the clinician would have to re-glove. The size, type and expiration date of the surgical glove will be clearly identifiable on the package.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes</strong>. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span></p>

Your added rate per thousand sets of "overs" may be used to either increase or de&not;crease your firm's bid price to reach this dollar amount. The failure to provide an added rate for all 3 titles will render your firm's proposal non-responsive.<br /><br />QUALITY: Level 1 printing and finishing attributes are required for this specification. Reference GPO publication 310.1 for attribute requirements. Printing is the predominate production function and none shall be subcontracted. All contractors submitting a quotation shall have passed the NCI Requirements for New Bidders prior to consideration of their quotation for award. A minimum sixty calendar days are necessary for the evaluation processing to be completed.<br /><br />QUANTITY: 1,000 sets and the final film or files used in the production of printing. <br /><br />TRIM SIZE: 8-3/8" x 10-7/8", Saddle wire stitch binding along the 10-7/8" dimension.<br /><br />FURNISHED MATERIALS: A Mac OS-X compatible CD-Rom disk, together with a set of color proofs (laser printed dummy) as a guide to production.

Proofs shall have a PIA/GATF Proof Comparator (or similar process control) affixed to the back or face of the proof. Spot col&not;ors shall be a match of the Pantone reference books on the laminated proofs (with ink draw downs provided for approval, on the proposed substrates).

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 532490 Other Commercial Machinery and Equipment Industrial Rental and Leasing.

52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

(ii)	Customer responsiveness
(iii)	Price

Technical capability and customer responsiveness will both be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  A quote that is considered technically unacceptable or a quoter that is determined to have inadequate customer responsiveness shall be ineligible for award.

Radioisotopes frequently used are 137Cs (T1/2 = 30 yr) and 210Pb (22.3 yr). 137Cesium is produced by above ground nuclear weapon explosions, and has a peak exposure of 1964 that can be used as a date marker for subsequent soil accretion.  210Lead radioisotope accumulates naturally and will be used to measure soil accretion rates over the past 100 to 150 years.  These parameters will be coupled with other measurements (e.g., TC, TP, TN) to obtain rates of organic matter and nutrient accretion and burial in different wetland  and estuarine systems.  Understanding wetland functions associated with nutrient accretion and sequestration assists in understanding the dynamism in biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and carbon and the net ecosystem benefits received from nutrient assimilation and elemental sequestration by wetlands.  Thus, accretion rates developed from 137Cs and 210Pb measurements in estuarine and freshwater wetland sediment and soil cores will provide US EPA with critical data necessary to calculate the wetland ecosystem services of nutrient removal and carbon sequestration.  The contractor shall analyze estuarine sediments and wetland soils (hereafter referred to as ?wetland samples?) for 137Cs and 210Pb activity.  Wetland samples will be obtained from sediment and soil cores provided by US EPA.  Wetland samples will be homogenized by EPA and a dry weight of at least 25 g or greater will be provided to the contractor for radiometric analyses.  Wetland sample mass will vary based on bul k density of the soil.  Wetland samples will be labeled by EPA using a simple sequential numbering scheme (i.e., Site A #001, Site A #002, etc.). Wetland samples will be sent in batches of 50, with the first batch sent on a date identified by the US EPA Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR).  
The contractor shall process the wetland samples within 30 days or less of receipt of the samples, and provide the raw data on radioisotopic activity to the EPA at that time.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, Chemical and Biological Division, Threat Characterization and Attribution Branch, Bioforensics Program is issuing Broad Agency Announcement 12-04 entitled "Whole Genome Approach to Microbial Forensics (WGAMF)" in order to seek out technologies to achieve the following programmatic goals:</p>
<p>&bull; Development and application of mathematical models for statistical confidence measurements in metagenomic analysis<br />&bull; Development of a procedure to support the transfer of viral cDNA generated in a BSL-3/4 laboratory to BSL-2 laboratory for genomic analysis<br />&bull; Whole-genome sequencing to capture the global biodiversity of human, plant and animal pathogens (bacterial, viral and fungal) in support of microbial forensics analysis.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY:</strong></p>
<p>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that DHS S&amp;T will "support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities." Pursuant to this mission the Chemical Biological Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent and defend against a chemical and biological attack. In addition, the division is charged with pursuing research to improve response and restoration, conduct threat risk assessments, and invest in bioforensics research and development. The focus of this BAA is in the area of bioforensics research.</p>
<p>The threat of terrorist or criminal use of pathogenic organisms and their toxins remains of great concern in the United States. There are vulnerabilities and needs to perform microbial forensic analyses for attribution purposes in a rigorous scientific manner. As part of the effort to deter biological terrorism and strengthen the law enforcement response to such an act, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 10, "Biodefense for the 21st Century" established a dedicated central microbial forensic laboratory known as the National Bioforensics Analysis Center (NBFAC), as part of the Department of Homeland Security to provide bioforensics analysis of evidence associated with the event. The NBFAC operates in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the lead investigative agency in acts of terrorism. This BAA seeks research in the following technical focus areas (TFAs) to support the missions of the NBFAC and FBI for evidentiary analysis and interpretation of results to support a criminal investigation. The ultimate goal of this joint mission is the capture, indictment, and prosecution of the perpetrator(s) of the biocrime or terrorist attack.</p>
<p>The NBFAC has instituted a robust, operational molecular biology program with enhanced capabilities to conduct genomic analysis of biological threat agents. The Bioforensics Research and Development Program supports NBFAC operational threat agent identification and characterization through investments in microbial forensics research and next generation technologies to include molecular biology, genomic comparison techniques, genotyping assays and physical/chemical analysis of sample matrix to better understand the origin, evolutionary history, production method and dissemination mechanism associated with the malicious use of biological agents. Pursuant to this mission the Bioforensics R&amp;D Program seeks technologies to achieve the following goals:</p>
<p>&bull; Development and application of mathematical models for statistical confidence measurements in metagenomic analysis<br />&bull; Development of a procedure to support the transfer of viral cDNA generated in a BSL-3/4 laboratory to BSL-2 laboratory for genomic analysis<br />&bull; Whole-genome sequencing to capture the global biodiversity of human, plant and animal pathogens (bacterial, viral and fungal) in support of microbial forensics analysis.</p>
<p>The specific details for each goal identified above can be found in the attached MS Word&nbsp;file that contains Broad Agency Announcement 12-04.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND OBJECTIVES:</strong></p>
<p>BAA 12-04 contains 3 Technical Focus Areas (TFAs), each with an emphasis on a particular aspect of the whole genome sequence-based analytical approach. The 3 TFAs are as follows:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-1</span>:</strong> Development and application of mathematical models for statistical confidence measurements in metagenomic analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-2</span>:</strong> Development of a procedure to support the transfer of viral cDNA generated in a BSL-3/4 laboratory to BSL-2 laboratory for genomic analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-3</span>:</strong> Whole-genome sequencing to capture the global biodiversity of human, plant and animal pathogens (bacterial, viral and fungal) in support of microbial forensics analysis.<br /><br />Bioforensics R&amp;D intends to initially fund a 12 month period of performance for phase 1. TFA 1 and 2 projects will have the opportunity to apply for a phase 2 option year, which will be funded based on performance in the first year and funding availability and priorities. TFA 3 will have a multiple year phase 2 to be funded on a yearly basis based on funding availability, priorities and performance. For option years to be considered for TFA 1 and 2, they must be included in the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>SOLICITATION APPROACH:</strong></p>
<p>For BAA 12-04, a two-stage proposal selection process will be used for this solicitation to minimize the cost and effort for prospective offerors. Stage 1 will consist of the solicitation, receipt, and evaluation of white papers, technical section limited to 5 pages. No formal transmittal letter is required for the Stage 1 responses.</p>
<p>A down-selection process will be conducted by the DHS and those Stage 1 white papers selected will be invited to participate in Stage 2, which will consist of the solicitation, receipt, and evaluation of a Full Proposal, limited to 40 pages, excluding the Formal Transmittal Letter, Cover Page, and Table of Contents. Specific details concerning this source selection process can be found in the attached Broad Agency Announcement to this notice.</p>
<p>For this BAA, awards may take the form of contracts or other transactions (OTs) agreements. In the event an Offeror or subcontractor is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), Department of Energy National Laboratory, or other Federally funded entity, DHS S&amp;T will work with the appropriate sponsoring agency to issue an interagency agreement pursuant to the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) or other appropriate authority. Depending on the nature of the Full Proposals received, DHS S&amp;T will also consider awarding a grant or cooperative agreement. Therefore, the applicable laws and regulations governing the legal vehicle used for award will depend on the legal vehicle chosen by DHS S&amp;T. In this regard, Offerors should propose a preferred vehicle type for DHS S&amp;T to consider for award.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>As previously identified, the attached MS Word file is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 to provide for competitive selection of research proposals. Contracts based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369 "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." A formal Request for Proposals (RFP) will not be issued. Awards under this BAA are planned in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012. No contract awards or other instruments that obligate funds will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The Huntington District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for solar LED lighting systems to be delivered to John W Flannagan Reservoir in Haysi, VA.  Please see the attached solicitation.  This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses.  <br><br>If you are having trouble accessing the attached document, please read the following:<br><br>Website security and trusted certificate authorities have moved to the<br>forefront with the introduction of Internet Explorer 7.0 (IE v7.0/v8.0).<br>ASFI users who have adopted IE v7.0/v8.0 as their standard web browser may<br>have noticed an IE alert stating our ASFI root certificate was not issued by<br>a trusted certificate authority.  This statement is somewhat misleading in<br>that we incorporate the latest DoD root certificates on our ASFI website but<br>IE v7.0/v8.0 does not "recognize" those certificates as trusted since they<br>have not been installed into the web browser by the user.  The instructions<br>below will help resolve this security alert for our ASFI users when<br>accessing the ASFI website. <br><br><br><br>(1) Open Internet Explorer and go to the CA Certificate download page.<br>(http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html)<br>(2) Click the link called "Download Root CA 2 Certificate". A popup will<br>appear.<br>(3) Click "Open". The Certificate Window will appear.<br>(4) In the left frame, open the subfolders until you see the "Certificates"<br>folder. The frame on the right will display a list of certificates.<br>(5) Double-click on the "DoD Root CA 2" certificate. You'll probably see two<br>of them, so double-click the first one. A popup will appear.<br>(6) Click the "Install Certificate..." button. The Certificate Import Wizard<br>will open.<br>(7) Select the "Place all certificates in the following store" and click<br>"Browse".<br>(8) Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".<br>(9) Click "Next" and "Finish".<br>(10) Click the next two "Ok" buttons and close the Certificates window.<br>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Safety and Environmental Health has a requirement for training support services involving classroom instruction and field exercise training for a four-day Shore Confined Space Entry course (Code 500096, G-KSE-024) to a class size of 13 to 25 students. Training shall be held at the following locations: TRACEN Yorktown, Yorktown, VA; TRACEN Petaluma, Petaluma, CA; and Transportable to CG Unit TBD. USCG intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a fixed-price contract for one year with four option years.</p>
<p>The Government has the option to add sessions to, or substitute for, the sessions listed in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) if agreed to by the Contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The training mission of the USCG is to provide quality safety, health, and environmental training to selected personnel in order to enhance skills at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in order to prepare personnel in their designated specialty or field.</p>
<p>Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue training reviews USCG policy COMDTINST M5100.47 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.146, regarding Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue procedures. Program management and implementation are covered including requirements for developing a written Confined Space Safety Instruction. The duties of entrants, attendants, entry supervisor, and rescue team members are discussed in detail. Characteristics of confined spaces are explained and methods taught to identify and distinguish a Non Permit required confined space from a Permit required confined space. Risk management of confined space entry is integrated into hazard recognition, evaluation, control, permitting, and monitoring procedures. Though focusing on shore-confined space, aviation-confined space is also reviewed. An overview of confined space test equipment is performed with each student, practicing calibration and use functions of the equipment. Students perform practical exercises using monitoring equipment to test spaces.</p>
<p>This training is designed for Shore Facility Confined Space Entry and Rescue application. This course is intended for USCG personnel military and civilian who are assigned to shore facilities having confined spaces and who have been assigned duties as attendants, or entry supervisors with responsibilities to test and monitor confined spaces. Personnel attending this course should have completed the online USCG Confined Space Safety Awareness training prior to enrollment in this course and have a basic understanding of industrial safety practices.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

Quotations will only be considered from Cherry Aerospace authorized distributors and should include evidence of being an authorized distributor. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>The closing date for receipt of quotations is January 4, 2012 at 10:00 am EDT. Anticipated award date is no later than February 29, 2012. Quotations are to remain effective for 90 days after close of solicitation. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, FOB point, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate 1. Facsimile quotations are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-335-6790. Point of contact is Tammy Bunting, phone 252-335-6815, and email: Tamela.S.Bunting@uscg.mil.</p>

If you have previously submitted a quote, please resubmit to the new POC.<br><br>(b)  Provide a deadline for submission of questions regarding this solicitation:<br>The deadline for submitting questions related to this combined synopsis/solicitation is Friday, 2 December, 2011 at 0900 AM CST.  No additional questions will be accepted after this deadline.  Any questions should be submitted to Ms. Tammy Benson, email: tammy.j.benson@us.army.mil.<br><br>(c)  Extend the due date for submission of quotes:<br><br>The due date for submission of quotes is extended to Thursday, 8 December, 2011 at 0900 AM CST.<br><br>(d)  Provide answers to the following questions that were submitted:<br><br>Question 1:  FBO identifies the following system requirements:<br><br>These will be cloud systems:<br>Quantity Memory Disk Space<br>3 1GB Ram 65GB <br>1 1GB Ram 700GB <br>3 2GB Ram 70GB <br>8 2GB Ram 80GB <br>3 2GB Ram 80GB <br>1 4GB Ram 155GB <br>1 6GB Ram 73GB <br>1 8GB Ram 72GB <br>10 8GB Ram 600GB <br>1 12GB Ram 3.5TB <br>1 16GB Ram 2TB <br>2 16GB Ram 80GB <br>1 24GB Ram 1TB<br><br>These will be dedicated systems:<br>Quantity Memory Disk Space<br>2 1GB Ram 2TB - Quad Core i7<br>1 2GB Ram 262GB - Quad Core i7<br>2 8GB Ram 146GB - Quad Core i7<br>3 8GB Ram 146*4 RAID5 - XEON 5150<br>1 8GB Ram 300GB RAID1 - XEON 5150<br>4 16GB Ram 700GB - XEON 5460<br>4 24GB Ram 300GB RAID1 - XEON 5150<br><br>For each of the cloud-based systems above, can you identify the CPU and RAID requirements as you have provided for the dedicated systems?<br><br>Answer 1:  The CPU power needed in GHz for the cloud partitions is normally decided by the service provider based on their current cloud configuration.  Each subscriber is guaranteed a certain amount of CPU power.  We expect to have the performance similar to the performance of a Dual Quad Core i7.  At times, if there is "extra" CPU power available from the host hardware, we would like extra processing power without additional cost.<br><br>Question 2:  Regarding the virtualization requirement, we have several questions:<br>a.  Are any of the existing servers/applications running in a virtual environment currently?  If so, what percentage?<br>b.  What virtualization environment will be required (VMware vSphere?  Hyper-V?  Other?)<br>c.  Are you licensed for the virtualization software or do we need to include the virtualization licenses into the quote?<br><br>Answer 2:  None of the existing servers/applications run in a virtual environment currently.  We do not determine the type of virtualization used on a cloud service, the service provider does.  That should be a cost that is distributed to all cloud subscribers and not charged solely to the government.<br><br>Question 3:  Will the contractor be responsible for the networking environment (routers, firewalls, etc.) or just maintenance of the server environment?  Same question for both the dedicated environment as well as the cloud environment.<br><br>Answer 3:  The service provider will be responsible for the networking environment for both dedicated and cloud.<br><br>Question 4:  What are the routine and maximum bandwidth requirements for the cloud systems?  Should we include bandwidth costs into our price quote?  <br><br>Answer 4:  The bandwidth costs should be included in your quote. We do not expect to pay for any bandwidth between dedicated and cloud servers.  Only outside connections to dedicated or cloud. Cloud instances should have 1 gigabit UNMETERED.  Dedicated should have 2000 GB at least with bandwidth capability to increase on either platform as needed (in which the government will pay for the increase). <br><br>Question 5:  What is the place of performance?  Contractor's facility?  Government facility?  Combination of both?<br><br>Answer 5:  This will be housed on the service providers network, which should include the 4 areas of the US and government approved international locations.<br><br>Question 6:  We are assuming that the technical support is for maintenance/support of the server environment only and not to provide end user support for the Army Game.  Is this correct?<br><br>Answer 6:  Correct.  No end user support will be provided by the service provider.<br><br>Question 7:  Regarding licensing support (Objective 0004) and purchasing of remote management equipment (Objective 0005), we have several questions:<br>a.  Should our quote include specific equipment and/or specific software licenses?  If so, please provide more details on both so that we can accurately provide a quote.  <br>b.  We are assuming that future licenses and equipment purchases that are facilitated by the contractor will be funded by the government at the time of purchase.  Is this accurate?<br><br>Answer 7: a. Right now, all servers will be Linux (CentOS) with the possibility of migrating to Windows in the future.<br>b. The government will not be purchasing any equipment.  This is a service contract not a hardware contract.  We will pay for the use of additional servers or licenses as needed.<br><br>Question 8:  Cloud System: what is the CPU power needed in GHz for the cloud partitions?<br><br>Answer 8:  The CPU power needed in GHz for the cloud partitions is normally decided by the service provider based on their current cloud configuration.  Each subscriber is guaranteed a certain amount of CPU power.  We expect to have the performance similar to the performance of a Dual Quad Core i7.  <br>At times, if there is "extra" CPU power available from the host hardware, we would like extra processing power without additional cost.<br><br>Question 9:  Is this all being hosted in Huntsville, AL onsite?<br><br>Answer 9:  This will not be hosted in Huntsville, AL. It will be hosted on the service provider's network infrastructure to include international locations as well as evenly distributed over the US.<br><br>Question 10:  Is there an incumbent providing similar services or this is a new effort? If there is a previous contract, are you able to provide me with the incumbent contract #, contractor's name, value and expiration date?<br><br>Answer 10:  We consider this a new effort.  We have a contract for hosting our current AGS.  This is hosting only.  We have had to purchase all hardware that is used.  In our new effort, we need the service provider to have all of this hardware within their infrastructure for us to use, as needed, across the locations listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO).  This will include the need for international hosting as well.   We also want to be able to take advantage of the Cloud technologies and the current provider isn't able to provide that either.  <br><br>If you have already submitted questions and they are not included in the above list, you must resubmit to the new POC, Ms. Tammy Benson, email: tammy.j.benson@us.army.mil.  <br>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to W31P4Q-12-T-0038 is to provide an answer to the following question that was submitted:<br><br>Question 11:  We had a concern related to Statement of Objectives,specifically regarding the contractor obligation to ensure the disaster recovery and continuity of the solution. <br><br>Previous instruction on the solution had been that we should be spreading the load out between our 4 datacenters (Chicago, Los Angeles, London, and New York).  This, however, would not provide disaster recovery or operational continuity due to the fact that the loss of the any one site with such a distribution in the roles being performed by the servers would cause that specific role to become unavailable.  Ideally, in a situation such as the one you are trying to protect against, you would replicate the entire environment between fewer datacenters, and maintain copies of production databases in both locations - possibly even servicing clients live out of both locations using dynamic DNS redirection.<br><br>What we'd like to know is what the expectation is from the offeror to provide for this redundant architecture, alleviating the concerns for business continuity entirely.  With 50,000 -100,000 concurrent users, based on the SSO, we believe that the best path forward for you and your team would be to duplicate the infrastructure between Chicago and Los Angeles, with an option to replicate to London as well.  Anything less than that and I believe you will be setting yourself up for not only capacity issues, but should a site (Data center) fail, I don't believe you'll be able to handle the load required.<br><br>Answer 11:  Critical parts of the AGS network will need to be distributed across the provider's major data centers, which should include international locations approved by the government.  The game itself should be designed to handle its own operational continuity to a certain extent.  Therefore, servers supporting the actual game would need to have contingency plans in place to allow return to normal operation with as minimal as possible downtime.  This could include RAID setups to handle HDD failures, spare server capacity to handle a server failure, and independent internet connections to handle an internet service outage. The user data (profiles, forums, etc.) is the critical piece to protect, so some sort of offsite backup plan should be developed and performed at intervals determined by the government based on the importance of the applications running at the particular datacenter.  <br><br>A major concern would be the downtime of our servers supporting the websites.  Redundancy of key web servers will be necessary to communicate with users in case of a network failure at the main site. This may be able to be handled by having redundancy for those servers in a different region where the sites can easily be redirected to operating servers. This again would require contingency plans in place to support offsite backups.  The AGS infrastructure effort may not be able to fund the replication of the entire network to handle a catastrophic failure of the data center; therefore, we need to ensure that true replication is held to only those"critical" servers in the infrastructure and that reasonable contingency plans are in place.<br>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the following and request a response <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by COB 15 Dec 2011:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

It is imperative that feedback as to whether the information provided in the Offerors' library is sufficient to respond to the potential RFP be submitted by 15 December 2011, to ensure sufficient time to analyze any submission(s).</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Necessary changes to the DRFP will be made by amendment and/or at final release of the RFP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the responsibility of the Offeror to complete the necessary steps to obtain access to the Offerors' Library. Throughout the acquisition phase, the Government will utilize the Offerors' Library to continue to make available technical data, Q&amp;As and other sensitive information. The Offerors' <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Library contains classified and export-controlled data; therefore, access will be restricted to personnel who have been cleared by MDA Contracting and Security Officials. It may take up to three weeks to gain access so it is vital that requests are submitted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Access to the Offerors' <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Library may be obtained by submitting an email request to <a href="mailto:ClearCompetition@mda.mil">ClearCompetition@mda.mil</a>. The procedure for receipt and review of requests for library access is to obtain and sign an "Offeror's Library Access Agreement". The Government will verify Personnel/Facility Clearance and will then provide the online IP Address application link. The interested Offeror completes and submits the online application. Once the Offeror's MDA portal account has been granted and notification provided to MDA Contracting, the Government will provide access to the Offerors' Library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government intends to make the Offerors' Library available to those Offerors who have emailed <a href="mailto:ClearCompetition@mda.mil">ClearCompetition@mda.mil</a> and completed the necessary steps to obtain access. Again, the Government anticipates that the process will take approximately three weeks to complete.</p>
<p>This amendment once again reminds Offerors that the Government has determined any resulting solicitation will contain an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) provision entitled "NOTICE REGARDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) AGREEMENT(S) (FAR 9.5)" which reads as follows:<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>
<p>a. Responsibility lies with the prime contract offerors to ensure that both they and their proposed subcontractors are not restricted from participating in this proposed acquisition due to an OCI clause in any Federal Government Contract, including, but not limited to, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contracts.</p>
<p>b. Any offeror who has signed, as well as all proposed subcontractors who have signed, a contract with an OCI agreement, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor under any such contract shall submit a written application to the MDA Directorate of Contracting, Sensors Directorate, via email to Ms. Carol Rivard at <a href="mailto:Carol.Rivard@mda.mil">Carol.Rivard@mda.mil</a>, to obtain approval to participate in this acquisition.</p>
<p>c. Further, if either the prime, or any of its proposed subcontractors, is currently performing (or in the process of proposing on) an effort that appears to have a potential conflict with the upcoming acquisition, regardless of whether there is an OCI clause or not, the prospective Prime contractor shall submit a written application to the Directorate of Contracting, Sensors Directorate, via email to Ms. Carol Rivard at <a href="mailto:Carol.Rivard@mda.mil">Carol.Rivard@mda.mil</a>, to obtain approval to participate in this acquisition.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>
<p>d. The Offeror(s) with either of the potential OCI restrictions, described in paragraphs b or c above, shall provide electronically (either via email or on a CD/DVD in MS word, or Acrobat .pdf format: (i) the prime contractor or subcontract OCI clause; (ii) a copy of each contract Statement of Work (SOW); (iii) a copy of each Task Order (TO), technical directive (TD), or Task Assignment (TA) performed or being performed or being performed by the offeror; and (iv) the Government technical point of contact (including his/her current email address, office symbol, and telephone number) for each contract SOW, TO, TD, and/or TA submitted for review. Each file on the email/disk shall be identified by Contract Number, followed by TO, TD and/or TA number, if applicable. The email/disk shall also include a file entitled "Table of Contents", which shall include all Contracts, TOs, TDs and TAs with the name, current email address, office symbol, and telephone number of the Government technical point(s) of contact. <br />(End of OCI Provision)</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The anticipated date for release of the final RFP is early CY2012</span></strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MDA will not directly send potential Offeror's the solicitation documents, notices or amendments. It is the interested Offeror's responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.

The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting, if applicable, will be specified on each task order.<br />(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation.

The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.<br />(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS</p>
<p>Privacy<br />The Contractor shall be subject to the Privacy Act when handling relevant data and materials and shall comply with COMDTINST M5260.2 (Privacy and Freedom of Information Act Manual). The Contractor staff shall attend Government led Privacy Act Training prior to handling relevant data and materials.</p>
<p>Adherence to Regulations and Notices. The Contractor shall ensure that its personnel adhere to the policies promulgated in USCG Regulations, Federal Regulations, Commandant Instructions and Notices.</p>
<p>Professional Appearance. The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard. If the Government feels there is a problem with a Contractor's appearance; the issue will be brought to the attention of the KO who will report the issue to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Employee Identification.<br />Contractor employees visiting Government facilities shall wear an identification badge that, at minimum, displays the Contractor name, the employee's photo, name, clearance-level and badge expiration date. Visiting Contractor employees shall comply with all Government escort rules and requirements. All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times.</p>
<p>Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. <br />The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under any task order awarded under this contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee.</p>
<p>Conflict of Interest. <br />The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Protection of Information. <br />Contractor access to information protected under the Privacy Act is required under this contract. Contractor employees shall safeguard this information against unauthorized disclosure or dissemination in accordance with the law and Government policy and regulation.</p>
<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />Dated - 08/31/2011</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Safety and Environmental Health has a requirement for training support services involving classroom instruction and field exercise training for a four-day Shore Confined Space Entry course (Code 500096, G-KSE-024) to a class size of 13 to 25 students. Training shall be held at the following locations: TRACEN Yorktown, Yorktown, VA; TRACEN Petaluma, Petaluma, CA; and Transportable to CG Unit TBD. USCG intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a fixed-price contract for one year with four option years.</p>
<p>The Government has the option to add sessions to, or substitute for, the sessions listed in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) if agreed to by the Contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The training mission of the USCG is to provide quality safety, health, and environmental training to selected personnel in order to enhance skills at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in order to prepare personnel in their designated specialty or field.</p>
<p>Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue training reviews USCG policy COMDTINST M5100.47 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.146, regarding Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue procedures. Program management and implementation are covered including requirements for developing a written Confined Space Safety Instruction. The duties of entrants, attendants, entry supervisor, and rescue team members are discussed in detail. Characteristics of confined spaces are explained and methods taught to identify and distinguish a Non Permit required confined space from a Permit required confined space. Risk management of confined space entry is integrated into hazard recognition, evaluation, control, permitting, and monitoring procedures. Though focusing on shore-confined space, aviation-confined space is also reviewed. An overview of confined space test equipment is performed with each student, practicing calibration and use functions of the equipment. Students perform practical exercises using monitoring equipment to test spaces.</p>
<p>This training is designed for Shore Facility Confined Space Entry and Rescue application. This course is intended for USCG personnel military and civilian who are assigned to shore facilities having confined spaces and who have been assigned duties as attendants, or entry supervisors with responsibilities to test and monitor confined spaces. Personnel attending this course should have completed the online USCG Confined Space Safety Awareness training prior to enrollment in this course and have a basic understanding of industrial safety practices.</p>
<p>Note: This course does not satisfy confined space entry training requirements for USCG Marine Safety, Law Enforcement, Vessels or Small boat repair personnel.</p>
<p>1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL.</p>
<p>1.3.1 Project Manager. The Contractor shall provide a Project Manager who shall be responsible for all Contractor work performed under the Contract and this PWS. The Project Manager is further designated as Key by the Government (see PWS 1.4).</p>
<p>1.3.1.1 The Project Manager shall be a single point of contact for the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). It is anticipated that the Project Manager shall be one of the senior level employees provided by the Contractor for this work effort. The name of Project Manager, and the name(s) of any alternate(s) who shall act for the Contractor in the absence of the Project Manager, shall be provided to the Government as part of the Contractor's proposal. During any absence of the Project Manager, only one alternate shall have full authority to act for the Contractor on all matters relating to work performed under this task order.

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Safety and Environmental Health has a requirement for training support services involving classroom instruction and field exercise training for a four-day Shore Confined Space Entry course (Code 500096, G-KSE-024) to a class size of 13 to 25 students. Training shall be held at the following locations: TRACEN Yorktown, Yorktown, VA; TRACEN Petaluma, Petaluma, CA; and Transportable to CG Unit TBD. USCG intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a fixed-price contract for one year with four option years.</p>
<p>The Government has the option to add sessions to, or substitute for, the sessions listed in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) if agreed to by the Contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The training mission of the USCG is to provide quality safety, health, and environmental training to selected personnel in order to enhance skills at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in order to prepare personnel in their designated specialty or field.</p>
<p>Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue training reviews USCG policy COMDTINST M5100.47 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.146, regarding Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue procedures. Program management and implementation are covered including requirements for developing a written Confined Space Safety Instruction. The duties of entrants, attendants, entry supervisor, and rescue team members are discussed in detail. Characteristics of confined spaces are explained and methods taught to identify and distinguish a Non Permit required confined space from a Permit required confined space. Risk management of confined space entry is integrated into hazard recognition, evaluation, control, permitting, and monitoring procedures. Though focusing on shore-confined space, aviation-confined space is also reviewed. An overview of confined space test equipment is performed with each student, practicing calibration and use functions of the equipment. Students perform practical exercises using monitoring equipment to test spaces.</p>
<p>This training is designed for Shore Facility Confined Space Entry and Rescue application. This course is intended for USCG personnel military and civilian who are assigned to shore facilities having confined spaces and who have been assigned duties as attendants, or entry supervisors with responsibilities to test and monitor confined spaces. Personnel attending this course should have completed the online USCG Confined Space Safety Awareness training prior to enrollment in this course and have a basic understanding of industrial safety practices.</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />Dated - 08/31/2011</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Safety and Environmental Health has a requirement for training support services involving classroom instruction and field exercise training for a four-day Shore Confined Space Entry course (Code 500096, G-KSE-024) to a class size of 13 to 25 students. Training shall be held at the following locations: TRACEN Yorktown, Yorktown, VA; TRACEN Petaluma, Petaluma, CA; and Transportable to CG Unit TBD. USCG intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a fixed-price contract for one year with four option years.</p>
<p>The Government has the option to add sessions to, or substitute for, the sessions listed in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) if agreed to by the Contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The training mission of the USCG is to provide quality safety, health, and environmental training to selected personnel in order to enhance skills at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in order to prepare personnel in their designated specialty or field.</p>
<p>Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue training reviews USCG policy COMDTINST M5100.47 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.146, regarding Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue procedures. Program management and implementation are covered including requirements for developing a written Confined Space Safety Instruction. The duties of entrants, attendants, entry supervisor, and rescue team members are discussed in detail. Characteristics of confined spaces are explained and methods taught to identify and distinguish a Non Permit required confined space from a Permit required confined space. Risk management of confined space entry is integrated into hazard recognition, evaluation, control, permitting, and monitoring procedures. Though focusing on shore-confined space, aviation-confined space is also reviewed. An overview of confined space test equipment is performed with each student, practicing calibration and use functions of the equipment. Students perform practical exercises using monitoring equipment to test spaces.</p>
<p>This training is designed for Shore Facility Confined Space Entry and Rescue application. This course is intended for USCG personnel military and civilian who are assigned to shore facilities having confined spaces and who have been assigned duties as attendants, or entry supervisors with responsibilities to test and monitor confined spaces. Personnel attending this course should have completed the online USCG Confined Space Safety Awareness training prior to enrollment in this course and have a basic understanding of industrial safety practices.</p>

<DESC>Background: Potable water and gray water (wastewater that does not contain body or food wastes, i.e., from showers and washing machines.) account for a substantial percentage of the logistics support convoys in current Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). Therefore, reducing water demand, by treating gray water and reclaiming potable water, is needed to reduce the number of convoys necessary to bring in potable water and remove gray water. Water logistics plays an increasing role at the tactical edge, where small FOBs are regularly distributed throughout remote regions. <br><br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for water recycle/reuse technology that will, at a minimum, improve the water efficiency at Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOBs during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies. <br><br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013).<br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through 2013 is $1.75M. The estimated maximum funding available for each fiscal year of the project is $1,280,000 in Fiscal Year 2012 and $470,000 in Fiscal Year 2013. Funds which are not expended in a given fiscal year are available in the subsequent years of the project, subject to fund type restrictions. <br><br>Multiple Awards: The Government anticipates awarding up to two (2) contracts as a result of this topic. <br><br>Potential offerors should access the full topic description, terms and conditions, and proposal submission instructions by clicking the link below or copying and pasting the following: <br>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/05RBAA1.htm <br><br>Proposals that reflect a partial solution to the technical objective and description are not acceptable. The government will consider only those proposed projects that address all elements of the objective and description.<br><br>Proposals will be accepted 01 December 2011 through 09 January 2012. Proposals must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, 09 January 2012 using the ASFI Bid Response System (BRS), accessible at:<br>https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm <br>You will find Topic 25 for proposal submission by searching Contracting Opportunities for 'TARBAATOPIC25'.

<DESC>Background: The current and future demands of a highly mobile, resource limited, Forward Operating Base (FOB) Camp call for new/advancements in technologies for wastewater treatment. The Government must continue to improve and optimize its water management to meet mission requirements. The need for reductions in the water supply burden of FOB operations and the safe discharge of wastewater require innovative technologies with the capability to treat gray (i.e., shower water reuse system concentrate) and black water (i.e., kitchen and toilet) so that it can be discharged into the environment, thus eliminating the need for waste hauling. <br><br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for a low-waste generation, energy efficient, gray and black wastewater treatment system that can, at a minimum, be used to support a Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOB during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies. <br><br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013). <br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through 2013 is $1.75M.

<DESC>The following answers are in response to PWS questions/comments (Q/C) from industry received as of 16 February 2011.<BR><BR>Q/C 1.  RE: 3.14.12 Small Business Consideration.  All delivery/task orders below the $1 Million threshold that do not require development/production/maintenance by an original equipment manufacturer or are otherwise restricted by proprietary requirements will be initially set-aside for small business awardees. If after a three (3) day period two or more Small Business awardees indicate that they will not or cannot fulfill the requirement, it will then be solicited to all contract awardees regardless of size.  We recommend that the small business consideration value threshold be increased from $1 Million to between $5-$10 Million. The rationale is based on historical data from the current WWSS contract vehicle. This data indicates the vast majority of WWSS awards were in excess of $1 Million. To incentivize small business participation, the pool of potential procurements that will be set -aside for small business consideration needs to be significant enough to be meaningful in promoting small business.<BR><BR>A1.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer in conjunction with the Small business office will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C2.  RE: CLIN Sheet Format Structure / Price Evaluation.  Although not contained within the draft PWS, we would like to make some recommendation /suggestions for consideration regarding the structure of the CLIN Sheet that may be used / standardized for GTACS RTEP's:<BR>a) Based upon past CLIN Sheets provided in WWSS procurements, we suggests price evaluations be done for each CLIN versus one lump sum total. This recommendation is made so as to prevent Bidders from "gaming" the procurement. Although the Government is still responsible for evaluating price realism for individual CLIN's, the "lump sum" price evaluation structure can lend itself to juggling individual CLIN pricing for pricing strategy purposes and not cost-based purposes.<BR>b) Further to the issue preventing "gaming" and creating an environment for the Government to better assess pricing, we suggests that the Government clearly specify its intentions relative to the exercise of options. Many times for WWSS, CLIN's for optional quantities were presented that looked like the following:<BR><BR>OPTIONS, POP through XX Month Year Total<BR><BR>001 AA 2.0 Widget # 6-50 45<BR>002 AA 2.0 Widget # 51-100 50<BR>003 AA 2.0 Widget # 101-200 100<BR>004 AA 2.0 Widget # 201-300 100<BR>005 AA 2.0 Widget # 301-500 200<BR><BR>Continuing the example, let's assume the Government has identified needs to procure a total quantity of 350 widgets over time. First point is, if he intent is to procure 350, consider one CLIN for 350 period versus a option ladder as depicted above. If funding, mission requirements, etc prevent one single CLIN for the total required quantity, then clearly indicate to industry how the total number will be ordered. Using the sample option ladder above, if 150 widgets are to be procured over time, would the Government execute CLIN's 001 (QTY:50) and 002 (QTY:100) to procure the 150 units, or execute CLIN 003 for 150 units.  Please convey to Industry the manner in which the CLIN's will be utilized. The obvious answer is whatever is in the Government's best interest. That is understood. The situation from Industry's perspective is it may have to protect itself by not providing the quantity discount until the next higher quantity CLIN. For example, assume the procurement is for 150 units. Further assume there is a real production quantity price break from underlying suppliers at the QTY 75 level. The Contractor may not be able to pass this discount on until CLIN 003 if the Government has the option to procure just 65 units under CLIN 002 as an example.  This is admittedly somewhat complicated and confusing to convey. The bottom line recommendation is to allow industry to structure its own optional CLIN's with quantity ranges that provide the most competitive position and ultimately the best value to the Government.  If this cannot be done, then clearly state how quantities of options will be procured per the Option Ladder spreadsheet that is presented as part of the RTEP.<BR><BR>A2.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C3.  PWS 3.9 says that contractors are "not to establish relationships with other GTACS contractors, subcontractors or vendors......." This language implies that companies may not be on more than one team for the bid. Is that the Government's intention or is this language more applicable to collaboration amongst awardees after contract award?<BR> <BR>A3.  The reference PWS 3.9 is in reference to a conflict of interest only. The government encourages Contractors, Subcontractors and Vendors to team partner and or enter into any agreement that does not create a conflict of interest.  Excerpt from the PWS: "3.9 The Contractor agrees to accept and to complete all awarded DOs/TOs and not to establish relationships with other GTACS Contractors, Subcontractor or Vendors in a manner as to create an actual or perceived organizational conflict of interest."  <BR><BR>Q/C4.  Also, considering teammates may be non exclusive to a prime offeror, there most likely will be instances where companies appear on multiple teams.  Is it permissible to be a subcontractor on multiple teams?<BR><BR>A4.  Multiple team participation is permitted.<BR><BR>Q/C5.  Regarding vendors, many vendors, equipment manufacturers and service providers do not typically team exclusively as a business practice. Is it permissible for a vendor to be on multiple teams?<BR><BR>A5.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C6.  Since there are both full and open and small business set aside awards anticipated, is it permissible for an offeror to be both a subcontractor and a prime offeror?  Note that at the June industry day, the government encouraged "cross teaming".  As a result, teaming engagements made early on may conflict with the language in PWS 3.9<BR><BR>A6.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C7.  PWS 3.14.12 states that the threshold for competing set aside TOs among SBs is $1M.  This seems inconsistent with the NAICS code SB size standard of 750 employees and a program ceiling of $10B.  A qualified company with an employee base as little as 50 or up to 750 employees will be easily capable of and extensively experienced with TO thresholds will above $1M.  Will the Government consider increasing the set aside threshold to $5M?<BR><BR>A7.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer in conjunction with the Small business office will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C8.  The Draft PWS paragraph 3.1 Contract Type states, "The Government intends to award ... approximately 6 to 15 contracts."  Is there a further breakdown for number of contracts to be awarded between large and small businesses?<BR><BR>A8.  Please refer to Q/C24. <BR><BR>Q/C9.  Draft PWS Paragraph 3.3 Place of Performance - are there any special site specific requirements for Contractor Sites?<BR><BR>A9.  Hardware and services will be purchased and supplied worldwide, and may have a requirement for a security level of up to and including top secret in individual DO/TO<BR><BR>Q/C10.  Draft PWS Paragraph 3.13.3 Services - will government make the QASP available in advance of the RFP?<BR><BR>A10.  Each delivery order will be unique in nature as such each QASP will depend on each DOs requirements.<BR><BR>Q/C11.  Draft PWS Paragraph 3.14.3 TEP - states, "the TEP size shall not exceed twenty (20) total text pages."  Does this page limitation include both technical/management and the cost part of the DO/TO proposal?<BR><BR>A11.  Yes that is correct.<BR><BR>Q/C12.  Draft PWS Paragraph 4.2 - contract vehicles.  For all the PM's and PDs areas listed, what acquisition vehicles are currently being used?   Is there an archive of DO/TOs awarded?<BR><BR>A12.  There is no complete archive of contractual vehicles that is known that plans to utilize the GTACS contract, other than to say that any of contracts currently supporting the Program Executive Office - Command, Control, Communications Tactical (PEO C3T) are likely candidates to utilize the GTACS contract.<BR><BR>Q/C13.   SAMPLE TASK The draft PWS does not include sample task(s). Recommend that care is exercised in the scoping and selection of sample tasks. Some Federal procurement documents have crafted sample tasks in a manner that unnecessarily limits the participation of small business respondees. One example of this is to write a sample task of scope and scale that only a large business could possibly respond to and then cutting a percentage or portion of the work out for small business responses that in order to adequately answer, still require a complete build-out of an entire system or network (for example) to provide a proposed solution for.<BR><BR>A13.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer in conjunction with the Small business office will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C14.   SAMPLE TASK Recommend that the evaluation sample task include a task that is representative of the types of small business tasks that will be issued under the awarded contract. <BR><BR>A14.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer in conjunction with the Small business office will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C15.   MISSION ALIGNMENT The current iteration of the PWS emphasizes ACAT program level activities and efforts. The stated purpose of GTACS is to have the flexibility to support the GRRIP program, NRRC C3T missions, and DoD Interagency Information Sharing. Recommend that an effort is made to ensure that the PWS does not over-emphasize or solely focus on the ACAT program level of support at the expense of including the appropriate scoping to support the wide range of support services needed across all three support areas. <BR><BR>A15.  The government will take this under consideration.<BR><BR>Q/C16.   CLARIFY TASK What is the relationship between Tasks, Task Areas, and Services in PWS section 3.3? Recommend ensuring alignment and clarity between sections C, L, sample tasks, and M. A point of frustration to RFP respondents are mismatches between these sections that presents challenges when preparing written responses that address the evaluation factors, the PWS, and sample tasks while complying with section L. Recommend providing draft sections L and M to industry for comment.<BR><BR>A16.  Draft Section L&M are anticipated to be released for comment prior to release of the final RFP.  The anticipated release date for the DRAFT Sections L & M has not yet been determined.<BR><BR>Q/C17.  COMMENT 5: CLARIFY 3.1.4 SECURITY This work requires that personnel hold a Top Secret clearance. Contractors must hold a top secret facility clearance to be able to provide these personnel. Should paragraph 3.1.4 be modified to require contractors to have a Top Secret facility clearance with secret safeguarding capability?<BR><BR> A17.  If you are referring to Section 3.8 of the released PWS -Security - Security clearance requirements for All Contractor facilities shall provide an appropriate means of storage for classified documents, classified equipment and materials, and non-classified equipment and materials, in accordance with Operational Security (OPSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC) requirements.  If this is referring to Section 3.4 Facilities - this section refers to government facilities.<BR><BR>Q/C18.  6: 3.2.3 TASK EXECUTION PLAN (TEP) This paragraph requires that contractors submit a TEP within 14 days of receipt of a request for a TEP. For more complex systems (e.g. systems with a large, complex Bill of Materials), 14 days to develop a response may not be reasonable. We recommend that the Government consider including language such as "Unless other specified by the Government" to permit longer responses in these more complex requirements. <BR><BR>A18.  Excerpt from PWS Paragraph 3.14.3 "The Contracting Officer will determine the amount of time allowed for the Contractor to submit a TEP.  On average this will be seven to fourteen calendar days from receipt of the RTEP".<BR><BR>Q/C19.  CLARIFY 3.2.4 TEP APPROVAL Please clarify the basis of award for TEPs. Recommend the use of best value evaluations and source selections.<BR><BR>A19.  The basis of award for TEPs will be determined on a case by case basis. <BR><BR>Q/C20.  Section 1.0 SCOPE 4th paragraph.  The new PWS includes secure communications "...secure communications such as cryptosecurity, transmission security, emission security, traffic-flow security and physical security ..." However, there are no additional details in Section 4.0 Contract Tasks where other Tasking Descriptions are discussed. Could you provide details on the secure communication related tasks that may be included in TO/DO?<BR><BR>A20.  The Sample Tasks will provide the details that the Offeror is expected to bid on.<BR><BR>Q/C21.  Section 4.3.  The Section 4.3 title is "Command Control and Communications - Tactical (C3T) Systems remove". Could you clarify what the word "remove" at end of title indicates?<BR><BR>A21.  That word was a mistype and has been removed.<BR><BR>Q/C22.  Section 4.3.  On the larger end of the spectrum, up to what size antenna dish is expected for GTACS related terminals.  Would these include trailer and/or vehicle mounted systems?  Or are these only single operator transportable systems?<BR><BR>A22.  The Sample Tasks will provide the details that the Offeror is expected to bid on.<BR><BR>Q/C23.  Section 4.3.  Will GTACS only provide Element Management for SATCOM terminal specific hardware and utilize higher echelon Network Management systems from POR such as WIN-T or DGS?  Alternatively, will GTACS procure an overall cross-domain end-to-end network management system?<BR><BR>A23.  GTACS is designed to provide support to Programs of Record and as such can be utilized to support all of the efforts above however for this bid the Sample Tasks will provide the details that the Offeror is expected to bid on.<BR><BR>Q/C24.  3.1 Contract Type:  The Draft PWS states "approximately 6 to 15 contracts are anticipated". Could you clarify the driving factors which will determine the ultimate number or awards, and how many are anticipated for small business?<BR><BR>A24.  Each proposal will be evaluated against the RFP criteria and the mix of Large/Small business Awards will be made after the review of the proposals.<BR><BR>Q/C25.  3.6 Personnel:  First paragraph seems to conflict with Performance Based and Incentive Fee task orders; i.e., no opportunity for contractor to deliver efficiencies.  First paragraph: Will the Government provide a master list of labor categories and qualifications at the contract level? <BR>Last paragraph: This is unclear, i.e., what are "normal" workdays?  Does this preclude 7-day operations?<BR><BR>A25.  The Government will provide a list of labor categories however that Offeror can chose to use their own as long as there is a cross reference to the Government categories.  In either case personnel must be fully qualified for the tasks they are performing.  Because of the broadness of the scope of the contract the Normal Work Day/Work Week is anticipated to be identified on a DO/TO basis, however the Government is not limiting the Offerors and they are encouraged to bid as they see fit.<BR><BR>Q/C26.  3.14.3.1 TEP Preparation: sub para a. - The PWS does not specify "Option" periods, only basic contract years sub para b. - T&M contract type is not specified elsewhere in the PWS<BR><BR>A26.  This is a five year IDIQ each DO/TO will be competed and may have options associated with them.  T&M will be removed from all reference material. There will be no T&M on this contract.<BR><BR>Q/C27.  3.14.12 Small Business Consideration:  Will small business, set-aside delivery/task orders be limited to small business, GTACS primes? Will large business, GTACS primes using 51% - or more - small business participation in their TEP and task execution be eligible for small business set-aside awards?<BR><BR>A27.  Only small businesses can prime a contract in the Restricted/Small Lot.  If a large business wants to play in that lot they must be a sub to a small company and the small business must do 51% on each deliver order they win.<BR><BR>Q/C28.  4.2 Projects, Programs, Products:  Believe PD C-RAM is no longer under PEO C3T<BR><BR>A28.  This list is not all inclusive and this contract is focused on C3T not necessarily PEO C3T<BR><BR>Q/C29.  Reference Draft PWS dated 14 January 2011, the following note is in Section 3.14.3.3, as follows:  Note: The GTACS Office plans to transition the RTEP and TEP submission process from an e-mail or SharePoint delivery to a web-based management information system approach to facilitate ease of management for both Government and GTACS contractors.  The Contractor shall transition its approach for preparation and submission of TEPs as directed by the Contracting Officer at no additional cost to the Government.  Can you define/identify what this web-based management information system is/will be?  Is it an off-the-shelf product or, if a Government product, will it be provided to winning contractors as GFE?<BR><BR>A29.  As of yet the program has not been defined <BR><BR>Q/C30.  As GTACS will be a broad-based IDIQ contract, primes will be working to bring companies onto their teams to satisfy listed, but general requirements - many which will only be defined during the TEP/RTEP process.  The question is, will the Government allow for the addition of new contractors to a winning prime team after contract award?<BR><BR>A30.  The request for the replacement of a sub-contractor after contract award shall be formally made to the contracting officer in writing - along with accompanying rationale for replacement.  The KO will take this information into consideration and either provide or deny this request.  <BR><BR>Q/C31.  The Government announced its intention to release a DRAFT version of Section L, Instructions and Section M, Evaluation Criteria, on or about 11 February 2011.  Does the Government plan to release a DRAFT version of a SECTION B, which is required to properly review the evaluation requirements so that industry can provide meaningful comments back to the Government? <BR><BR>A31.  At this time the government does not anticipate releasing a DRAFT section B.  The release date for the DRAFT Sections L & M has not yet been determined.<BR><BR>Q/C32.  Potential tasks under the IDIQ Contract may require use of a wide variety of COTS hardware and software products.  Will the IDIQ vehicle allow trade evaluation and purchase of COTS from any potential vendor, or must teams arrange for pre-vetted technology vendors on their teams to utilize COTS? <BR><BR>A.32. The Government does not limit the Offeror from purchasing COTS from any vendor to support its bid.<BR><BR>Q/C33.  Does the Government plan to issue a pipeline of the RTEPs planned for release to include Scope of Work, location and anticipated release date after award of the IDIQ vehicle?<BR><BR>A33.  The government will issue an RTEP whenever a requirement is received.<BR><BR>Q/C34.  Will IDIQ contract holders have the opportunity to make site visits prior to RTEP release, especially for efforts requiring construction?<BR><BR>A34.  Construction will not be part of this contract and all references will be removed from the PWS.<BR><BR>Q/C35.   RE: Pg: 7, Sec: 3.2, The period of performance is five (5) years from effective date of award.  Will there be 5 base years and no option years or will it be 1 base year with 4 option years?<BR><BR>A35.  This is a five year IDIQ each DO/TO will be competed and may have options associated with them<BR><BR>Q/C36.    RE: Pg: 6, Sec: 3.1.  The Government intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract, and approximately 6 to 15 contracts are anticipated.  <BR>RE: Pg: 16, Sec: 3.14.12.  All delivery/task orders below the $1 Million threshold that do not require development/ production/maintenance by an original equipment manufacturer or are otherwise restricted by proprietary requirements will be initially set-aside for small business awardees.  How many of the approximately 6 to 15 awards will be set-aside for small businesses?<BR><BR>A36.  This will vary depending on the number of acceptable awards. <BR><BR>Q/C37.  RE: Pg: 17, Sec: 4.1.1 This task area includes the design, development, fabrication, and testing of engineering developmental systems covering the complete range of tactical C3 systems.  The sentence as written would require contractors to design, develop, fabricate, and test engineering developmental systems.  What is meant by engineering developmental system? What is an engineering developmental system?<BR><BR>A37.  An engineering developmental system is a system that the Offeror used to test the design of a system during development before the initial production base line has been approved. <BR><BR>Q/C38.  Sec: 3.1 Contract Type, Pg: 6-7.  We recommend 15 awards, with up to 3 small business reserves.  DPWS shows the Government has designed GTACS to support a broad array of technologies, services and solutions. Because of the diversity of missions/capabilities PEO C3T may service via GTACS, a higher number of prime awards within the range specified provides the Government a competitive field of preferred providers across all requirements.<BR><BR>A38.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C39.  Sec: 3.9 Organizational Conflict of Interest, Pg: 9. The DPWS mentions several times that SETA work will not be performed on GTACS and that organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) might arise for current SETA contractors. OCI is further detailed in section 3.9. We suggest that the Government restrict significant PEO C3T SETA contractors from bidding as a prime.  It is highly likely that if SETA contractors are allowed to prime GTACS that many sub-contractors will not be given fair opportunity to submit responses to RTEPs, because their prime contractor has OCI concerns.  This will restrict the Government from potentially getting the best value solution without access to those subcontractors.<BR><BR>A39.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C40.  Sec: 3.10 Non- Developmental Items and Processes, Pg: 9. we recommend that all bidding primes be original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and/or organic providers of Non- Developmental Items (NDI) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products GTACS is a hardware/solutions focused vehicle. Primes need to have engineering, program/product management, and supply chain management expertise to credibly service mission critical requirements.<BR><BR>A40.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C41.  Sec: 3.13.2 Software, Pg: 10.  We agree that it is in the Government's best interest for software development that the prime contractor shall maintain a software quality system which operates at a Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 systems/software processes capability (or equivalent SEI rating). We concur it is in the Government's best interest that the prime contractors should be required to meet this criteria.  Requiring all prime contractors meet this important quality standard ensures that all prime contractors understand, have quality oversight, controls, and can support the software development, resulting in a high quality and timely delivery to the Government.<BR><BR>A41.  The Government appreciates the concurrence.<BR><BR>Q/C42.  Sec: 3.14 Contract Management, Pg: 11.  Recommend all bidding primes must have a Defense Control Management Agency (DCMA) approved Earned Value Management System (EVMS) at time of proposal submission GTACS is established to support a diversity of technologies, missions, and contract types. The Government will need well-established mechanisms to monitor progress of task execution plans (TEPs). A DCMA approved EVMS will provide a validated approach to ease this Government management need via management systems, planning and budgeting, accounting, analysis, and revision activities.<BR><BR>A42.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C43.  Sec: 3.14.1 Work Control, Pg: 11.  Recommend all bidding primes must have a fully functional web-based task order management system accessible by the Government for status/tracking at time of proposal submission. Once the GTACS vehicle is awarded, task execution volume will create a greater need for ease of management by ACC-APG and PEO C3T personnel. A password authenticated, web-based portal will enable the Government to have real-time access to current status at time of need.<BR><BR>A43.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C44.  Sec: 3.14.3.1 TEP Preparation for all Orders, Pg: 12.  Type of Contract (T&M, FFP, CR) - is sole appearance of T&M contract type in all of the Draft GTACS PWS. Should it be stricken?  Clarify contract types included in GTACS.<BR><BR>A44.  T&M will be removed from all reference material. There will be no T&M on this contract.<BR><BR>Q/C45.  Sec: 3.14.3.3 TEPs for Cost Reimbursement Orders, Pg: 13.  It is stated that labor categories will be used for cost reimbursement orders. It is expected that GTACS TEPs will generally be more hardware focused than services focused. With this in mind, we encourage the Government evaluate labor category pricing only as it relates directly to the sample tasks.  This will provide the Government the opportunity to achieve price realism that relates closer to the RTEPs that are likely to be issued under GTACS.  This will also avoid the unintended consequences of valuating and awarding, based on pricing of a large set of labor categories and assumed hours that are not a true metric to delivering the tactical communications systems that will be the bulk of the GTACS TEPs.<BR><BR>A45.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C46.  We suggest that the sample tasks be priced and awardable.  By requiring priced sample tasks and preferably by awarding these, the Government will receive more accurate and reasonable price and technical data to evaluate. This puts the onus on the contractors to submit "realistic" values and put forth the most technically sound solutions.<BR><BR>A47.  The Sample Tasks are representative of similar tasks that will be awarded under this contract however the sample tasks themselves will not be awarded.<BR><BR>Q/C48.  Will GTACS be a Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) (e.g. other government entities will be able to use the vehicle)?<BR><BR>A48.  Yes <BR><BR>Q/C49.  Will MIPR of funds from other agencies into PEO C3-T be allowed on this contract?<BR><BR>A49.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C50.  On Material Purchases, will there be a pre-established cap on prime contractor fee?<BR><BR>A50.  No, everything will be competed on a full and open basis.<BR><BR>Q/C51.  On work performed by subcontractors, will there be a pre-established cap on prime contractor fee?<BR><BR>A51.  No, everything will be competed on a full and open basis.<BR><BR>Q/C52.  What is the expected mix of Material Purchase vs. Services provided?  During Industry day in July 2010, the KO had announced a 60% Material and a 40% Services mix.  Will this stay the same of some other anticipated mix? <BR><BR>A52. The mix will change however we are anticipating 70%-30% mix of Material and Service in support of said material.<BR><BR><BR>Q/C53.  Based on section 4.2 of the Draft PWS, is the intent to move all stated supporting efforts to the GTACS IDIQ contract or will these efforts be allowed to continue under their existing contracts? <BR><BR>A53. GTACS is an open contract to support all PEOC3-T efforts; it is up to the individual organization to decide how they want to manage their individual programs.<BR><BR>Q/C54. Will any of the 5 Sample tasks be executable?<BR><BR>A54. No  <BR><BR>Q/C55.  Section 4.3 of the PWS states, "Command Control and Communications - Tactical (C3T) Systems remove." Is it the government's intent to remove this PWS paragraph?  <BR><BR>A55. No, the word remove was a mistype and has been removed.<BR><BR>Q/C56.  PWS Paragraph 3.6 - Personnel - Labor requirement will be specified in the RTEP.  Will there be categories or rates at the IDIQ level?<BR><BR>A56. Categories only the Offeror will propose rates.<BR><BR>Q/C57.  PWS Paragraph 3.12 - Travel - All travel requests must be approved in writing by the government.  Who has the authority to approve (KO, COR, COTR, etc.)? <BR><BR>A57.  Only the Contracting Officer (KO) has authority to obligate government funds.  The KO will work in coordination with the COR on such issues.<BR><BR>Q/C 58.  PWS Paragraph 3.13.1 - Hardware - The contractor must maintain a quality assurance system to ensure product integrity.  Is the quality assurance system mandatory at the prime and/or subcontractor level?  If subcontractors have the applicable systems in place, is this sufficient? <BR><BR>A58.  The Prime Contractor will be held responsible for the quality or their products and the system that assures that quality.<BR><BR>Q/C59.  PWS Paragraph 3.13.2 - Software - The contractor must maintain a software quality system.  Is the software quality system mandatory at the prime and/or subcontractor level?  If subcontractors have the applicable systems in place, is this sufficient?<BR><BR>A59.  The Prime Contractor will be held responsible for the quality or their products and the system that assures that quality.<BR><BR><BR>Q/C60.  PWS Paragraph 3.14 - Contract Management - We have been directed to establish a single focal point for all administrative, financial, and managerial aspects of this IDIQ.  Does this constitute a PMO and will these functions be setup as direct or indirect charges?<BR><BR>A60. This is for a single point of contact, not a PMO.<BR><BR>Q/C61.  PWS Paragraph 3.14.3 - Task Execution Plan - Are we required to submit "No Bid" notices? <BR><BR>A61.  No response will be taken as a no-bid.<BR><BR>Q/C62.  PWS Paragraph 3.14.3.1 - TEP Preparation for all Orders - It is directed that we prepare our submittals in MS Office.  We do this, but we PDF our submissions to the government.  This reduces their file sizes and prevents unauthorized changes.  Will the government accept submissions in this format?<BR><BR>A62.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C63.  PWS Paragraph 4.5.11 - Certification - Similar to the questions for Hardware and Software, are certifications required at the prime level? Or is subcontractor certification sufficient?<BR><BR>A63.  All certifications are managed at the system level; as such the Prime is responsible for all certifications.<BR><BR>Q/C64.  What is the expected date for release of the final RFP?<BR><BR>A64.  It is anticipated to be the Second Qtr of calendar year 2011.<BR><BR>Q/C65.  Will companies be allowed to participate on more than one team?<BR><BR>A65.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C66.  RE: Paragraph 3.14.12:  What is the Small Business (SB) subcontracting goal? In addition, what will be the percentage breakout between the different categories of SB?<BR><BR>A66.  That information will be contained in future DRAFT section L & M releases.<BR><BR>Q/C67.  RE: Paragraph 4.1:  What Task Areas will have Sample Task Orders?<BR><BR>A67.  The Government does not intend to release a draft version of the Sample Tasks.  No information regarding the sample tasks will be released prior to the final RFP.<BR><BR>Q/C68.  RE: Paragraph 4.1:  Will the government define what type of Sample Task Orders they expect to release with the RFP, for example SATCOM, etc.?<BR><BR>A68.  The Sample Tasks are representative of similar tasks that will be awarded under this contract however they sample tasks themselves will not be awarded. The Government does not intend to release a draft version of the Sample Tasks.  No information regarding the sample tasks will be released prior to the final RFP.<BR><BR>Q/C69  RE: Paragraph 3.2:  Is this a five (5) year base contract or are there option years?<BR><BR>A69.  This is a five year IDIQ each DO/TO will be competed and may have options associated with them.<BR><BR><BR>Q/C70.  RE: Paragraph 3.9:  Can the government provide a list of the companies that are OCI?<BR><BR>A70.  The government will not be providing a list of the companies that are OCI.<BR><BR>Q/C71.  RE: Paragraph 3.10:  Please define Non-Developmental Items (NDI)?<BR><BR>A71.  Per Federal Acquisition Regulation 2.101(b)(2) "Nondevelopmental item" means-<BR>(1) Any previously developed item of supply used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency, a State or local government, or a foreign government with which the United States has a mutual defense cooperation agreement; (2) Any item described in paragraph (1) of this definition that requires only minor modification or modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace in order to meet the requirements of the procuring department or agency; or (3) Any item of supply being produced that does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) or (2) solely because the item is not yet in use.<BR><BR>Q/C72.  RE: Paragraph 3.13.2:  Will the Prime be able to use their subcontractors CMMI ratings to meet this requirement? <BR><BR>A72.  Only if said subcontractor will definitely be utilized to provide the expected services in the future. <BR><BR>Q/C73.  RE: Paragraph 4.1.2:  Will the Government provide a list of GOTS equipment?<BR><BR>A73.  GOTS will be defined at the DO/TO level based on the requirements.  <BR><BR>2/8/2011 3:00 pm		Michelle Giller of Raytheon<BR><BR>Q/C 74.  Much of the equipment referred to is emphasized to be COTS products that are already on GSA and other government purchasing arrangements with standard pricing, etc. What is the role of the pricing to be provided under GTACS vs. other standing arrangements?<BR><BR>A74.  Because the GTACS contract will be a contract with a relatively broad scope that encompasses all aspects of hardware and support services in support of PEO C3T programs, although many of the items to be purchased will be COTs items, there will also be requirements for more sophisticated integrated COTS, GOTS and developmental items to fulfill specific needs.<BR><BR>Q/C75.  Paragraph 3.3.1 Technical Expert Status Accreditation (TESA) addresses only Korea. In general we have seen TESA mainly in discussions about Germany/Europe. Will GTACS have potential scope in Europe and thus will TESA apply there?<BR><BR>A75.  This Paragraph is currently under review.<BR><BR>Q/C76.  Paragraph 4.5.7, Leasing of Communication and Transmission Systems, Facilities, and Equipment, states that GTACS will have this included within its scope. Will there be a requirement to coordinate with extant contracts with similar scope currently managed by DISA for DoD-wide use?<BR><BR>A76.  There is the potential to manage interfaces to the GIG managed by DISA. <BR><BR><BR>The following answers are in response to questions from industry received as of 25 February 2011, 12:00 PM.<BR><BR>Q1.  Does the government still plan to release drafts of section L & M for the upcoming GTACS procurement?<BR><BR>A1.

<DESC>ATTACHED IS A DRAFT OF AN OCI CLAUSE SIMILAR TO WHAT WILL BE IN THE GLOBAL TACTICAL ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS (GTACS) SOLICITATION, AND SIMILAR TO THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) CLAUSE THAT WILL APPEAR IN MOST SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (SETA) SUPPORT CONTRACTS.<br>  <br>BECAUSE OF THE BROAD SCOPE OF THE GTACS CONTRACT AND SITUATIONS WHERE POTENTIAL OFFERORS CURRENTLY PROVIDE SETA SUPPORT SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT(S) OF INTEREST TO DEVELOP SUCH AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 9.5.<br>  <br>EACH OFFEROR SHOULD REVIEW FAR 9.5 AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE EXTENT WHICH SUCH AN OCI MAY ARISE BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION TO COMPETE FOR THE GTACS EFFORT.<br>  <br>H-1 52.6001 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST / MARCH 2011<br> <br>Specific fill-in information will be provided as appropriate on a Task Order basis.<br><br>(a) Definition.<br>Per FAR 2.101, an organizational conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the persons objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. It does not include the normal flow of benefits from incumbency.<br><br>(b) The Contracting Officer has determined that potentially significant organizational conflicts of interest may arise due to the nature of the work the Contractor will perform under this contract that may preclude the Contractor from being awarded future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts in a related area. Whereas the Contractor shall be ineligible to act as a prime contractor, consultant, or subcontractor to provide the equipment, items and services, it is agreed that the Contractor shall be ineligible to act as a prime contractor, consultant, or subcontractor to any prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier who is to supply the services, system or major components thereof for any project where the Contractor has provided or is providing support as described in FAR 9.5.<br><br>(c) The Contracting Officer may make a determination to allow a Contractor to participate in an acquisition subject to the submission of an acceptable mitigation plan in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) below. This determination may not be appealed.<br><br>(1) If the Contracting Officer requests, and the Contractor submits an organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan that, after Government review is acceptable to the Government, the Contractor's parent corporation, subsidiaries, or other physically separate profit and loss centers may not be precluded from acting as a subcontractor or consultant on future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts. The Government's determination regarding the adequacy of the mitigation plan or the possibility of mitigation are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the Government and are not subject to the Disputes clause of the contract. The Government may terminate the contract for default if the Contractor fails to implement and follow the procedures contained in any approved mitigation plan.<br><br>(2) Any mitigation plan shall include, at a minimum, non-disclosure agreements to be executed by the Contractor and the Contractors employees supporting the Government per paragraph (c) above. Items for consideration in a mitigation plan include the following: identification of the organizational conflict(s) of interest; reporting and tracking system; an organizational conflict of interest  compliance/enforcement plan, to include employee training and sanctions, in the event of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information; a plan for organizational segregation (e.g., separate reporting chains); and data security measures.<br><br>(d) These restrictions outlined in paragraph (b) shall apply to   - FILL IN --.  This clause shall remain in effect for one year after completion of this contract.<br><br>(e) The Contractor shall apply this clause to any subcontractors or consultants, who have access to information, participate in the development of data, or participate in any other activity related to this contract which is subject to terms of this clause at the prime contractor level, unless the Contractor includes an acceptable alternate subcontractor provision in its mitigation plan. For subcontractors or consultants under this contract, if an organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan is submitted and acceptable to the Government, the subcontractor's parent corporation, subsidiaries, or other physically separate profit and loss centers may not be precluded from acting as a prime, subcontractor, or consultant on future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts.<br><br>(f) The Contractor's employees shall be trained and informed of Subpart 9.5 of the FAR and this contract provision, and shall execute a Contractor-Employee Personal Financial Interest/Protection of Sensitive Information Agreement as appropriate.<br><br>(g) The Contactor agrees that it will use all reasonable diligence in protecting proprietary data received by it. The Contractor further agrees it will not willfully disclose proprietary data to unauthorized parties without the prior permission of the Government, and that proprietary data shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed, in whole or part, for any purpose other than to accomplish the contracted effort. This restriction does not limit the contractors right to use, duplicate or disclose such information if such information was lawfully obtained by the contractor from other sources.<br>  <br>(h) The Contractor agrees to enter into written agreements with all companies whose proprietary data it shall have access and to protect such data from unauthorized use or disclosure as long as it remains proprietary. The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer copies of these written agreements. The Contractor agrees to protect the proprietary data and rights of other organizations disclosed to the Contractor during performance of this contract with the same caution that a reasonably prudent Contractor would use to safeguard highly valuable property. The Contractor agrees to refrain from using proprietary information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.<br><br>(i) The Contractor shall not distribute reports, data or information of any nature arising from its performance under this contract, except as provided by this contract or as may be directed by the Contracting Officer.<br><br> (j) Government Representatives shall have access to the Contractors premises and the right to inspect all pertinent books and records in order to insure that the contractor is in compliance with FAR 9.5.<br><br>(k) The Contractor agrees that if after award it discovers a potential organizational conflict of interest, a prompt and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of the actions the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.<br><br>(l) The Government may waive application of this clause when it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to do so.<br><br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information.  <br>Contracting Office: <br> <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND (C4ISR)<br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                 Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist              Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief   Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>The following answers are in response to questions from industry received as of 25 March 2011.<br><br>Q1.  Do you have any news on the anticipated DRAFT RFP release of the Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems opportunity?<br><br>A1.  The anticipated release date for the DRAFT RFP has not yet been determined.  A DRAFT of sections L&M and the Past Performance Questionnaire were posted to Army Single Face to Industry and FedBizOpps on 25 March 2011.<br><br>Q2.  Draft PWS Paragraph 4.1.1, Task Area 1 - Development: this paragraph indicates that work will be development work and will be performed by the system development contractor. Would task orders issued under this Task Area be considered exempt from the OCI Provisions in the contract pursuant to FAR 9.505-2(a)(3)?<br><br>A2. No<br><br>Q3.  Will that exemption be identified in individual RTEPs and awarded Task Orders?<br><br>A3. No<br><br>Q4.  Does the information technology requirement for this program (solicitation # W15P7T11RC001) include secure remote connectivity and/or secure file transfer capabilities between Windows based servers and other Windows and non Windows clients/devices.<br><br>A4.  The Government has a requirement to transmit and receive information up to and including the Secret level. The Design, Execution and Implementation of that requirement will be a function of the individual offeror's proposal.  The Government is providing no further guidance on this topic as it wants to encourage creative solutions that bring additional value to each offeror's proposal.<br><br>Q5.  Has a decision been made on what specific contracting vehicle PEO C3T will use for these IDIQs?<br><br>A5.  Please refer to Section 3.1, Contract Type, of the DRAFT PWS posted on18 Jan 2011.<br><br>Q6.   Is the anticipated final RFP timeframe still the second quarter of 2011?<br><br>A6.  Yes<br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information.  <br><br>Contracting Office: <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND (C4ISR)<br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                  Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist               Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief    Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>Answers to Question from Industry, SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following answers are in response to questions from industry received as of 06 May 2011.<br><br>Q1.  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), will the Government provide that contractor a fair opportunity to bid the low rate/full rate production work should a requirement exist for that production work? <br><br>A1.  How the Government will solicit the Delivery Orders will be forthcoming in the RFP and will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).<br>   <br>Q2.  Does the Government envision that this process could be streamlined by including all facets of the life cycle support in a single task order, particularly for ACAT programs?<br><br>A2.  The Government does not anticipate a single task order covering all aspects of the life cycle support of a system.  However, there may be extraordinary circumstances where a single task order covering all aspects of the life cycle support of a system is released.  Such a requirement will require the contracting officer approval and at this point the Government cannot predict the circumstances of such a release.<br><br>Q3.  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. . an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), can that contractor bid follow-on work that is a formal ACAT program (a new separate RFP, not GTACS related) where the performance requirements of the system to be designed and produced were proven to be feasible in the prototype system developed under GTACS?<br><br>A3.  The Government cannot answer this question as it relates to future contract opportunities not related to this solicitation.<br>   <br>Q4.  In this case the GTACS prime should be able to avoid work that creates elements of the new ACAT program RFP - SOW, CLIN structure, test strategy, etc.  Again, will the Government use a set of SETA contractors to develop any / all procurement data packages for these scenarios?<br><br>A4.  Please Clarify<br><br>Q5.  I am looking for the whole draft solicitation for GTACS W15P7T11RC001; I only get sections L and M.<br><br>A5.  Please refer to Answer 1 posted to FedBizOpps on 28 March 2011.<br><br>Q6.  Can the Government provide guidance on how many Offeror past performances (e.g., minimum and maximum number) will be required?<br><br>A6.  Please refer to the DRAFT Sections L and M, Pg 4, first paragraph, (ii) Volume II-Past Performance (factor) posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) and FedBizOpps on 25 March 2011.  Updates to DRAFT Sections Land M will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q7.  If an Offeror proposes with major subcontractors, can the Government provide guidance on how many major subcontractor past performances (e.g., minimum and maximum number) will be required?<br><br>A7.  Please refer to the DRAFT Sections L and M, Pg 6, [2], (c), posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) and FedBizOpps on 25 March 2011.  Updates to DRAFT Sections Land M will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q8.  Draft Sec. L.2.c.ii.e Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire indicates that the Questionnaire is to be returned to the Offeror for inclusion with the proposal. On the last page of the Questionnaire the respondent is instructed to return the completed Questionnaire to the Contracting Officer. Can the Government please clarify the instructions regarding respondents' return of completed Questionnaires?<br><br>A8.  Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire(s) are to be returned first from the POC to the Offeror for inclusion with the proposal.  Proposals will then be submitted at the appropriate RFP closing date.  Updates to the Draft Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q9.  For work performed as a subcontractor, we have found that the Government contracting officer / COR / COTR are often unwilling to provide past performance responses for a subcontractor. For work performed as a subcontractor, will the Government allow the Offeror to request Questionnaires be completed by the prime contractor's POC and by the prime contractor's technical representative (often a project or program manager)?<br><br>A9.  Yes<br><br>Q10.  Can the Government advise when they anticipate issuing attachment 4 for pricing purposes?<br><br>A10.  The Government does not intend to release a draft version of attachment 4.  The attachments will be released with the final RFP.<br><br>Q11.  Is there an incumbent contract and if so, what is the contract number?<br><br>A11.  No<br><br>Q12.  Should I expect a Q&A document to be released with this information in the future, or should I not expect an answer?<br><br>A12.  Yes, all questions from industry will be posted to FedBizOpps.<br><br>Q13.  What date do you have set for the Industry Date?<br><br>A13.  At this time, the Government has no plans for another Industry day.<br><br>Q14.  The ASFI (Response Deadline) and the FBO.gov (Response Date) have different dates. The ASFI shows 5/5/2011 and the FBO.gov shows 5/12/2011. Which is the proper due date?<br><br>A14.  The proper date is 12 May 2011.<br><br>Q15.  What do the response date citations refer to as the material that is due?<br><br>A15.  The date listed as a response date is for system purposes only.  The synopsis is an informational notice and there is no required response at this time.<br><br>Q16.  The 4/21/2011 Synopsis notice at FBO.gov states "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted."  This suggests that the Government will make no material or significant change in the final RFP as compared to what is already published for the solicitation as of 4/21/2011. Is that an accurate assumption on which one can base an early submission of proposal?<br><br>A16. No, that is not an accurate assumption.  The posted Sections L and M are drafts, as identified in the document.  The final RFP is forthcoming.<br><br>Q17.  Is it possible to schedule an in-person demonstration of our technology to those involved and/or responsible for this pre-solicitation?<br><br>A17.  Please refer to Q10 and A10 posted to FedBizOpps 06 January 2011.<br><br>Q18.  What specific information/materials, and in what format, can be deliver now to you and/or those responsible for this pre-solicitation?<br><br>A18.  Questions may be forwarded by e-mail to the points of contact listed below.<br><br>Q19.  Do we need to be on the GSA or have an existing government contract to participate in this solicitation?<br><br>A19.  No<br><br>Q20.  If schedule an in-person demonstration of our technology is unfeasible, how can we arrange for no-cost on-line brief demo of our product to interested government technical representatives?<br><br>A20.  Please refer to Q10 and A10 posted to FedBizOpps 06 January 2011.<br><br>Q 21 In accordance with the statement included in the posting of April 21, 2011 please clarify if the Government is requesting and accepting early submission of proposals and information at this time; and in advance of the issuance of the final solicitation and task orders.<br><br>A21. The Government is not accepting proposals at this time and will only accept proposals once the final RFP has been issued.<br><br>Q22.  The statement included in this posting "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted." implies the opportunity is available for the industry to submit proposals, capability statements, and information under this requirement which may be included and evaluated at the time of the final solicitation.<br><br>A22.  The Government is not accepting proposals at this time and will only accept proposals once the final RFP has been issued.<br><br><br>Q23. Our company submitted its response to your Request for Information (RFI) on January 1, 2011.  Please advise if additional information is desired and requested at this time.<br><br>A23. Additional information is not required at this point in time.<br><br>Q 24. In cases where a subcontractor on a GTACS Team is based out of Canada and has a subsidiary created for the purposes of conducting business with the U.S.  Government, where the subcontractor's rates and cost build-up formulas are typically audited by the Canadian Commercial Corp. (CCC) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), will the requirement for submission of that subcontractor's proprietary cost information "sealed data" through an Army web site be waived, and normal CCC submission of the proprietary data be acceptable.<br><br>A 24.  The contractor's forward pricing rate proposal, disclosed practices, and proposal methodology for the GTACS effort should be consistent.    <br><br>Q 25. Please advise if the Government is planning to provide responses to all the questions submitted to date under this effort.<br>A25. The Government does plan to respond to all industry questions.<br><br>Q26. Does the Government plan to issue a pipeline of the RTEPs planned for release to include Scope of Work, location and anticipated release date after award of the IDIQ vehicle?<br>A26. The Government plans to award many Delivery and Task Orders under this contract over the next 5 years. <br><br>Q27. Will IDIQ contract holders have the opportunity to make site visits prior to RTEP release, especially for efforts requiring construction?<br>A27. Depending on the requirements for individual DO/TOs issued under the GTACS contract, the Offeror will have the ability to make site visits.<br><br>Q28. We would like to respond to this draft solicitation; however the three task orders are not listed.  Could you possibly allow us to view the complete solicitation with the sample task orders or direct us to a location to view them? <br>A28. The sample tasks will be part of the final RFP.<br><br>Q29.I wanted to follow up with a request for a possible schedule; and the timeline you are planning to post responses to questions submitted to date on the GTACS effort.<br>A29.  Question will be responded to as they are submitted and as the answers are available.<br><br>Q30. Reference:  PWS Section 3.6 Personnel - The Contractor shall provide personnel having security clearances up to TOP SECRET, or as identified in applicable DO/TO.  Will the Government consider revising requirement to TS-SCI in order to broaden the contract to allow TS-SCI efforts to be competed under the contract.<br>A30.  The contracting officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information. <br><br>Contracting Office: <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND <br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                  Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist               Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief    Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>The following are responses to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of May 13, 2011, 1500 Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q1: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a)  - " The Offeror shall submit a Microsoft 2007 Excel file (workbook) that calculates and includes the formulas necessary to develop a summary worksheet (single tab within workbook) which provides the 'Summary of Total Price by Cost Element by CLIN by WBS'." <br><br>Does the Government intend to provide an Excel 2007 workbook with the final RFP that is formatted in the manner that the Government wishes to receive the Cost/Pricing data as described in this section?<br><br>R1: YES<br><br>Q2: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a)  - "..This 'Summary of Total Price by Cost  Element by CLIN by WBS' worksheet will have for each Cost Element a reference to a worksheet (single tab within workbook) containing the supporting calculations, formulas, and line item details necessary for the government to evaluate the individual components of the Cost Element by CLIN by Fiscal Year and by WBS. (See Attachment 4 - workbook)<br><br>Will the Government provide the referenced workbook in Attachment 4 with the Final RFP?  <br><br>R2: YES<br><br>Q3: If so, does this workbook include detail worksheet and structure for each Cost Element as requested in the referenced paragraph?  <br><br>R3: YES<br><br>Q4: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a) ii. Direct Material (2nd paragraph) - "Each priced summary will include the part number once with the total proposed number of units for the WBS". <br><br>Will the Government please explain the requirement to "...include the part number once"?  Is the Government expecting a single part number for each level of the WBS, of which the required part will be defined in the Final RFP?  Or does the Government want a collapsed Bill of Materials by Part Number with quantities of each for each level of the WBS?<br><br>R4: The Government requires a collapsed Bill of Materials by Part Number with quantities of each for each level of the WBS.<br><br>Q5: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a) v. Indirect Costs - "...For each Indirect Cost (example Fringe, Overhead, Material/Subcontract Handling, General and Administrative, Facilities Capital Cost of Money, etc.,) identify the indirect rates from your Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or forward Pricing Rate Proposal (FPRP) applied to each respective Cost Element that were used to calculate the Indirect Costs."<br><br>Will the Government accept a Forward Pricing Rate Proposal that defines Activity Rates (not separated into overhead, fringe, etc.) as an adequate submission for this requirement?<br><br>R5: No, the Government requires the offeror to propose indirect rates on an individual basis.  <br><br>Q6: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(d) - " The offeror shall submit a sanitized version of the Excel files detailed in paragraphs A, B, and C. NO PRICE DATA (RATES/SUMMARY DOLLARS) shall be included in the SANITIZED Files."<br><br>Will the Government please provide more detail on the data that will need to be excluded in the "sanitized" version?  <br><br>R6: All monetary values must be excluded.<br><br>Q7: Will the Government please provide detail of what data should be included in the sanitized files?<br><br>R7:  Everything excluding all monetary values. <br><br>Q8: Reference page 3, Table 1.  We assume there will be one (1) file for the Technical Volume that will contain:<br><br>Table of Contents for all information in the Technical Volume including Sample Task 1, 2, and 3 and not a separate Table of Contents for each.  Is this correct? <br><br>R8: YES<br><br>Q9: Will attachments such as Block Diagrams, Equipment Specification Sheets, be counted in the page count?<br><br>R9:  Any information the Offeror feels necessary to accurately describe its response to the final RFP should be included and all information will be considered as part of the page count. <br><br>Q10: Reference page 3, Paragraph 2, Page Count.  How will the number of lines per page be determined? Word will indicate line numbers: however, spaces are counted as well. Draft Section L, 2 Proposal Files, b, page 3<br><br>R10: The Government will use Word format to count the number of lines. Draft section L 2. Proposal files, paragraph 2 defines the amount of spacing to be provided and only TEXT will be removed.<br><br>Q11: Will the table of contents be included as part of the page count for the Technical and Past Performance Volumes?  Will a cover page and other informational list (list of figures, list of tables, list of acronyms, etc.) count in the total number of allowed pages?<br><br>R11:  The table of contents does not count as part of the page count<br>Lists of figure, tables and acronyms do not count as part of the page count.<br><br>Q12: Draft Section L, (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6<br>The Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires are to be included in the proposal Past Performance file.  Will these pages count in the total number of allowed pages?<br><br>R12: Per Draft Section L (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6, the completed questionnaires will not be counted as part of the total page count.  In addition the Questionnaires will no longer be the Offerors responsibility.<br><br>Q13:  Regarding OCI, can a prime bidder exclude itself from individual RTEPs/Task Orders if it feels there would be a conflict of interest on that particular Task Order?<br><br>R13: Yes<br><br>Q14:  Small Business Participation Plan.  Is a Small Business Participation Plan to be submitted only for each of the Sample Tasks or is a Small Business Participation Plan also required for the overall IDIQ total effort?  If also required for the total IDIQ effort what values should be used for plan figures.  The same questions also arise for large businesses required to also submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan.<br><br>R14:   The SB plan is for the overall effort - not for each individual Sample Task.<br><br>Q15:  Pricing.  Your instruction is for offerors to submit "Cost, Cost Plus, and Firm-Fixed Prices for its proposed notional systems/equipment in response to the three Sample Tasks provided with the RFP".  Is this to be understood as requiring three proposals for each of the Sample Tasks or will each task have a specified contract type associated with it?<br><br>R15:  No, only one proposal is to be submitted. There will be only one type of contract for each sample task which will be provided in the final RFP. <br><br>Q16: Pricing.  Is it acceptable to submit a Word document Price Volume along with the Excel spreadsheet which contains the requested supporting information? Can the Word document submission include printouts of the pricing file worksheets to accompany explanations of the basis used to develop the pricing?  Is a sanitized version of the Word document Volume desired along with the sanitized Excel spreadsheet?<br><br>R16: No- see pricing proposal instructions provided in the draft  L&M , in addition a sanitized version of all submittals must be provided. <br><br>Q17: Pricing. The instructions refer to preparing pricing for each Cost Element by Fiscal Year.  Is the fiscal year being referred here the Government fiscal year or the offeror's fiscal year?<br><br>R17: For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure  (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed.<br><br>Q18: Reference: draft M.C.3.b explains how the total evaluated price shall be calculated by multiplying the evaluated proposed price for each Sample Task by a weighted multiplier.  It also states "Based on historical data and future projections for task orders over the life of the base contract, each multiplier represents the relative contribution of the work in each Sample Task to the overall effort."<br><br>The multiplier for STO3 is .20, which indicates that historical data and future projections for Sustainment are set at 20% of the total effort.  However, in the Q&A released on 16 February 2011, the Government stated:<br><br>Q/C52. What is the expected mix of Material Purchase vs. Services provided? During Industry day in July 2010, the KO had announced a 60% Material and a 40% Services mix. Will this stay the same of some other anticipated mix?<br> <br>R18: The mix and percentages will be clarified as part of the final RFP.<br><br>Q19: Recommend that the government adjust the STO 3 multiplier to .30 and reduce the multipliers for STO 1 and/or STO 2 to more accurately reflect the anticipated 70%-30% mix of Material and Service.<br><br>R19: The contracting officer will take this under consideration. <br><br>Q20: Volume I Technical<br>1.) Reference: Draft PWS (released 14 January 2011) Section 3.14.3 states "Unless otherwise specified by the Government, the TEP size shall not exceed twenty (20) total text pages."  However, the table in Draft L Section 2.b shows a 30 page limit for STO 1, 25 pages per STO 2, and 25 pages for STO 3.<br>Question: Please confirm that the government is requesting a 20 page TEP for each STO.  And if so, what information should be included in the 10 additional pages for STO 1 and 5 additional pages for STO 2 and STO 3?<br><br>R20: Refer to Draft Section L proposal submission instructions table 2<br><br>Q21: Reference: Draft L.2.c Part (i) VOLUME I - TECHNICAL states "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3." Question: Please clarify if a separate Executive Summary is required for each Sample Task response.<br><br>R21: A single Executive Summary shall be provided addressing brief overview of the entire proposal to include the Sample Tasks.   Executive Summary section is included as part of the overall page count.<br><br>Q22: Volume II Past Performance<br>1.) Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "For all contracts identified in Section 1, Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires must be completed and submitted with the Offeror's proposal submission."<br>Question: Please confirm that the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires do not count toward the total page limitation as specified for Volume II (Past Performance) per section L?<br><br>R22:  Per draft section L (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6, the completed questionnaires will not be counted as part of the total page count.  In addition the Questionnaires will no longer be the Offerors responsibility.<br><br>Q23: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "Sections 1 & 2 of this file shall contain the Offeror's description of all Government and commercial contracts (prime contracts and subcontracts awarded or ongoing within three years prior to the date of issuance of this solicitation) that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation."<br>Question: Will the government consider a page limit applied per reference (Section 1 & 2) to help ensure a more consistent evaluation of references between all offerors?  (Note that, by itself, the 50 page limit for Volume II may result in reference descriptions of different lengths, depending on how many references an offeror submits.)<br><br>R23: The Government Contracting Officer will take this recommendation under consideration.<br><br>Q24: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "Relevancy is defined as those development, production and sustainment tasks defined in the PWS and sample tasks attached to the RFP include efforts similar in complexity and technology to the GTACS Contract."<br>Question: This definition of relevancy is not clear.  We suggest the government rephrase to "Relevancy is defined as similar in scope to the tasks defined in the PWS and sample tasks attached to the RFP, and similar in complexity and technology to the GTACS Contract."<br><br>R24: The definition of Relevancy will be revised in the final RFP to make it clearer.<br><br>Q25: Volume III Small Business Participation Plan<br>1.) Reference: In accordance with DFARS 215.304, both large and small businesses are required to submit a Small Business Participation Plan.  As such, draft section L requires Offerors to include "Business Development (BD) Program" companies in their SBPP.<br>Question: Please confirm that the "Business Development (BD) Program" referenced in Draft Section L is the same as the 8(a) program referenced in Draft Section M.<br><br>R25: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP. <br><br>Q26:  Reference: Draft L.2.c part (iv) - VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN includes a matrix to propose Small Business Participation Goals.<br>Question: What is the government's definition of "Total Contract Value" as it relates to completing this matrix?<br><br>R26: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP.<br><br>Q27: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (iv) - VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN includes a separate matrix to demonstrate HBCU/MI target participation.<br>Question: Please confirm the Government's intent to require the utilization of HBCU/MI organizations as part of the offeror's Small Business Participation Plan per draft section L. And if so, how will they be evaluated since they are not currently mentioned in Draft Section M?<br><br>R27: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP.<br><br>Q28: Reference:  Draft Section L.2.c(ii) VOLUME II-PAST PERFORMANCE (FACTOR)<br><br>Question:  Please clarify the requirement for the "Sections 1 & 2 of this file shall contain the Offeror's description of all Government and commercial contracts (prime contracts and subcontracts awarded or ongoing within three years prior to the date of issuance of this solicitation) that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. <br><br>Does the Government intend for offeror's to submit all their contracts, which will be hundreds, or does the Government intend to request three - five of the most relevant?  <br><br>R28: There are no limits to the number of contracts that can be submitted; However the Offeror should use their best judgment with regards to recent and relevant data.<br><br>Q29: Will teaming partners/subcontractors be required to submit all their contracts within three years?<br><br>R29: Refer to submission instruction in draft Section L<br><br>Q30: Will past performance questionnaires be required for all submitted past performance references?<br><br>R30: The collection of Past performance questionnaires will now be the responsibility of the Government in the final RFP. <br><br>Q31: The government has requested that the Cost/Proposal in "Volume IV - Cost-Price (Factor)" be provided in the form of a Microsoft 2007 Excel file which shall include the detail data and calculations building to the submitted pricing.  In lieu of a Microsoft 2007 Excel file, will the government consider submission of the Cost Element supporting data and calculations in the form of reporting from an industry standard government costing and pricing software tool such as ProPricer which utilizes source data (including indirect rates) that tie to an Offeror's FPRP (and which such reporting has historically been used and relied upon by DCAA), rather than requiring the development and use of a manual Excel model that would be both less efficient and allow for more potential for human error?<br><br>R31: The Offer shall utilize the spread sheets provided by the government. <br><br>Q32: Will the workbook referred to as "Attachment 4-workbook" be required to be used for the Offeror's submission to the government, and if so, will it be provided to potential Offerors prior to the release of the RFP in order for the prospective Offerors to prepare to best administer their proposal efforts towards completion of the workbook in the format of such workbook?<br><br>R32: The workbook will be released with the final RFP.<br><br>Q33: Request clarification on the organization of the Past Performance volume.  Does each contract submitted for past performance contain a Section 1 & 2 (meaning Section 1 & 2 repeat for each past performance contract), or is there only one Section 1 and one Section 2 that respectively contain Contract Description and Performance information for all relevant contracts?<br><br>R33: Each contract shall have its own section 1&2<br><br>Q34: Ref Section Draft L.2.c(ii)(c) - A "major subcontractor" is one that performs "more than 20% of the total proposed price".  Please confirm the "total proposed price" is the summation of the proposed prices for each Sample Task, not the total evaluated price or contract value.  <br><br>R34: Total proposed price will be utilized.<br><br>Q35: Ref Section Draft L.2.c(ii)(c) - Is the outline of work assignments (provided in Section 3) limited to subcontractors that perform more than 20% of the total proposed price, or does it include all proposed subcontractors?  Are the work assignments limited to the Sample Tasks or do they cover the entire contract PWS scope?<br><br>R35: The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q36: Please confirm that all proposed subcontractors performing less than 20% of the total proposed price are not required to submit past performance, or questionnaires.<br><br>R36: That is correct<br><br>Q37: Draft Section L.2.c(ii)(e) states that Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires are to be completed (Parts I and II) and returned to the Offeror for inclusion in their proposal.  However, Part III in the Questionnaire requires the completed document be returned to the Contracting Officer in the cover letter.  Please clarify how completed questionnaires will be submitted to the GTACS source selection team.  Typically, completed questionnaires are not returned to the Offeror.  <br><br>R37: The questionnaires will be returned to the Contracting Officer or specialist as will be stated in the final RFP.<br> <br>Q38: Please clarify the correct title of Volume II - is it Past Performance Risk, Past Performance (Factor) or Past Performance?  <br><br>R38: Past Performance<br><br>Q39: In reference to Draft Section L & M, Page 4 - (ii) Volume II - Past Performance (Factor), we view a discrepancy between the definition of "relevancy" and the page limit of 50 pages.  Will the Government please clarify that the Offeror will be allowed to determine which of its contracts and which of its Major Subcontractor's contracts are relevant to this effort in light of a limited page count?<br><br>R39: Please refer to R28.<br><br>Q40: In reference to Draft Section L & M, Page 13 - Cost Price (Factor) iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort - A listing of individual Subcontract/ Interdivisional Efforts (S/IE) identifying the company and its specific division or segment with its corresponding cost by Contractor Fiscal Year. Note: The prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all sub/interdivisional costs $700K and over.  In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data, will the Government please clarify which FAR Clause(s) are applicable here?  Will the Government please clarify if this reference includes commercial suppliers? <br><br>We view a discrepancy between the nature of the GTACS competition and FAR 15.403-1 Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing, which describes an exemption for providing cost and pricing data for COTS suppliers in occasions of adequate price competition.  Will the Government please clarify its intent?<br>FAR 15.403-1 Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing requires that the Prime Contractor provide Certified Pricing in order to flow that requirement down to Subcontractors.  Section L and M do not require the Prime to submit certified pricing.  Will the Government please clarify this request? <br><br>R40: For purposes of the evaluation of the source selection, no certified cost or pricing data will be required as part of an offeror's submission, however, the Government reserves the right to request 'other than cost and pricing data' if required at either the evaluation of sample tasks or during evaluation of future DO/TOs.<br><br>Q41: In Draft Section L & M, Page 19 - c. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Performance Risk - Will the Government please provide referenced Section IV?<br><br>R41: This reference has been deleted from the final RFP.   <br><br>Q42: In Draft Section L & M, Page 17 - PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION APPROACH <br>"A major subcontractor is defined as one who will be providing hardware, software or services those subcontract is for more than 20% of the total proposed price."  If the Sample Task Order requires more that 20% of a vendor's COTS hardware, will that vendor then qualify as a "major subcontractor" and will the Government require Past Performance from that vendor in the Past Performance volume?  Or will the Offeror be able to treat said vendor as a commercial component supplier?  <br><br>R42: The vendor is considered a major subcontractor and will be required to provide Past Performance data.<br><br>Q43: Will the Government require certified pricing from that vendor if the total dollar amount is over $700K?  <br><br>R43: Please refer to R40.<br><br>Q44: Draft L.2b, "File Packaging"; p3<br>Question/Comment:  <br>There appears to be a disconnect between the Sample Task response format preparation instruction in Draft Section L and the Task Execution Plan (TEP) contents defined in the Draft PWS in paragraph 3.14.3 (and its two sub-paragraphs 3.14.3.1, 3.14.3.2, and 3.14.3).  Please clarify.<br><br>R44: For the RFP follow the instructions in Sections L&M.  For future DOs/TOs follow the instructions as outlined in the PWS.    <br><br>Q45: Draft L.2c (iv), VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR); p7<br>Question/Comment:  <br>Will the Government recognize and give credit to a Prime's subcontracting to its SDB Partners who are not 8(a) Business Development Program participants as expressed in its Small Business Subcontracting Participation Plan?	<br>Rationale: Restricting small business participation credit to 8a Business Development Program small businesses ignores the larger community of Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB).   The current wording implies the SDB category at the top level are not counted.<br><br>R45: Yes, the Government will recognize and gave credit to a Prime's subcontracting to its SDB partners who are not 8(a) Business Development Program participants.  <br><br>Q46: Draft L.2c, "Content Requirements"; p3<br>Question/Comment:	<br>Please state if the "Summary Section" of the proposal files is the same as the summaries defined under 3.14.3 in the draft PWS released in January, 2011.  <br>Rationale: This will help us understand more fully what information is requested by the Government by this part of Section L.<br><br>R46:   Please refer to R21.<br>  <br>Q47: Draft L.2c(ii)(c), "Section 3 - Subcontracts"; page 6<br>Question/Comment:<br>Within the Section L Past Performance volume and the Section M Past Performance Evaluation, we recommend that the government clarify the definition of Major Subcontractor (>20%) to be based upon the price of each Sample Task taken alone, as opposed to the sum of the three (3) Sample Tasks price taken together.  We want to avoid a situation that is too restrictive.  For example, a subcontractor performing >20% of effort on Sample Task #1 may not be >20% of the total price for three Sample Tasks combined.  <br>Rationale:<br>With three disparate sample tasks, it is possible that individual Major Subcontractors would not have a high level of proficiency for all three task areas.  If bound to (>20%) for a given Major Subcontractor as a sum of the three Sample Tasks, the Prime Contractor would be limited on the number of Major Subcontractors included in the Sample Task responses, which would limit who the prime contractor can use for Past Performance citations.  If prime contractors have to weigh the value of a subcontractor's past performance against the best technical solution for each sample task, the unintended consequence to the Government could result in responses that do not deliver the Best Value solution that is desired.<br><br>R47:  The Government Contracting Officer will take this recommendation under consideration. <br><br>Q48:  Draft L.2c (iv)(b), "Table entry row F"; p9<br>Question/Comment:<br>The emphasis on HBCU/MI subcontracting in Section L seems disconnected from the intent of the small business goals under the GTACS PWS/RFP.<br>Rationale:<br>College/University participation typically involves basic science research and technology development. The GTACS three task areas of system Development, Production & Deployment and Sustainment typically do not require College/University participation.   <br><br>R48: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration. <br><br>Q49: Question/Comment:<br>The ability of an Offeror's team (total composition) to adequately cover the breadth of tasking in the PWS does not appear to be a consideration.  Section M as currently written only evaluates the team composition on the Sample Tasks.  While the final team composition may have no direct bearing on the sample tasks, an Offeror needs to be responsive to the PWS elements.  It is suggested that a team assessment matrix similar to that below be considered as part of the offering.<br>Rationale:<br>The GTACS PWS paragraph 1.0 "Scope" emphasizes the requirement for the Prime and his Team to address all Hardware, Systems and Services aspects defined in PWS paragraphs 4.1 through 4.5.   <br><br>Table x.  PWS Capability Matrix<br>PWS Category - GTACS Prime - GTACS Partners<br><br>R49: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q50: Draft L.2c (iv)(b), "Small Business Participation Goals"; p7-9<br>Question/Comment:<br>On page 7 in 3rd paragraph under (b), the letter designations used in the narrative do not match the letter designations in the table. 	<br>Rationale:<br>Questions in the final RFP will be reduced if this minor clerical error is rectified. <br><br>R50: In the final RFP, the matrix will be deleted, and will be replaced with clear instructions on the Small Business Participation Plan.<br><br> Q51: Draft L.2c(iv)(d), "HBCU/MI Target Participation"; p11<br>Question/Comment:<br>NAICS Codes are only requested for HBCU/MI subcontractors and not the rest of the small business sub-categories.   NAICS Codes for all Team Partners should be of interest to the Government so that the proposal evaluators know that a Prime Offeror is working with small businesses with GTACS relevant NAICS Codes to perform work under this contract.<br><br>R51: In the final RFP, participation breakout by NAICS will be required for all Small Business Sub-Categories.<br><br>Q52: Draft L.2c(iii), VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR); p3, 12 & 14<br>Question/Comment:<br>Similar RFPs in the past have included a template for a cost file that had a defined template.  Will the government define a template for bidders to complete for the cost volume?  <br>Should there also be a filename entitled "Cost.xlsx" or even a series of filenames ending in .xlsx for the three separate cost spreadsheets referenced as (a), (b), and (c) above?<br>Rationale:<br>In iii VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR) in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (d), it is required to be submitted in Microsoft 2007 Excel files in the proposal.  However, in Proposal Files in Table 1 for the Volume IV Price, it states the file name is to be Cost.doc.<br><br> R52: A template will be provided.<br><br>Q53: Question/Comment:<br>A review of the suggested proposal volumes does not appear to adequately consider or evaluate an Offeror's ability to manage a diverse team and effectively deliver solutions on the Task Orders.  A  "Management" volume or section would allow discussion of Program Management activities, contract management, execution management and overall subcontract management and  provide the Government with additional insight and will reduce contract risk by eliminating "surprises"- i.e., execution impacts in cost and schedule that are otherwise unforeseen or unreported until they become issues.<br>Rationale:<br>Management of the contract and individual task orders including schedule and cost status are important aspects to consider when choosing a contractor.<br><br>R53: The contracting officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q54:  Draft L.2c(i)," Content Requirements, Tech Volume"; p3,4	<br>Question/Comment:<br>Draft Sections L&M do not appear to give relevance to, or generally track with, the Draft PWS.  In one example, the TEP Summaries under 3.14.3 of the Draft PWS suggest that bidders include price but the Draft L&M state that Vol I shall not include any price data.  Please clarify. <br><br>R54:  The exclusion of price/cost information from other parts of the Offeror's proposal is to maintain the integrity of the technical evaluation. Subsequent to the initial contract award, the TEPs will follow the general preparation instructions set forth in the PWS with detailed information contained in each RTEP.  Please refer to R44.  <br><br>Q55:  Draft L.2c(iv), "VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR)";  p7<br>Question/Comment:<br>The current descriptions and evaluation criteria only appear to give consideration to the Small Business partners identified and incorporated into the Sample Task responses (non-awarded).  It is suggested that insight into an Offer's team composition would benefit the Government by demonstrating the Offer's commitment to small businesses on their GTACS Team who are not participating in any of the three (3) Sample Tasks.<br>Rationale:<br>Full team composition for executing an IDIQ contract can be an important factor in determining who can offer the best solutions.<br><br>R55:  Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) will be evaluated separately from sample tasks.  SBPP must address team composition and the team make up to ensure full understanding of the total scope of the effort, to including enforceable commitment.  <br><br>Q56:  Draft L. (iv) VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR); p11 and SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS; C. EVALUATION APPROACH; 4.  SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN EVALUATION APPROACH.  P19<br>Question/Comment:<br>We request the government eliminate the term "enforceable commitment" and eliminate the additional weighting given to "enforceable commitment".  <br>Rationale:<br>As previously stated by the Government, each delivery order will be unique in nature.  As such, there is no way to know what requirements will be on future GTACS Task or Delivery Orders. Therefore, it is not possible to "commit" specific work share or scope to any sub-contractor.  If this was done, the prime contractor would be forced to propose Task or Delivery Order responses that might not provide the government with the best technical solution or the best value solution.  This also restricts fair competition within the prime contractor team.  The decision of which combination of small businesses will provide the best value solution to the government should be made based on the unique requirements of each Task or Delivery Order.<br><br>R56: The Government does not intend to eliminate the term "enforceable commitment, Enforceable commitment serves as a mean to ensure Small Business participation and as a deterrent from switching Small Business team members without the approval of the Contracting Officer and the Chief Associate Director of CECOM Small Business.<br><br>Q57: Please confirm that a winning prime will not be allowed to bring on additional sub-contractors following an award.<br><br>R57: The winning Prime will be allowed to bring additional Subcontractors on following the award.

Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort -a listing of individual Subcontract/ Interdivisional Efforts (S/IE) identifying the company and its specific division or segment with its corresponding cost by Contractor Fiscal Year. Note: The prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all sub/interdivisional costs $700K and over.  In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data. <br><br>Question :  Current Draft Sections L and M do not appear to require the proposed prime to certify to cost or pricing data as this is a competitive procurement and 15.403-1(b)(4) would apply.  However, the language above appears to require subcontractors above $700,000 to provide certified cost or pricing data.  This appears to be an inconsistency.  Please clarify the Government's intent. <br><br>R75: Please refer to R40.  The following sentence will not be included in the final RFP, "In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data."<br><br>Q76:  If the Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort above should stand, please also consider the following:  The time required to obtain certified cost and pricing data will probably exceed the 30 day response time frame.  Pursuits that require the Offeror to obtain certified cost and pricing data often make that data due to the Government after proposal submission but before contract award to allow sufficient time for the effort involved.    Will the Government please consider revising the scope of this requirement or providing additional time for submission of this data?<br><br>R76: Please refer to R40.  This information will be reflected in the final RFP.<br><br>Q77:  Draft PWS Draft PWS Reference:  N/A<br><br>Question:  Will the government provide a Draft RFP prior to the release of the final RFP?<br><br>R77: See response to Q72<br><br>Q78:  Draft PWS Draft PWS Reference:  N/A<br><br>Question:  According to Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) the GTACS RFP is anticipated to be released 2QCY11.  Since we are half-way through the second quarter of this calendar year, does the Government anticipate the RFP release to be pushed into the third quarter of 2011?  If not will the RFP be issued in June?<br><br>R78:  See response to Q72<br><br>Q79:  The Draft Section L and M for the Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services Solicitation has been reviewed and we would like to request clarification on the following:  Since the contracting officer will take under consideration "...broaden the contract to allow TS-SCI efforts to be competed under the contract." (Q30 on 5/12/2011), will the Gov also consider receiving a classified submission as it relates to TS-SCI past Performance? <br><br>R79: The contracting office will take this under consideration<br><br>Q80:  The Gov response to Q/C's received as of 16 February 2011 responded to Q/C Q34, with A34 "Construction will not be part of this contract and all references will be removed from the PWS."  Recent response to industry for Q/C received as of 06 May 2011, Q27 Will IDIQ contract holders have the opportunity to make site visits prior to RTEP release, especially for efforts requiring construction?  The Gov response was A27. "Depending on the requirements for individual DO/TOs issued under the GTACS contract, the Offeror will have the ability to make site visits".  Does this mean construction will be part of the contract; therefore all references will not be removed from the PWS, as previously stated?<br><br>R80: Each delivery order will specify the requirements at the time of award.  There will be no Military construction under this contract however there may be a requirement to provide temporary facilities to support specific requirements. <br><br>Q81:  Comment: The Small Business Participation Plan requirement does not appear to be related to a multiple award contract with DO\TOs to follow but more akin to single award contracts and DO\TOs.<br>Recommendation: Consider reviewing as an example Sections L (Small Business Utilization) and M (Small Business Utilization Factor Evaluation Approach) related to of the DRFP for the Communications and Transmission Systems (CTS) solicitation.  Solicitation number W52P1J-11-R-0018. DRFP Can be found at http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aaisdus/Sow.aspx.<br>Section L&M for CTS is a good example for a Small Business Participation Plan for a multiple award contract.<br><br>R81: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q82:  There is no Management Volume.  Management risk is critical on this type of program. Suggest Government give offerors a 20 page volume to address organization structure, cost control, subcontractor management, hardware/software vendor management, EVM, reporting, Program Manager and key leads, production/manufacturing management processes, facilities, and ISO/CMMI status.  <br><br>R82: The Management information is contained in the Technical Volume.  <br><br>Q83: REF Page 3, Draft L.2.b May offerors provide a list of acronym definitions for each volume that is excluded from the page count limitations?<br><br>R83: Yes <br><br>Q84:  REF Page 3, Draft L.2.c Is there a page limit and any instructions for the "Summary Section" requested in each file per L.2.c? <br><br>R84:  Yes, Please refer to R21.  <br><br>Q85:  REF Page 4, Draft L.2.c (i) What is the page limit for the Technical Volume I Executive Summary?

Does this mean the total proposed price for the 3 Sample Tasks, OR for subcontractors that the prime envisions to have a minimum 20% participation across the life of the GTACS contract 5 year life?  The latter is recommended since key past performance should be tied to subcontractors' roles for total support; the Sample Tasks are not necessarily indicative of the prime contractor's overall team structure and subcontracting plan.  <br><br>R87: Please refer to R47. <br><br>Q88: REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c(ii)(e) Paragraph (e) requests that offerors fill out part I of the PRAG questionnaire, give it to their reference points of contact, and have the points of contact return surveys back to the offeror for submission with the proposal. The PRAG form contradicts this instruction and requests that points of contact e-mail the survey directly to the GTACS contracting officer. Please clarify. Note - we recommend that points of contact e-mail surveys directly to the GTACS contracting officer.<br><br>R88: Please refer to R37<br><br>Q89:  REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c(ii)(e) PRAG Questionnaire If, as requested in paragraph (e), offerors will indeed be required to submit completed PRAG surveys with their proposals, we request that they be excluded from the page count. The PRAG form is 3 pages in length, and the Government has requested that the Contracting Activity and the Technical Representative for each referenced effort fill out a questionnaire. This will take up other valuable pages that will be important for the Government's evaluation. Please remove the questionnaires from page count considerations (if they are to be submitted with proposals).<br><br>R89: Please refer to R22<br><br>Q90:  REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c (iv) Is VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN, to be listed as (iii)?<br><br>R90: Yes<br><br>Q91:  REF Page 7, Draft L.2.c(iv)(b) Subcontracting Goals (Para b, page 7) - is this profile based on the TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE?  If so, the Government needs to provide an estimated value for the total contract value.  If the total value is based on the 3 Sample Tasks, the total program subcontracting goals will be impossible to realistically calculate and portray (also reference Draft Section M, page 19, Para 4(f).<br><br>R91: The answer to this question will be posted at a later date. <br><br>Q92: REF Page 11, L.2.c(iv)(3)(a) Paragraph (3)(a) requires the Small Business Participation Plan to have  "Base your percentages on TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE."  Are we to use the grand total of the 3 Sample Tasks as TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE; or use the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) after the multipliers are applied as indicated on page 18 - Draft Section M.C.3.b.<br><br>R92: Total evaluated price<br><br>Q93:  REF Page 11, Draft L.2.c(iii) Page 11 states "The Offeror shall provide Cost, Cost Plus, and Firm-Fixed Prices for its proposed notional systems/equipment in response to the three Sample Tasks provided with the RFP".  Please advise if it is correct to assume only one of the procurement types indicated will be required for each task; and if the Government will specify the type of pricing desired for each separate task order?  <br><br>R93:  Only one contract type will be utilized per sample task.<br><br>Q94: REF Page 13, Draft L.2.c (iii)(a)iv VOLUME IV - COST PRICE - Section (iii)(a)iv: Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort:  Are we to include the interdivisional efforts as subcontracted dollars?]<br>	<br>R94: Yes, however, each prime shall propose IAW the Prime's disclosed practices.<br><br>Q95:  REF Page 16, Draft M.A  Paragraph M.A - Basis for Award, states, "Each RTEP will be competed amongst all Prime Contractors to the maximum extent practicable, and in accordance with the agreed upon Small Business Partial set-aside value of $3 Million threshold See section 4 below for additional detail." Section 4 provides no additional details of the $3 Million threshold. Please provide additional details.<br><br>R95: Section 4 reference will not be included in the final RFP.<br><br>Q96:  Para 3.14.12 - Small business - "All delivery/task orders below the $1 Million threshold that do not require development/ production/maintenance by an original equipment manufacturer or are otherwise restricted by proprietary requirements will be initially set-aside for small business awardees.  If after a three (3) day period two or more Small Business awardees indicate that they will not or cannot fulfill the requirement, it will then be solicited to all contract awardees regardless of size."  <br><br>Please clarify the Government's intent.  Are set-aside task orders only for efforts less than or equal to $1M, regardless of scope, i.e. the scope could address any aspect of the GTACS PWS?  Are all task orders valued over $1M, regardless of previous OEM involvement, to be solicited among all contract awardees?  <br><br>R96:  The partial set aside is $3M and could address any aspect of the GTACS PWS. Anything above that will be competed on a full and open competition.<br><br>Q97:  Does the Government intend to release a draft version of the full RFP, particularly Section L, Instructions and Section M, Evaluation Criteria?<br><br>R97:  See response to Q72<br><br>Q98: In accordance with the statement included in the posting of April 21, 2011 please clarify if the Government is requesting and accepting early submission of proposals and information at this time; and in advance of the issuance of the final solicitation and task orders.  <br><br>The statement included in this posting "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted." implies the opportunity is available for the industry to submit proposals, capability statements, and information under this requirement which may be included and evaluated at the time of the final solicitation.  <br><br>Please advise if additional information is desired and requested at this time.<br><br>R98: No additional information is required<br><br>Q99:  In cases where a subcontractor on a GTACS Team is based out of Canada and has a subsidiary created for the purposes of conducting business with the U.S.  Government, where the subcontractor's rates and cost build-up formulas are typically audited by the Canadian Commercial Corp. (CCC) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), will the requirement for submission of that subcontractor's proprietary cost information "sealed data" through an Army web site be waived, and normal CCC submission of the proprietary data be acceptable.  <br><br>R99: No, the requirements for submission, under DOD policy and United States Law, by a foreign subsidiary will not be waived. <br><br>Q100:  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), will the Government provide that contractor a fair opportunity to bid the low rate/full rate production work should a requirement exist for that production work?    It is recommended that the development of final drawings, specifications, and models that would form the basis of another GTACS task order which is production and sustainment of the approved final configuration/design be performed by PEO C3T's SETA contractor, which would avoid an OCI for the original EDM developer, which is in the best interest of the Army, since GTACS teams are being formulated to address the total set of PWS requirements, and that production of that EDM / prototype would be a natural continuation of life cycle support for the procurement of those system (s).  Does the Government envision that this process could be streamlined by including all facets of the life cycle support in a single task order, particularly for ACAT programs?<br><br>R100: Yes <br><br>Q101:  Please advise if the Government is planning to provide responses to all the questions submitted to date under this effort.<br><br>R101: Yes<br><br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information.  <br><br>Contracting Office: <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND<br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                  Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist               Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief    Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>Response to Industry Questions for 06 July 2011 Draft Section L&M SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following are questions and responses 51 through 103 to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of 13 July 2011, 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q51.  Reference:  Page 8, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section L Para iii 1 (e) List principal supplies/services to be subcontracted to. (e) Prior Performance Information:<br>Question:  "(e)" appears twice.  The first instance of (e) asks for a list of principal supplies/services. The second instance asks for "Prior Performance Information. Would the Government clarify whether both (e) paragraphs should be included?<br>R51.  This has been corrected<br><br>Q52.  Reference:  Page 10, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section L (iv) VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR), iii. ODCs/Travel; -a priced summary of ODCs/Travel that includes a level of detail necessary for the Government to evaluate its components. <br> Question:  Is the price summary the bidder submits related to ODCs/Travel to be based on the Sample Task Orders or will the Government provide an estimated value for ODCs and travel?<br>R52. The price summary is based on the sample tasks.<br><br>Q53.  Reference:  Page 10 & 12, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section L (iv) Volume IV-Cost-Price (Factors) Subsection iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort; Page 10 states "The prime contractor must provide  the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all S/IE costs $700K and over. However, subsection vii. Fee/Profit (d) (page 12) states that "The prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all sub/interdivisional costs $700K and over to include the selection and activities of your subcontractor(s)."  <br>Question:  Would the government clarify if the Prime contractor must provide or must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the FAR threshold of $700K?<br>R53.  The prime contractor must provide the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all S/IE costs $700K and over.<br><br>Q54.  Reference:  Page 11, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section L (iv) VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR); vii. Fee/Profit Provide the mathematical calculation of the proposed fixed fee/profit.  (b) Cost/Price Proposal (PRICING METHODOLOGY)  (c) Cost/Price Proposal (Sanitized Cost/Price Submission). The Offeror shall submit a sanitized version of the excel files detailed in paragraphs a, and b and C.<br>Question:  Section vii. Fee/Profit does not have a paragraph "(a)" although it appears paragraph "(c)" references it. Is "(a)" missing from the Draft L&M?<br>R54.  This correction has been made.<br><br>Q55.  Reference:  Page 17 and 18, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section M Para 4 b; On page 17,the  last paragraph before Table 1 CLIN List states "CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract ... "  On page 18, Table 1 CLIN List, lines 3 and 4 state "CLIN 0001 (Fixed Price CLIN ) and "0002 (Cost Reimbursement CLIN)" are "For use on future Delivery/Task Orders."<br>Question:  Would the Government state which of two references to CLINs 0001 and 0002 the Offeror should use? Currently, definitions contradict each other.<br>R55. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q56.  Reference:  Page16, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section M Section 3 para. G; Note:  Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements.<br>Question:  What is the definition of the term "aggressive?" How will the term be measured?  What is the weight given to "additional credit?"<br>R56. This reference has been removed.<br><br>Q57.  Reference:  Section L Page 10 references Enclosure 05.<br>Question:  When will the government be providing the referenced enclosure? <br>R57. All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted<br><br>Q58.  Does the government anticipate requiring offers to submit labor rates for all labor categories at the IDIQ level? <br>R58. It is not necessary to submit labor rated for all labor categories.  However all Offeror labor categories must be mapped into the provided Government labor categories in accordance with Section L, Volume IV - Cost-Price factor.  <br><br>Q59.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c, Page 3 AND Section L, Section 2.c.(i) "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion. The Executive Summary Section shall contain a brief abstract of the file." AND "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3. " Sample Task 1 allows an additional 5 pages in the response and typically an Executive Summary provides an overview of the Offeror's complete submission. Question:  Does the Government desire an Executive Summary (overview of the entire submission) in Volume 1 and an abstract (overview of the solution presented in the volume) in each Volume?" <br>R59. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q60.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(i), Page 4 "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3. "<br>Question:  Can the Government clarify what is meant by "above an executive summary?"<br>R60. A comma has been added between the word "above" and "an".<br><br>Q61.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c, Page 3 "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion. The Executive Summary Section shall contain a brief abstract of the file." Typically an Executive Summary provides a high level overview of the Offeror's complete solution. <br>Question:  Can the Government please clarify the submission files that shall include an Executive Summary?<br>R61. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q62.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.(c).(iv), Page 9 The government makes reference to various workbooks and worksheets in Excel format within the section, linking and/or tying to other worksheets and workbooks. <br>Question:  Is the government providing these workbooks and worksheets fully formatted for the information that is being requested? Will the bidder be required to develop and create Excel files that meet all the requirements that the government has stated? Recommendation: A government provided base spreadsheet will provide a uniform format to simplify evaluation and provide a consistent basis of evaluation across Offeror submissions. <br>R62. The Government will provide the worksheet with the final RFP <br><br>Q63. Reference:  Section L, Section 2.(c).(iv).(i) Direct Labor, Page 10 "The Labor rates shall be included on the "Rate" worksheet, the labor hours proposed per Government provided labor category shall correspond to the labor hours as detailed on the BOE worksheets" <br>Question:  Is the Government requiring the Basis of Estimates to be developed using the Governments' Labor Categories. Will the BOE format be provided by the government, or will each Offeror be allowed to submit their own format?<br>R63. The Government will provide a sample BOE template, but Offerors are permitted to utilize their own format as long as all of the required information is provided. Offerors will be required to map their labor category descriptions to the Government labor category description. <br><br>Q64.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.(c).(iv).(ii) Direct Material, Page 10 "The BOE worksheets shall reference all materials listed in the Materials summary worksheet applicable to the lowest WBS level" <br>Question:  Does the government require that the total estimated material be listed in detail in the Basis of Estimate (BOE), and the WBS Worksheets? Would the government consider having the material detail located in one place in the workbooks being provided and have the other required schedules tie out to it by summary in other required worksheets? <br>R64. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q65.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP." <br>Question:  Is it the Government's intention to limit past performance submissions by requiring relevancy to the Sample Tasks instead of relevancy to the broad PWS requirements? <br>R65.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q66. Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "Sections 1 & 2 of this file shall contain the Offeror's description of all Government and commercial contracts (prime contracts and subcontracts awarded or ongoing within three years prior to the date of issuance of this solicitation) that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation." Many IDIQ contracts allow up to five (5) years for relevant past performance contracts. <br>Question:  Would the Government consider extending the 'three (3) years' to 'five (5) years' for relevant past performance under this solicitation? <br>R66. No<br><br>Q67.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "The Offeror shall include the same contract information for each major subcontractor proposed (a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" The Government is requiring prime bidders to submit past performance information for major subcontractors and has included major equipment suppliers in this category if the supplier's contribution is 20% of the total price of either a Sample Task Price or the Total Proposed Price. Vendors of hardware and software are not typically under a teaming agreement because these manufacturers want as many prime bidders using their solutions as possible. Several of the C4 industry major equipment manufacturers (vendors) are also bidding prime. Since these vendors will also be competing for a prime position on GTACS, they will have a conflict of interest in sharing past performance and pricing information with other primes with whom they are competing. Question:  How will the Government handle this potential conflict of interest for prime bidders who are also potential major equipment suppliers (vendors) under the Government's definition of 'major subcontractor'? Recommendation: Remove 'vendor (both hardware & software)' from the Government's definition of 'major subcontractor.' <br>R67.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q68.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "The Offeror shall include the same contract information for each major subcontractor proposed (a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" The Government is requiring prime bidders to submit past performance information for major subcontractors and has included vendor relationships in this category if the vendor's contribution is 20% of the total price of either a Sample Task or the Total Proposed Price. <br>Question:  If a vendor is unwilling to provide past performance information due to a potential conflict of interest, what is the consequence to the prime bidder? <br>R68. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q69.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iii) 1.e and 1.f, Page 8<br>Comment:  Under this section reference, (e) and (f) are repeated. <br>R69. Corrected<br><br>Q70.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iii) 1.f (second (f) at the bottom of Page 8) "(f) Extent of Commitment: Provide documentation regarding enforceable commitments to utilize any Small Business category, as defined by FAR 19, as subcontractors. Enforceable commitments for this effort including teaming agreements. Copies of such agreements should be provided as part of your small business participation plan." <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the sentence fragment "Enforceable commitments for this effort including teaming agreements." <br>R70. This sentence has been deleted. <br><br>Q71.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv), Page 9 "For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed." The Government describes multiple tiers of spreadsheets rolling up into other spreadsheets and it is very difficult to evaluate the need for questions without looking at what is being described. <br>Question:  Does the Government intend to release the following documents prior to final RFP release? ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2_Cost Detail.xls, ST3_Cost Detail.xls, ST_Cost Detail.xls <br>R71. All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted<br><br>Q72.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iii) 1.d, Page 7 "Additionally an Offeror who qualifies as a small business should include its prime contractor dollars in calculating its proposed percentage goals in all of the small business categories that it qualifies for example, an Offeror contractor who is a small woman owned business gets credit in the prime category, the small category, and the women owned small business category. " <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the meaning of this paragraph with regard to the statement 'prime category?' <br>R72. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q73.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv), Page 9 "For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed." <br>Question:  Does the Government intend to include a WBS in the pricing spreadsheets with the final RFP release that contains the WBS level of detail at which the Cost Plus Fixed Fee sample task pricing will be evaluated? <br>R73. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q74.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv).i & ii, Page 10/11 "-for S/IE efforts greater than $700k the subcontractor shall provide support in the same level of detail as the prime for each sample task. -each S/IE cost by contractor shall be detailed sufficiently to distinguish effort applicable by WBS and CLIN. The BOE worksheets shall detail the S/IE agencies proposed at the lowest WBS level. Detail S/IE hours applicable to Government provided labor categories as applicable." This section seems to indicate the Government is requiring 'major subcontractors', that are not 'interdivisional' to the prime, disclose the same level of pricing detail as the prime through references to Sections (iv) i and ii (direct labor and material) at the lowest WBS level. Since these subcontractors may also be competing for a prime position on GTACS, they will have a conflict of interest in sharing past performance and pricing information with other primes with whom they are competing. <br>Question:  What is the consequence to the prime if the major subcontractor (vendor) refuses to provide its proprietary information to the prime for inclusion in the WBS pricing buildup worksheet? <br>R74. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q75.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv), Pages 9 and 11 There is no section 'a' on Page 9 but there is a section 'b' on Page 11. <br>Question: Is this a typographical error?<br>R75. Yes - Corrected.<br><br>Q76.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv).(c), Page 11/12 "The Offeror shall submit a sanitized version of the excel files detailed in paragraphs a, and b and C. NO PRICE DATA (RATES/SUMMARY DOLLARS) shall be included in the SANITIZED Files." <br>Question:  What is the Government's instruction for the naming of the sanitized version of the file? <br>R76. SANITIZED_COST<br><br>Q77.  Reference:  Section M, Section 4.a, Page 17 "As a result of the Cost Realism analysis, the proposed cost for the Cost Reimbursement Sample Task may be adjusted only for purposes of determining the probable cost. " In the prior version of the Draft RFP, Section M regarding the Price/Cost evaluation approach, the approach stated that it would only adjust proposed CLIN prices upward for the purposes of evaluation. The current Draft RFP Section M, Price/Cost Evaluation Approach noted above omits this statement and states it will adjust for purposes of Probable cost. <br>Question:  Is the Government planning to adjust the proposals both up and down? <br>R77. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q78.  Reference:  Section M, Section A, Page 12 "To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for the Technical Factor and all Technical Subfactor Sample Tasks, and the SBPP factor." <br>Question:  Given the small business past performance must achieve an 'acceptable' rating to be eligible for award, can the Government clarify what is required to achieve an 'acceptable' rating? <br>R78. The Government will be utilizing the DOD guidelines (4 March 2011) for source selection as a guide for all ratings and evaluation factors will be specified in Section M of the RFP. <br><br>Q79.  Reference:  Section M, Section 4.a, Page 17 "CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract whereas CLINs (ST0001- ST0003) are notional only and will be used for source selection evaluation purposes only and will not become part of the contract" <br>Question:  What is the basis of award and what is to be awarded under CLIN's 0001-0002? <br>R79. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q80.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(i), page 4 AND Section M, Section C.1.b, page 14 "...Prices shall not appear in Volume I. Prices for the Sample Task TEPs shall only be provided in response to the Price/Cost Proposal submission requirements." AND "The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the proposed approach is workable and to which the proposed end results are achievable. The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach in meeting the requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful performance and completion. The evaluation shall consider realism of the proposed hours, material and labor mix. The evaluation will also assess the performance risk associated with the difference between the proposed price and the probable price developed as a result of the Cost Realism analysis of the Fixed Price Sample Tasks." These statements seem to conflict. Instructions are clear that 'prices shall not appear in Volume I,' yet the Technical Evaluation Criteria includes a reference to pricing. Question:  Will the Government please clarify the seemingly contradictory statements referenced above? <br>R80. The statements above are not contradictory.  Offerors are to provide a Cost Proposal IAW Section L (iv) VOLUME IV - PRICE-COST (FACTOR). This cost proposal will contain prices. In addition, in order to determine realism, Offerors are to provide a sanitized version (a copy of the cost proposal with the dollar amounts removed) of any materials requested in the technical volume so that realism of approach can be determined.  <br><br>Q81.  Reference:  Section M, Section A, Page 12/13 In the draft Section L&M dated June 24, the government removed the following statement that was included in the draft dated March 24: "With regards to Past Performance a risk rating of: Low Risk, Moderate Risk or Unknown Risk can be considered "Acceptable" while a rating of "High Risk" is considered "Unacceptable" and not eligible for award." <br>Question:  Was this section explaining the past performance evaluation rationale intentionally removed in the June 24 draft? <br>R81. This was removed intentionally. The Government will be utilizing the DOD guidelines for source selection as a guide for all ratings.<br><br>Q82.  Reference:  Section M, Section A, Page 12/13 In the draft Section L&M dated June 24, the government removed the following statement that was included in the draft dated March 24: "With regards to Past Performance a risk rating of: Low Risk, Moderate Risk or Unknown Risk can be considered "Acceptable" while a rating of "High Risk" is considered "Unacceptable" and not eligible for award." <br>Question:  Will an unacceptable risk rating for Past Performance make the bidder ineligible for an award? <br>R82.Yes<br><br>Q83.  Reference:  Section M, Section A, Page 12/13 In the draft Section L&M dated June 24, the government removed the following statement that was included in the draft dated March 24: "With regards to Past Performance a risk rating of: Low Risk, Moderate Risk or Unknown Risk can be considered "Acceptable" while a rating of "High Risk" is considered "Unacceptable" and not eligible for award." <br>Question:  What are the evaluation criteria relative to Past Performance? <br>R83. The Government will be utilizing the DOD guidelines (4 March 2011) for source selection as a guide for all ratings. <br><br>Q84.  Reference:  Section M, Section C.3.g, Page 16 (last paragraph) "Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements." <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the threshold above which 'additional credit' will be given? <br>R84. This reference has been removed<br><br>Q85.  Reference:  Section M, Section C.3.g, Page 16 (last paragraph) "Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements." <br>Question:  Given that the Small Business Past Performance is either acceptable or unacceptable in the evaluation criteria, can the Government clarify how 'additional credit' is computed (given) and incorporated into the evaluation process for the Small Business Past Performance? <br>R85. This reference has been removed<br><br>Q86.  Reference:  Section M, Section C.3.g, Page 16 (last paragraph) "Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements." <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the tiers and structure of the 'additional credit' above the threshold? <br>R86. The above reference has been removed. <br><br>Q87.  Reference:  March 24, 2011 Section M, Section C.1.a Adequacy of Response, Page 17 "The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the sample task. The proposals will be evaluated to determine the Offerors understanding of applicable government processes and compliance requirements necessary to achieve success. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the sample tasks have been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the following criteria: (1) proposal submission instruction section of the solicitation, (2) Adequacy of the Offeror and its subcontractor's with regard to facilities, equipment, processes and personnel to perform the sample tasks will be assessed, (3) The Offeror's capability to design, develop, produce, deploy, sustain and manage complex C3T programs, as set forth in the Sample Tasks which are part of this Section L requirement. (4) The Offeror's production capability, facilities, processes and equipment necessary to manufacture quality C3T systems and equipment." <br>Question:  The wording above was removed from the most recent draft of Section L&M. This section contained clearly defined criteria (specifically items 2, 3, and 4) for evaluating sample task responses. What was the rational for removing these criteria? <br>R87. The Government will be utilizing the DOD guidelines (4 March 2011) for this source selection. <br><br>Q88.  Reference:  Section M, C.1.a Understanding of the problem, Page 14 "The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it presents a clear understanding of all techniques involved in solving the problems and meeting the requirements; and the extent to which uncertainties are identified and resolutions proposed." As written, the Government will be evaluating the Offeror's understanding of the techniques involved in solving the problems rather than evaluating the Offeror's understanding of the problems. <br>Question:  Can the Government please clarify if they are evaluating the Offeror's understanding of the techniques or the Offeror's understanding of the problem? <br>R88. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q89.  As part of the prime's proposal, will the prime be required to submit rate schedules for itself and separate rate schedules for its subcontractors? <br>R89.  Ref to R28<br><br>Q90.  Are the Table of Contents and Executive Summary included in the page counts of Volumes I and II as defined in Table 2 of the Draft Section L & M? <br>R90. No<br><br>Q91.  Reference:  Per page 4, 1st paragraph, the current Draft Section L and M says the following: The TEP shall address the information indicated in parenthesis and italics in the applicable Sample Task. <br>Question:  Would you please clarify what is meant by information indicated in parenthesis and italics? <br>R91. This has been removed.<br><br>Q92.  Reference:  In Section L, 2 c on page 3, it states that "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion." It continues to describe on the next page the "Narrative discussion" as consisting of the information for each separate task which we know from Table 2 on page 3 to be limited to 80 pages. <br>Question:  It is then assumed that the Table of Contents and Executive Summary Section do not count in this page limit. Is our understanding correct? <br>R92. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q93.  Reference:  In Section L, 2 c on page 3, it clearly states that "All price data shall only be contained in the PRICE-COST.xls file." Yet in the response to the Small Business Participation Plan (particularly on pages 6 to 8), it requires us to enter dollar amounts for the total bid and small business participation.<br>Question:  May we omit the dollar value in each of these entries and provide the percentage of total contract value? <br>R93. No<br><br>Q94.  Reference:  Concerning Sample Task Orders (STO): Small businesses could struggle to respond to STOs that are scoped identical to the Large Business STOs. This is also true of STOs that are written and scoped as large business STOs and then reduced in quantity in a manner that still requires a disproportionate response that covers all the same work activities. <br>Comment:  It is recommended that specific, tailored SB STOs be used that are representative of the scope of contemplated SB Task Orders under the awarded IDIQ. <br>R94. Sample Task Orders have been written with the intent to request that Offerors propose a feasible approach to fulfilling a realistic requirement suitable for either small or large business offerors. <br><br>Q95.  Reference:  Price evaluation: Part 2.c.(iv) page 9 explicitly states that "Offerors prices proposed for the Sample Tasks will only be used for evaluation purposes." Some offerors will interpret this to mean that proposed sample Task Order pricing is not binding, and will propose unrealistically low STO pricing in order to be more favorably evaluated. While these unrealistic prices may result in a more favorable evaluation, this offeror could not possibly use this pricing to successfully perform the STO. The draft section L&M pricing (part 4.(b) page 17) evaluation scheme outlined to determine Cost Realism will serve to mitigate this to some degree.<br>Comment:  It is recommend that STO pricing be binding in order to ensure that the government receives reasonable and realistic pricing to evaluate. <br>R95. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q96.  Reference:  Page 17, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section <br>Question:  Please explain the purpose of the following calculations in evaluating the offeror's proposal. Are the numbers supposed to add up to the contract value of $10.2 B? The Government will calculate the 'Projected Number of DOs/TOs' for each of the three Sample Tasks as follows: ($1.5 Billion)/(Sample Task #1 average) = anticipated # of DOs/TOs under Sample Task #1 ($6.5 Billion)/(Sample Task #2 average) = anticipated # of DOs/TOs under Sample Task #2 ($1,984,902,500)/(Sample Task #3 average) = anticipated # of DOs/TOs under Sample Task #3 <br>R96. The purpose of this calculation is to evaluate the cost of an Offeror's solutions to the sample tasks over the entire lifecycle of the contract.<br><br>Q97.  Reference:  Page 3, Section L.2.C, Content Requirements.<br>Question:  Does the Executive Summary have a page count? <br>R97. The Executive Summary does not count as part of the overall page count however this is a summary section and should only include information presented in the overall proposal.  <br><br>Q98.  Reference:  Page 17, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section, Page 19, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section, last table <br>Question:  The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) formula does not seem to be the same as the last table on page 19. The description of the TEP on page 17 states that the proposed price of each Sample task will be multiplied by the anticipated # of Dos/TOs and summed to equal the Total Evaluated Price. The final table on page 19 indicates that the sum of the three Sample Tasks will be the Total Evaluated Price. Will the government please clarify which is correct? <br>R98.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q99.  Reference:  L.2.c.ii states "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP." <br>Question:  Please clarify if a greater degree of subcontract/teaming would be evaluated more favorably than a lesser degree of subcontract/teaming. In other words, would the government prefer past performance references with larger teams or smaller teams? <br>R99. The government has no preference. <br><br>Q100.  Reference:  L.2.c.ii states "(a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" <br>Question:  Please clarify if, based on the definition above, a hardware or software supplier accounting for 20% or more of a sample task would be considered either a vendor or a major subcontractor?  Please note that the industry standard is to consider such hardware/software suppliers as vendors only, whereas only companies who are integral to the delivery and performance of the task would be considered a subcontractor or a major subcontractor. <br>R100. The definition in L.2.c.ii is the definition that will be used for this contract and the offeror's response must comply with the RFP.  Additionally any vendor/subcontractor providing 20% or more of a sample task would be considered a major subcontractor.   <br><br>Q101.  Reference:  Page 3, para 2c and Page 4, para 2c(i).  <br>Question:  Are the Executive summaries for Volumes I and II included within the volume's page limit?<br>R101. The Executive Summary does not count as part of the overall page count however this is a summary section and should only include information presented in the overall proposal.<br><br>Q102.  Reference:  Page 3, para 2c and Page 4, para 2c(i).<br>Question:  Will be there a page limit for each Executive Summary?<br>R102. The Executive Summary does not count as part of the overall page count however this is a summary section and should only include information presented in the overall proposal.<br><br>Q103.  Reference:  Page 3, para 2c and Page 4, para 2c(i).<br>Question:  Will the Government provide further guidance as to their expectation of the content of each Executive Summary, e.g., an outline?<br>R103. The Executive Summary does not count as part of the overall page count.  However this is a summary section and should only include information presented in the overall proposal. <br><br>Q104.  Reference:  Pages 6 and 7, para 2c(iii).  <br>Question:  In subparagraphs b, c, d and f, are the values to be provided attributed to the total value of the three sample task orders?<br>R104. Total Contract Value" (TCV)<br><br>For the purposes of the Small Business PARTICIPATION plan - the TCV will be $10B.  References to the Small Business SUBCONTRACTING Plan normally request either the dollars or percentages intended to be subcontracted.  Each offeror will only be held to the percentages proposed, not the dollars, as an offeror may not reach the ceiling.<br><br>For how to determine Total Evaluated Price, see Section M:  'Price/Cost Evaluation Approach'. <br><br>Q105.  Reference:  Pages 6 and 7, para 2c(iii). <br>Question:  In subparagraph e, do we list the data for all of our teammates, or only those utilized in the three sample tasks?<br>R105. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q106.  Reference:  Page 9, para 2c(iv).  <br>Question:  A summary worksheet for the proposed Sample Task is provided on Attachment 04 ST Cost Detail.  Is the Attachment 04 available?  If not, will the attachment be available prior to RFP release?<br>R106.  All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted<br><br>Q107.  Reference:  Page 9, para 2c(iv) (first and second paras regarding instructions for WBS). <br>Question:  Will WBS be Government furnished?  If yes when will it be available?<br>R107. Yes once the RFP is released.<br><br>Q108.  Reference:  Page 10, para 2c(iv)i, Direct Labor.<br>Question:  When will the Government provide the labor categories and the Rate worksheet?<br>R108. A labor category spreadsheet will be provided when the RFP is released.  <br><br>Q109.  Reference:  Page10, para 2c(iv)ii, Direct Material.  <br>Question:  Will the Government furnish a BOM template with the required data fields?  When will it be available?<br>R109. This information will be provided when the final RFP is posted.<br><br>Q110.  Reference:  Page10, para 2c(iv)iii, ODC / Travel.  <br>Question:  Will the Government furnish the ODC Travel template with the required data fields? When will it be available?<br>R110.  This information will be provided when the final RFP is posted.<br><br>Q111.  Reference:  Page10, para 2c(iv)iv, Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort.<br>Question:  Will the Government reconsider the requirement to perform CAPA on Interdivisional pricing data?  Regulatory requirements are not currently present in the FAR to conduct CAPA on Interdivisional efforts nor are Interdivisional efforts characterized as subcontracts in the FAR.  The FAR requires prime contractors to perform cost or price analyses on subcontracts but doesn't extend these regulatory requirements to interdivisional efforts.<br>R111.

<DESC>Response to Industry Questions for 06 July 2011 Draft Section L&M SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following are questions and responses 1 through 50 to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of 13 July 2011, 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q1.  There are contracts in which a company is performing as a subcontractor to another company on a similar and relevant program as defined by the GTACS Draft PWS, and these two companies are also known direct competitors for the GTACS opportunity.  This is a possible Organizational Conflict of Interest (FAR part 9.5) to directly solicit a Past Performance Survey from these companies, as these GTACS competitors may have "impaired objectivity" in their responses.  Therefore, please confirm that a Past Performance Survey is not required for a company which is a subcontractor to a known and direct GTACS competitor, due to an OCI concern.  If these subject Past Performance Surveys are required in this situation, please advise if these requests can be submitted directly to the government customer (not competitor), due to the aforementioned rationale.<br>R1.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q2.  As it appears that 60% or more of the contract value will be met through the purchase of material goods (hardware), will the RFP allow for fee to be applied on all material purchases?<br>R2. Fixed price contracts are described in FAR 16.201 and there is no separation of cost elements in such contracts.   FAR Part 16.3 describes in detail the various types of Cost Reimbursement contracts and how fee is approached in such contracts.  <br><br>Q3.  Reference:  Page 3 - The table has been renamed to Table 2<br>Question:  Is there a Table 1 or is this an error?<br>R3. This should be Table 1<br><br>Q4.  Reference:  Page 3 - L2(c) "Each file of the proposal shall consist of Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section and the Narrative discussion."  <br>Question:  Is there a page limit for the required Executive Summary per volume? If so please advise page limit of executive summary per volume.<br>R4.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q5.  Reference:  Page 3 - Regarding the Executive Summary for Technical Volume. <br>Question:  Since the technical volume will likely be evaluated by three separate teams for each sample task, will the government distribute the Executive Summary for this volume to each of the same task evaluation teams?<br>R5. Yes<br><br>Q6.  Reference:  Page 4 - L 2 (i) - first sentence refers to Table 1 <br>Question:  Should this be Table 2 on page 3?<br>R6. Yes, Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP<br><br>Q7.  Reference:  Page 6 - Section 3 Subcontracts <br>Question:  Should this section be "Subcontractors"?<br>R7. Subcontracts<br><br>Q8.  Reference:  Page 6 - Section 3 <br>Question:  Does the Government want the information of all proposed subcontractors or only the major subcontractors?<br>R8. Major subcontractors only<br><br>Q9.  Reference:  Page 9 <br>Question:  Will Instructions for WBS Cost Elements worksheets be released prior to the final RFP?<br>R9. No<br><br>Q10.  Reference:  Page 9 - "Instructions for Cost Elements are identified in following subparagraphs of this section and an example of the submission workbook is provided at Attachment04, ST Cost Detail.xls." <br>Question:  Will Attachment 4 be released prior to the final RFP?<br>R10.  Attachment 4 will not be released prior to RFP.<br><br>Q11.  Reference:  Page 10 - (i) <br>Question:   Will Enclosure 5 be released prior to the final RFP? <br>R11. All enclosures will not be released prior to the RFP <br><br>Q12.  Reference:  Page 12 - section (e) <br>Question:  Should this be section (g)?<br>R12. The above reference cannot be found   <br><br>Q13.  Reference:  Page 12 - Section (f) <br>Question:  Should this be section (h)?<br>R13. The above reference cannot be found   <br><br>Q14.  Does the government intend to provide additional information regarding the weighting of evaluation criteria within each volume?<br>R14. The weighting is defined section M<br><br>Q15.  Reference:  Page 15 - (c) - "Adequacy of Approach: The Sample Task will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach demonstrate adequate and complete consideration of and satisfaction of the requirements specified in the solicitation. The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation."  Question:  When referring to "in the solicitation" is the Government referring to requirements in sample task, section L and PWS? <br>R15. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q16.  Reference:  On page 4, section (ii) opening paragraph, the government removed relevancy of PWS for Past Performance but left Sample Tasks in the new draft, but on page 6 of the same section, (ii)(c), "citing the applicable Government PWS paragraph number" is still requested. Question:  Could the government provide more insight into what references to the PWS are required and if a new PWS will be issued prior to the final RFP?<br>R16. The Offeror shall utilize the solicitation PWS as a reference when providing examples of relevant work their Major Subcontractors have completed.<br><br>Q17.  Reference: General<br>Question: To avoid repetition in the 3 Sample Tasks (ST), and to maximize technical content in the ST page counts, will the Government please consider a concise 10 page Management and Risk Control Plan which describes the overall team construct, management controls and tools, and unique facilities that would be applicable to all 3 ST responses?<br>R17. The Contracting Officer has taken this under consideration and has decided that the current methodology is sufficient enough in detail to ascertain an Offeror's ability to manage the Risk associated with this effort.    <br> <br>Q18. Reference: L.2.c - Content Requirements, Page 3.  "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion."<br>Question:  Please provide a summary of what is desired in the Narrative Discussion for Volume V, Solicitation, Offer and Award Documents and Certifications/Representations; and if Narrative Discussions for Volume V will be evaluated.<br>R18.  Section L 'Instructions to Offerors' of Volume V - Solicitation, Offer and Award Documents and Certifications/Representations as listed in the draft L&M which was posted provides the answer to this question.  Additional clarification can be found in FAR Part 15 and clause FAR clause 52.212-2.  <br><br>Q19. Reference:  L.2.c(ii) - Volume II  - Past Performance (FACTOR), page 4.  "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP. <br>Question:  The referenced phrase has been modified from the previous draft to require relevancy against the sample tasks in lieu of the overall contract PWS. Would the government prefer to see references for work that are specifically relevant to the sample tasks (however focused they may be) as well as references that show relevance against the contract-level PWS? Additionally, should relevant work cited be limited to the specific system types discussed in the sample tasks, or would the Government prefer to see a range of relevant system types covered across the referenced work?  Please give additional guidance in this area; it is currently unclear whether offerors should focus only on the sample tasks to show relevancy or whether we should focus on both the sample tasks and the contract-level PWS.<br>R19.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q20.  Reference:  L.2.c(iii)(b) Volume III, SBPP, page 6, para iii (b).  "Total Contract Value (including options)":  L.2.c(iii)(d), page 7, under NOTE - "All percentages should use TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE as a baseline." :  SB Subcontracting Plan, para 3(a), page 9 - "base your percentages on TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE".<br>Question:  How is "Total Contract Value" calculated?  Is the Total Contract Value simply the sum of the offeror's proposed prices for the three sample tasks?  Does Total Contract Value = Total Evaluated Price?  Please clarify.<br>R20.  "Total Contract Value" (TCV)<br><br>For the purposes of the Small Business PARTICIPATION plan - the TCV will be $10B.  <br>Offerors are required to propose a percentage of the total acquisition value dollars to be awarded to small business subcontractors or teaming partners. The dollars proposed must correlate to the dollars and percentages identified in the SB subcontracting plan. <br>For how to determine Total Evaluated Price, see Section M:  'Price/Cost Evaluation Approach'. <br><br><br>Q21.  Reference:  L.2.c(iii)(f)(2), Page 9<br>Question:  In accordance with the Draft Section L, Volume III, # (2) on Page 9; Each large Business Offeror shall provide a small business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9.  In accordance with this clause, goals are to be stated as a percentage of subcontracting dollars.  What are the specific goals to be achieved by Large Businesses on the Subcontracting Plan?<br>R21. Refer to Draft Section L & M page 16; 3, g.<br><br>Q22.  Reference:  M.A, Basis for Award, page 13.  "Offerors remaining within the competitive range..."<br>Question:  What specific criteria will be used to establish a competitive range?<br>R22. The Contracting Officer will establish the competitive range once all proposals have been received and evaluated in accordance with Section M. <br><br>Q23.  Reference:  M.A, Basis for Award, page 13.  "Offerors remaining within the competitive range..."<br>Question:  If a bidder is in the competitive range, how will the Government assess best value to make/not make an award?<br>R23. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q24.  Reference:  M.B.1, Factor 1 - Technical, page 13.  "Each subfactor will be evaluated and adjectivally rated individually."<br>Question:  What adjectival ratings will be used to distinguish proposal section evaluation from another? The RFP mentions an "acceptable" rating, but no scale or range of ratings is provided. Recommend that section M include this rating scale, along with the specific criteria that would be evaluated to determine a given rating. Also recommend that a similar rating scale and criteria be provided for the past performance and small business participation plan evaluations.<br>R24. The source selection process will be following DOD source selection guidelines (4 March 2011) of which the adjectival ratings are described.  The Government will not be releasing them separately. <br><br>Q25.  Reference:  M.C - Evaluation Approach, Page 14. "Any Offeror that is already affiliated with or is contemplating any contractual relationship with any of the above companies shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, but no later than ten (10) days after issuance of the solicitation."<br>Question:  Is the contractual relationship intended to be related specifically to this effort; or does it pertain to any other relationship the parties may have beyond this solicitation?<br>R25. This reference pertains to any and all relationships to the parties mentioned both with this solicitation and beyond it.<br><br>Q26.  Reference:  M.C.1 - Past Performance Evaluation Approach. Page 15<br>Question:  Please confirm that the Past Performance Evaluation Approach should be re-numbered with a "2."<br>R26. Correct<br><br>Q27.  Reference:  PWS Section 1.0 - Scope.  The PWS specifically states "The GTACS program and contract will provide the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support the mission of PEO C3T, its PMs, PdMs and PDs."  <br>Question:  Throughout the PWS all work and Task Areas 1, 2, and 3 focus on providing services and solutions for tactical C3 systems.  The PEO C3T systems provide the tactical communications infrastructure which enable voice, data and video communications on the battlefield not only for Army communications elements but for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems as well.   <br>Interoperability requirements need to be understood by the potential bidders to propose services and solutions that are seamlessly integrated into the overall tactical battlefield.   Will the PWS and Task Areas 1, 2 and 3 specifically define the C3 systems interoperability requirements for all external hardware, software and communications systems that PEO C3T is required to interface within CONUS and OCONUS locations?  Will the respective Interface Control Documents and Systems Architecture Information Exchange Requirements be provided for Task Areas 1 through 3 (and the respective Sample Tasks if applicable) that require solutions to be integrated into the overall PEO C3T System of Systems Enterprise?<br>R27. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q28.  As part of the prime's proposal, will the prime be required to submit rate schedules for itself and separate rate schedules for its subcontractors?<br>R28. Prime offerors will be required to submit an excel file that contains the Prime's direct and indirect rates applicable to performance of the three sample tasks. Additionally, the prime contractors will be required to provide Cost and Price Analysis (CAPA) documentation for all subcontractor and interorganizational transfers' costs proposed in the three sample tasks that exceed $700K. This CAPA documentation shall address the following (which will be included in the cost and pricing spread sheet to be released with the final RFP):<br><br>1. Was adequate price competition obtained or its absence properly justified?<br>2. Did the Prime contractor adequately assess and dispose of subcontractors' alternate proposals, if offered?<br>3. Does the Prime contractor have a sound basis for selecting and determining the responsibility of the particular subcontractor?<br>4. Has the Prime contractor performed adequate cost or price analysis or price comparisons and obtained certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data if no exception applies?<br>5. Does the Prime offeror have a DCAA approved purchasing system? <br><br><br>Q29.  Are the Table of Contents and Executive Summary included in the page counts of Volumes I and II as defined in Table 2 of the Draft Section L & M?<br>R29.  No<br><br>Q30.  Reference:  Per page 4, 1st paragraph, the current Draft Section L and M says the following: The TEP shall address the information indicated in parenthesis and italics in the applicable Sample Task. <br>Question:  Would you please clarify what is meant by information indicated in parenthesis and italics?   <br> R30. Reference will be removed.<br><br>Q31.   Reference:  section L, 2, c, pg 3<br>Question:  Request that the Government consider not requiring an Executive Summary for each of the five (5) files listed in Table 2. Recommend that the Executive Summary be included only with the first file (Volume 1, Technical).<br>R31. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q32.  Reference:  section L, iii, Volume II, pg 4<br>Question:  In accordance with Section L and M, past performance reporting is required for subcontractors who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task. Please advise how many days will industry have to provide past performance to the Government for these 20% subcontracts. If industry is allowed the full 30 day proposal response periods to submit past performance assessment questionnaires by their past performance program customers, it will allow industry an opportunity to internally compete the requirements, thus providing the best partnering solution with regard to technical, price, and small business considerations.<br>R32. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q33. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, b, pg 6<br>Question:  "Total Contract Value" is no longer equal to "Total Evaluated Price" as was originally stated in a previous Q&A. It appears that the current definition of "Total Contract Value" is the sum of bidder's prices for ST1 + ST2 + ST3 including options. Please confirm this assumption.<br>R33.  "Total Contract Value" (TCV) <br><br>For the purposes of the Small Business PARTICIPATION plan - the TCV will be $10B.  References to the Small Business SUBCONTRACTING Plan normally request either the dollars or percentages intended to be subcontracted.  Each offeror will only be held to the percentages proposed not the dollars as an offeror may not reach the ceiling."<br><br>For how to determine Total Evaluated Price, see Section M:  'Price/Cost Evaluation Approach'. <br><br><br>Q34. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, pg 7<br>Question:  Draft Section L and M state that Offerors are to provide a list of small business's within Volume III, and that small and large subcontractors performing on any one of the three sample tasks are to be referenced in the Technical Proposal. Because GTACS is a broad Contract to support all of PEO C3T Program Management Offices and Programs, it is highly possible that not all team members products and services will be utilized in the 3 evaluated sample tasks, but may be utilized on future GTACS efforts. The inclusion and discussion of all team members and subcontractors at contract award is recommended to avoid time consuming requests and modifications in future Task Order awards, and will ensure PEO C3T has broad technology-based teams to perform all work necessary as defined by the PWS. Therefore, it is suggested that the Government add a teammate matrix that is matched to the PWS, as part of the RFP and provide ample space for a complete team identification and role/capability-based response.<br>R34. The government has taken this under consideration and will not be requiring a team mate matrix.  The team should be discussed within the proposal in accordance with section L. <br><br>Q35. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, e, pg 7<br>Question:  Regarding the section starting, "(e) List principal supplies/services to be subcontracted to. Be specific as possible (i.e. references to statement of work, etc) that will demonstrate a variety and complexity of work: Please define "principal" in this context, since there may be very differing perceptions of this.<br>R35. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q36. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, e, pg 7<br>Question:  The HBCU/MI category appears in the underlined structure on the bottom of page 7, but does not appear in the structure on the top of page 7. Please advise if bidders will be required to meet any specific Government defined HBCU/MI goals. It had been understood that the HBCU reference had been removed in a previous question response.<br>R36. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q37. Reference:  section L, iv, Volume IV, p 9<br>Question:  Request the Government provide an example of the draft attachment 04, ST_Cost Detail.xls and the instructions for WBS cost element and cost elements worksheets, as soon as possible. The Pre-solicitation Draft Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire for SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-RC001 GTACS and previous responses R1, R31, R32 and R52 all indicated the Government would provide the workbook. Please advise when this important document can be provided. Early release of this document will be beneficial in reduction of industry questions and possible resulting delays.<br>R37. All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted unless otherwise notified.   <br><br>Q38. Reference:  section L, iv, Volume IV, p 9<br>Question:  Suggest that the Government consider providing the WBS and cost worksheets formats. Also, we suggest the cost worksheet format utilize the Government fiscal year versus the contractor fiscal year, for clarity and consistency across all proposal responses.<br>R38. The Government has taken this under consideration and is remaining with contractor fiscal year.<br><br>Q39. Reference:  section L, iv, Volume IV, p 9<br>Question:  Section L under Volume IV - Cost Price states, "Each WBS Cost Summary Worksheet will have for each Cost Element, a reference to a worksheet (single tab within workbook) containing the supporting calculations, formulas, and line item details necessary for the Government to evaluate the individual components of the Cost Element by WBS by Contractor Fiscal Year." It was mentioned in the previous industry responses (R1, R2, R3, R31, R32, R52) that this workbook will be government defined and provided. Please confirm that it is still the plan for this workbook to be Government defined and provided.<br>R39. Correct<br><br>Q40. Reference:  section L, iv, Volume IV, I, pg 10<br>Question:  Regarding the section starting "..each Offeror proposed labor category shall also map to a government provided labor category (see Enclosure 05)". Please advise when the Government will provide Enclosure 05 and how many labor categories are included. Early release of this document would be beneficial in reduction of industry questions and possible resulting delays.<br>R40. All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted<br><br>Q41. Reference:  section L., iv, Volume IV, pg's 10 & 12<br>Question:  The previous Responses to Draft Sections L&M Questions from Industry, dated June 15, 2011 state (R40, R43, R75 and R76) that certified cost or pricing data will not be required, but that other than cost or pricing data may be requested for the evaluation of sample tasks. In revised Draft Section L& M section (iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Efforts), it states that the prime contractor must provide the cost/price analysis for all S/IE costs over $700K. However, the later section (d, Cost/Price Proposal Supporting documents), states that the prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis and source selection data for all S/IE costs over $700K. Please advise which of these conflicting sections should be followed.  <br>R41. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q42. Reference:  section L., iv, Volume IV, pg 11<br>Question:  Section IV - Cost-Price (Factor), vii. Fee/Profit states that FPRA or FPRA can be used in lieu of indirect cost pool components. However, Section IV - Cost-Price (Factor), v. Indirect Costs requests a detailed breakdown of Indirect Costs. Please advise if the FPRA or FPRA data can also be used in lieu of the Indirect Costs detail.<br>R42. If an offeror provides a valid FPRA for a specific cost element (direct or indirect), a breakdown for that specific direct or indirect cost will not be required.     <br><br>Q43. Reference:  section M, 4, pg 18<br>Question:  It is stated in the section that CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract. Please define these CLINS. Please advise if these CLINS will be contractually incorporated at the IDIQ vehicle award or at future task order awards.<br>R43. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q44. Reference:   General<br>Question:  Please advise estimated schedule for Draft RFP and RFP. An estimated schedule would be of great benefit to Industry for planning and resource allocation purposes.<br>R44. Estimate fourth quarter FY11<br><br>Q45. Reference:   General<br>Question:  This Draft release appears to rescind or ignore some of the previously released answers to Industry questions as posted. Please advise if the current Draft Section L&M dated 6/24/2011supersedes previous answers which would now appear in conflict.<br>R45. The draft Section L&M supersedes previous versions, and is consistent with previous Government responses.<br><br>Q46. Reference:  Jun 15, 2011 Government Answers to Questions and Comments.  Q57: Please confirm that a winning prime will not be allowed to bring on additional sub-contractors following an award.  R57: The winning Prime will be allowed to bring additional Subcontractors on following the award. "The request for the replacement of a sub-contractor after contract award shall be formally made to the contracting officer in writing - along with accompanying rationale for replacement.  R56: The Government does not intend to eliminate the term "enforceable commitment, Enforceable commitment serves as a mean to ensure Small Business participation and as a deterrent from switching Small Business team members without the approval of the Contracting Officer and the Chief Associate Director of CECOM Small Business.<br>Comment:  The Government's 15 June, 2011 response addressed the addition of a subcontractor.  However, the response relates it to the "replacement" of a subcontractor. The addition of a subcontractor is not the same as the replacement of a subcontractor.  The term "replacement" alludes to dropping a subcontractor and substituting with another subcontractor.  The term "addition" refers to bringing on a new subcontractor but not switching the new subcontractor for another from the Prime's list of subcontractors.<br>Question:  Can the Government confirm that a winning prime will be allowed to bring on additional subcontractors following an award without having to remove an existing subcontractor from the Prime's team?<br>R46. The winning prime can bring on additional subcontractors on a case by case basis with the approval of the Contracting Officer.<br><br>Q47. Reference:  The previous question<br>Question:  Will the addition of a subcontractor require the approval of the Contracting Officer and the Chief Associate Director of CECOM Small Business?<br>R47.

<DESC>Response to Un-answered Industry Questions for 06 July 2011 Draft Section L&M SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following are questions and responses not previously answered to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of 13 July 2011, 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q1.  There are contracts in which a company is performing as a subcontractor to another company on a similar and relevant program as defined by the GTACS Draft PWS, and these two companies are also known direct competitors for the GTACS opportunity.  This is a possible Organizational Conflict of Interest (FAR part 9.5) to directly solicit a Past Performance Survey from these companies, as these GTACS competitors may have "impaired objectivity" in their responses.  Therefore, please confirm that a Past Performance Survey is not required for a company which is a subcontractor to a known and direct GTACS competitor, due to an OCI concern.  If these subject Past Performance Surveys are required in this situation, please advise if these requests can be submitted directly to the government customer (not competitor), due to the aforementioned rationale.<br>R1.  The Offerors Past Performance Factor Proposal shall be submitted in accordance with Section L Volume II - Past Performance (Factor).  Any negative feedback will be carefully scrutinized and in accordance with FAR 15.306 the Offeror will be given the opportunity through clarifications and or discussions (if held) to clarify adverse past performance information. <br><br>Q4.  Reference:  Page 3 - L2(c) "Each file of the proposal shall consist of Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section and the Narrative discussion."  <br>Question:  Is there a page limit for the required Executive Summary per volume? If so please advise page limit of executive summary per volume.<br>R4.  Section L1 will be updated to read:  The Offerors proposal shall consist of five volumes and a single Executive Summary (2 pages only). Section L 2 (c) will be updated to read: Each Offerors proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and each of the above volumes contained therein shall provide a Narrative discussion where appropriate<br><br>Q15.  Reference:  Page 15 - (c) - "Adequacy of Approach: The Sample Task will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach demonstrate adequate and complete consideration of and satisfaction of the requirements specified in the solicitation. The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation."  Question:  When referring to "in the solicitation" is the Government referring to requirements in sample task, section L and PWS? <br>R15. The Government is referring to Section L and related solicitation documents which include the Sample Tasks.  <br><br>Q19. Reference:  L.2.c(ii) - Volume II  - Past Performance (FACTOR), page 4.  "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP. <br>Question:  The referenced phrase has been modified from the previous draft to require relevancy against the sample tasks in lieu of the overall contract PWS. Would the government prefer to see references for work that are specifically relevant to the sample tasks (however focused they may be) as well as references that show relevance against the contract-level PWS? Additionally, should relevant work cited be limited to the specific system types discussed in the sample tasks, or would the Government prefer to see a range of relevant system types covered across the referenced work?  Please give additional guidance in this area; it is currently unclear whether offerors should focus only on the sample tasks to show relevancy or whether we should focus on both the sample tasks and the contract-level PWS.<br>R19.  The Sample Tasks only, as instructed in Section L.<br><br>Q23.  Reference:  M.A, Basis for Award, page 13.  "Offerors remaining within the competitive range..."<br>Question:  If a bidder is in the competitive range, how will the Government assess best value to make/not make an award?<br>R23. The determination will be made on the basis of Best Value Tradeoff in accordance with Section M - Evaluation Factors, A - Basis for Award. <br><br>Q27.  Reference:  PWS Section 1.0 - Scope.  The PWS specifically states "The GTACS program and contract will provide the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support the mission of PEO C3T, its PMs, PdMs and PDs."  <br>Question:  Throughout the PWS all work and Task Areas 1, 2, and 3 focus on providing services and solutions for tactical C3 systems.  The PEO C3T systems provide the tactical communications infrastructure which enable voice, data and video communications on the battlefield not only for Army communications elements but for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems as well.   <br>Interoperability requirements need to be understood by the potential bidders to propose services and solutions that are seamlessly integrated into the overall tactical battlefield.   Will the PWS and Task Areas 1, 2 and 3 specifically define the C3 systems interoperability requirements for all external hardware, software and communications systems that PEO C3T is required to interface within CONUS and OCONUS locations?  Will the respective Interface Control Documents and Systems Architecture Information Exchange Requirements be provided for Task Areas 1 through 3 (and the respective Sample Tasks if applicable) that require solutions to be integrated into the overall PEO C3T System of Systems Enterprise?<br>R27. No, the interoperability and interface control document requirements will not be specifically defined in the sample tasks.  However, there will be certain mission requirements where the Offeror is expected to understand the necessary interfaces and present a solution that meets the mission. The Sample Tasks are intended to provide the bidders a consistent equitable opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to satisfy the contract requirements. Specific DO/TO projects' RTEPs may require interoperability and as such will provide the information necessary for their award and execution.<br><br>Q31.   Reference:  section L, 2, c, pg 3<br>Question:  Request that the Government consider not requiring an Executive Summary for each of the five (5) files listed in Table 2. Recommend that the Executive Summary be included only with the first file (Volume 1, Technical).<br>R31. See Question/Response #4 above. <br><br>Q32.  Reference:  section L, iii, Volume II, pg 4<br>Question:  In accordance with Section L and M, past performance reporting is required for subcontractors who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task. Please advise how many days will industry have to provide past performance to the Government for these 20% subcontracts. If industry is allowed the full 30 day proposal response periods to submit past performance assessment questionnaires by their past performance program customers, it will allow industry an opportunity to internally compete the requirements, thus providing the best partnering solution with regard to technical, price, and small business considerations.<br>R32. The RFP will require all questionnaires to be sent directly to the government and are no longer the Offeror's responsibility<br><br>Q35. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, e, pg 7<br>Question:  Regarding the section starting, "(e) List principal supplies/services to be subcontracted to. Be specific as possible (i.e. references to statement of work, etc) that will demonstrate a variety and complexity of work: Please define "principal" in this context, since there may be very differing perceptions of this.<br>R35. "Principal": Is defined as the most significant supplies or services the Offeror plans to subcontract out.<br><br>Q36. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, e, pg 7<br>Question:  The HBCU/MI category appears in the underlined structure on the bottom of page 7, but does not appear in the structure on the top of page 7. Please advise if bidders will be required to meet any specific Government defined HBCU/MI goals. It had been understood that the HBCU reference had been removed in a previous question response.<br>R36.  There are currently no goals associated with HBCU/MI for the Small Business Participation Plan however Section L, requires the bidders to provide/list proposed goals for all small business sub-categories deemed applicable by the offeror.<br><br>Q41. Reference:  section L., iv, Volume IV, pg's 10 & 12<br>Question:  The previous Responses to Draft Sections L&M Questions from Industry, dated June 15, 2011 state (R40, R43, R75 and R76) that certified cost or pricing data will not be required, but that other than cost or pricing data may be requested for the evaluation of sample tasks. In revised Draft Section L& M section (iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Efforts), it states that the prime contractor must provide the cost/price analysis for all S/IE costs over $700K. However, the later section (d, Cost/Price Proposal Supporting documents), states that the prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis and source selection data for all S/IE costs over $700K. Please advise which of these conflicting sections should be followed.  <br>R41. The Government will revise the reference under Section L, Volume IV Price Cost (Factor), subparagraph (d) Cost/Price Proposal (Supporting Documents) to be consistent with the language referenced under Subcontracts/Interdivisional efforts.<br><br>Q43. Reference:  section M, 4, pg 18<br>Question:  It is stated in the section that CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract. Please define these CLINS. Please advise if these CLINS will be contractually incorporated at the IDIQ vehicle award or at future task order awards.<br>R43. The Fixed price (0001) and cost re-imbursement (0002) CLINs will become part of the contract for post-award efforts that are ultimately defined at the DO/TO level.. <br><br>Q55.  Reference:  Page 17 and 18, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section M Para 4 b; On page 17,the  last paragraph before Table 1 CLIN List states "CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract ... "  On page 18, Table 1 CLIN List, lines 3 and 4 state "CLIN 0001 (Fixed Price CLIN ) and "0002 (Cost Reimbursement CLIN)" are "For use on future Delivery/Task Orders."<br>Question:  Would the Government state which of two references to CLINs 0001 and 0002 the Offeror should use? Currently, definitions contradict each other.<br>R55. See Question/Response #43 above. <br><br>Q59.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c, Page 3 AND Section L, Section 2.c.(i) "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion. The Executive Summary Section shall contain a brief abstract of the file." AND "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3. " Sample Task 1 allows an additional 5 pages in the response and typically an Executive Summary provides an overview of the Offeror's complete submission. Question:  Does the Government desire an Executive Summary (overview of the entire submission) in Volume 1 and an abstract (overview of the solution presented in the volume) in each Volume?" <br>R59. See Question/Response #31 above.<br><br>Q61.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c, Page 3 "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion. The Executive Summary Section shall contain a brief abstract of the file." Typically an Executive Summary provides a high level overview of the Offeror's complete solution. <br>Question:  Can the Government please clarify the submission files that shall include an Executive Summary?<br>R61. See Question/Response #31 above..<br><br>Q64.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.(c).(iv).(ii) Direct Material, Page 10 "The BOE worksheets shall reference all materials listed in the Materials summary worksheet applicable to the lowest WBS level" <br>Question:  Does the government require that the total estimated material be listed in detail in the Basis of Estimate (BOE), and the WBS Worksheets? Would the government consider having the material detail located in one place in the workbooks being provided and have the other required schedules tie out to it by summary in other required worksheets? <br>R64. The Government will provide a sample BOE template, but Offerors are permitted to utilize their own format as long as all of the required information is provided. For evaluation purposes, the Government will require material proposed at the lowest level of WBS to facilitate Government evaluation. <br><br>Q65.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP." <br>Question:  Is it the Government's intention to limit past performance submissions by requiring relevancy to the Sample Tasks instead of relevancy to the broad PWS requirements? <br>R65.  It is not the Governments intention to limit past performance submissions; relevant past performance shall be based on the sample tasks only.<br><br>Q67.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "The Offeror shall include the same contract information for each major subcontractor proposed (a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" The Government is requiring prime bidders to submit past performance information for major subcontractors and has included major equipment suppliers in this category if the supplier's contribution is 20% of the total price of either a Sample Task Price or the Total Proposed Price. Vendors of hardware and software are not typically under a teaming agreement because these manufacturers want as many prime bidders using their solutions as possible. Several of the C4 industry major equipment manufacturers (vendors) are also bidding prime. Since these vendors will also be competing for a prime position on GTACS, they will have a conflict of interest in sharing past performance and pricing information with other primes with whom they are competing. Question:  How will the Government handle this potential conflict of interest for prime bidders who are also potential major equipment suppliers (vendors) under the Government's definition of 'major subcontractor'? Recommendation: Remove 'vendor (both hardware & software)' from the Government's definition of 'major subcontractor.' <br>R67  See Question/Response # 1 above.<br><br>Q68.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "The Offeror shall include the same contract information for each major subcontractor proposed (a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" The Government is requiring prime bidders to submit past performance information for major subcontractors and has included vendor relationships in this category if the vendor's contribution is 20% of the total price of either a Sample Task or the Total Proposed Price. <br>Question:  If a vendor is unwilling to provide past performance information due to a potential conflict of interest, what is the consequence to the prime bidder? <br> R68. Offerors will not be penalized for lack of past performance they will instead be rated a neutral.  In addition all past performance questionnaires will be sent directly to the Government and are no longer the responsibility of the Offeror. See Question/Response # 1 above.<br><br>Q72.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iii) 1.d, Page 7 "Additionally an Offeror who qualifies as a small business should include its prime contractor dollars in calculating its proposed percentage goals in all of the small business categories that it qualifies for example, an Offeror contractor who is a small woman owned business gets credit in the prime category, the small category, and the women owned small business category. " <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the meaning of this paragraph with regard to the statement 'prime category?' <br>R72. This reference to 'Prime Category' references the 'Total Small' category on page 7 of the draft RFP posted (vol. III SB Participation Plan).   When Calculating Small Business Participation percentages, if the prime company is a small business, it can include the percentage of work that it will perform in house; as a part of total small business category and any socio-economic category that is applicable as well as any work that is subcontracted to another small business..  <br><br>Q73.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv), Page 9 "For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed." <br>Question:  Does the Government intend to include a WBS in the pricing spreadsheets with the final RFP release that contains the WBS level of detail at which the Cost Plus Fixed Fee sample task pricing will be evaluated? <br>R73. A high level WBS will be provided to the Offeror. The Offeror should complete the lower levels of the WBS based on their specific business practices. <br><br>Q74.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv).i & ii, Page 10/11 "-for S/IE efforts greater than $700k the subcontractor shall provide support in the same level of detail as the prime for each sample task. -each S/IE cost by contractor shall be detailed sufficiently to distinguish effort applicable by WBS and CLIN. The BOE worksheets shall detail the S/IE agencies proposed at the lowest WBS level. Detail S/IE hours applicable to Government provided labor categories as applicable." This section seems to indicate the Government is requiring 'major subcontractors', that are not 'interdivisional' to the prime, disclose the same level of pricing detail as the prime through references to Sections (iv) i and ii (direct labor and material) at the lowest WBS level. Since these subcontractors may also be competing for a prime position on GTACS, they will have a conflict of interest in sharing past performance and pricing information with other primes with whom they are competing. <br>Question:  What is the consequence to the prime if the major subcontractor (vendor) refuses to provide its proprietary information to the prime for inclusion in the WBS pricing buildup worksheet? <br>R74.  Section L will be revised to provide instructions for subcontractors and interdivisional efforts to submit proprietary information directly to the Government. . <br><br>Q77.  Reference:  Section M, Section 4.a, Page 17 "As a result of the Cost Realism analysis, the proposed cost for the Cost Reimbursement Sample Task may be adjusted only for purposes of determining the probable cost. " In the prior version of the Draft RFP, Section M regarding the Price/Cost evaluation approach, the approach stated that it would only adjust proposed CLIN prices upward for the purposes of evaluation. The current Draft RFP Section M, Price/Cost Evaluation Approach noted above omits this statement and states it will adjust for purposes of Probable cost. <br>Question:  Is the Government planning to adjust the proposals both up and down? <br>R77. Cost Realism analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404-1 (d) will be used to derive the probable cost for each sample task.  <br><br>Q79.  Reference:  Section M, Section 4.a, Page 17 "CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract whereas CLINs (ST0001- ST0003) are notional only and will be used for source selection evaluation purposes only and will not become part of the contract" <br>Question:  What is the basis of award and what is to be awarded under CLIN's 0001-0002? <br>R79. Awards will be made in accordance with Section M - Evaluation Factors, A - Basis for Award.  Also see Question/Response # 43 and 55 above.<br><br>Q85.  Reference:  Section M, Section C.3.g, Page 16 (last paragraph) "Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements." <br>Question:  Given that the Small Business Past Performance is either acceptable or unacceptable in the evaluation criteria, can the Government clarify how 'additional credit' is computed (given) and incorporated into the evaluation process for the Small Business Past Performance? <br>R85. This reference has been removed   Additional response: In accordance with Section M 3 (b) "enforceable commitments will be weighed more heavily than non-enforceable ones" <br><br>Q92.  Reference:  In Section L, 2 c on page 3, it states that "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion." It continues to describe on the next page the "Narrative discussion" as consisting of the information for each separate task which we know from Table 2 on page 3 to be limited to 80 pages. <br>Question:  It is then assumed that the Table of Contents and Executive Summary Section do not count in this page limit. Is our understanding correct? <br>R92. Correct, the executive Summary and Table of Contents do not count as part of the overall page count.  Also see Question/Response #4 above.<br><br>Q95.  Reference:  Price evaluation: Part 2.c.(iv) page 9 explicitly states that "Offerors prices proposed for the Sample Tasks will only be used for evaluation purposes." Some offerors will interpret this to mean that proposed sample Task Order pricing is not binding, and will propose unrealistically low STO pricing in order to be more favorably evaluated. While these unrealistic prices may result in a more favorable evaluation, this offeror could not possibly use this pricing to successfully perform the STO. The draft section L&M pricing (part 4.(b) page 17) evaluation scheme outlined to determine Cost Realism will serve to mitigate this to some degree.<br>Comment:  It is recommend that STO pricing be binding in order to ensure that the government receives reasonable and realistic pricing to evaluate. <br>R95. The pricing will not be binding . <br><br>Q98.  Reference:  Page 17, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section, Page 19, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section, last table <br>Question:  The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) formula does not seem to be the same as the last table on page 19. The description of the TEP on page 17 states that the proposed price of each Sample task will be multiplied by the anticipated # of Dos/TOs and summed to equal the Total Evaluated Price. The final table on page 19 indicates that the sum of the three Sample Tasks will be the Total Evaluated Price. Will the government please clarify which is correct? <br>R98.  The table at the end of section M has been removed. <br><br><br>Q105.  Reference:  Pages 6 and 7, para 2c(iii). <br>Question:  In subparagraph e, do we list the data for all of our teammates, or only those utilized in the three sample tasks?<br>R105. The Government expects teammates listed as part of the proposal submission to include all possible teammates.  As such the Government expects the same teammates will be utilized to bid on future DO/TOs under this contract vehicle. <br><br>Q111.  Reference:  Page10, para 2c(iv)iv, Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort.<br>Question:  Will the Government reconsider the requirement to perform CAPA on Interdivisional pricing data?  Regulatory requirements are not currently present in the FAR to conduct CAPA on Interdivisional efforts nor are Interdivisional efforts characterized as subcontracts in the FAR.  The FAR requires prime contractors to perform cost or price analyses on subcontracts but doesn't extend these regulatory requirements to interdivisional efforts.<br>R111.  We are treating interdivisional efforts as subcontracts for evaluation purposes only.<br><br><br>Contracting Office: <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND<br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                              Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1.civ@mail.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist                           Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.w.jenniss.civ@mail.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief    Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.a.hansen28.civ@mail.mil<br>

The CAC serves as both a visual confirmation of a user's identity as well as a digital authentication token. Complemented with a corresponding smart card reader, the CAC enables users to access DoD computers, networks, and facilities as well as encrypt and cryptographically sign email using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). <br><br>As the DoD workforce shifts from a physical desktop-oriented work environment to a virtually-connected mobile office presence, the reliance on CAC readers to provide a means of identity authentication has become outdated and cumbersome. With computing technologies moving towards more agile and travel-friendly form factors, like smartphones and tablets, the need for an equally mobile and integrated solution to provide user authentication is paramount in order to elicit wide acceptance and adoption from the DoD community.<br>2.0	Introduction<br><br>This RFI is a means of technical discovery and information gathering from members of industry. Program Management Network and Enterprise Services (PM NES) seeks to (1) become familiar with the current state of the market with respect to hardware and software-based certificate solutions and (2) identify commercially available technologies that could lend themselves well to user-based authentication in a mobile environment and be cost-effective to deploy across millions of users throughout DoD.<br><br>3.0	Vendor Instructions<br><br>DISCLAIMER<br>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THE RFI.<br><br>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.

Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to access tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<br><br>The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541519 (size standard $25M).<br><br>Small businesses are strongly encouraged to provide responses to this RFI, in order to assist Secure Go Mobile in determining the potential levels of interest, competition and technical capability to provide the required services within the Small Business community.

However, the importance of adapting to these newly emerging technologies while also adhering to existing security policies and requirements poses major challenges moving forward. In the realm of CMDs, it is widely known that most mobile operating systems (OS) lack the basic functionality necessary to meet minimum DoD security requirements for protecting personal, military, and enterprise data. Therefore, the need to augment existing systems with additional administrative components as part of a greater architecture becomes paramount to ensuring security and functionality across a variety of mobile device platforms.<br><br>Some of the hurdles include, but are not limited to, the securing, monitoring, and management of CMDs. In addition, the provisioning and updating of these devices at an enterprise-level poses great challenges as DoD moves towards wide proliferation of devices and tablets. Overall, the obstacles faced by the DoD community can be potentially mitigated by utilizing a mobile device management (MDM) system capable of providing a central administrative framework for tracking and monitoring CMDs as well as ensuring security policy compliance among end-point devices. <br><br>2.0	Introduction<br><br>This RFI is issued as a means of technical discovery and information gathering. Program Management Network and Enterprise Services (PM NES) seeks to (1) become familiar with the current state of the MDM market, specifically to validate available MDM features and capabilities in existence today,  (2) identify those MDM companies which are exceeding the inherent supported baseline functionality of current device platforms and applying innovative approaches to providing a greater security and enterprise management model in their MDM platforms.

Can your MDM solution create acceptable use policies for using an enterprise device for personal use?<br>66.	Can your MDM solution create different policies for employee-owned devices and company-owned devices?<br><br>Service<br><br>67.	Can your MDM solution allow for multi-tiered helpdesk support?  For example, an Army civilian would get helpdesk support from the Army but it is the same application supporting all of the various helpdesks.  Additionally, the Army helpdesk profile would allow them to only view Army devices and not the other Services, but the OSD level profile would have access to all helpdesk information.<br>68.	Can your MDM solution provide centralized administration and a single management repository for all devices managed by the enterprise but provide multi-tier management/role capability (managing hierarchal groups) in accessing mobile device information and setting policies?<br>69.	What type of reporting and business intelligence (BI) tools do you offer with your MDM product? Please provide a description of what kinds of device status reports can be produced using your tools? Are they comprised of both text and statistical graphics? Are they canned reports or can they be customized by the client?<br>70.	Can your MDM solution provide helpdesk functionality troubleshooting tools, report generation, historical analysis, and problem triage?<br>71.	Can your MDM solution provide reports and trend analysis on mobile service usage to view calls made/received, data download/upload usage, SMS usage, application downloads, toll calls, overages, inactive phones, and roaming charges? <br>72.	Can your MDM solution provide device monitoring, alarms, error logs, inventory tracking, and customizable reports? <br>73.	Can your MDM solution retrieve asset-tracking information such as serial number and asset tags?<br>74.	Can your MDM solution provide users the ability to perform self-service configuration for capabilities such as device procurement, device registration, service activation, application download/configuration, locate device, lock/wipe device, and user-contact information changes? <br>75.	Can your MDM solution support over-the-air (OTA) provisioning to which OS and version type devices? <br>76.	Can your MDM solution create configuration profiles (sometimes referred to as templates) that simplify the process of provisioning based on vendor, operating system, or model type?<br>77.	Can your MDM solution provide an audit trail capability? Many enterprises must comply with government regulations (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard [PCI-DSS] and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]) and must demonstrate their compliance with these regulations. Some MDM systems provide the ability to produce a provisioning audit trail and a resultant compliance report that can assist enterprises with their regulatory compliance-reporting obligations. Please describe in detail.<br>7.0	Constraints<br>The following constraints should be identified and mitigation processes defined in industry responses.<br><br> 	Compliance with Army security policies, guidelines and architectures including Top Level Architecture (TLA), Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) reporting, monitoring, etc. <br> 	DIACAP Authority to Operate (ATO)<br> 	Certificate to Operation (CTO)<br> 	Certificate of Networthiness (CON)<br> 	Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) <br> 	IPv6 Transition Preparation <br> 	Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) Compliance <br> 	Information Assurance Strategy (AIS) - Required for CCA compliance and the others <br> 	Global Information Grid Bandwidth Expansion (GIG BE) connectivity <br> 	Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Disaster Recovery (DR)  <br> 	Army Environmental/Facilities requirements (if applicable), specifically: <br>o	Infrastructure  <br>o	Physical Security  <br>o	Survivability  <br>o	Time lines  <br>o	Required footprint/floor space<br>o	Approvals and Ownership  <br>8.0	Transition and Transformation<br>In any organization, change is always challenging.  It is the Army's intent to transition and transform the user community to the MDM as transparently, seamlessly, and expeditiously as possible.  As such, it is requested that industry address the following additional items in their response to this RFI.<br> 	A successful mitigation plan for past transitions in the commercial or Federal marketplace.<br> 	Any capabilities that exist for users to perform a "Self-Service" migration <br> 	Any issues and mitigation techniques related to migrating devices into the new Enterprise solution.<br> 	Levels of service currently being provided in the commercial or Federal marketplace and their key performance parameters <br> 	Strategies for identifying and resolving recurring and systemic problems with the MDM system<br> 	Current methodology for providing Tier 2/Tier 3 level support services<br> 	An expected "start up" period of time in calendar days, from date of award through service provision, including installation, Information Assurance (IA) accreditations and certifications. <br>How would the transition of data to a new service provider (commercial or government) at the end of the contract be performed?<br>

<DESC>The following Project Requirements have been added to this Sources Sought Announcement and should be included in the vendor's capability statement. As a result of this Amendment, the response due date has been extended to December 9, 2011 by 4:00 PM EST.<br /><br />Project requirements:
<p>An&nbsp;Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) contract is expected for this effort for up to 5 years.&nbsp;The specific scope, technical requirements, and deliverables/schedules will be described in each request for Task Order proposal issued. Unless otherwise specified, each Task Order is expected to produce, at a minimum, a technical report suitable for use by DHAP decision makers, followed by a manuscript suitable for publication in high-impact, peer-reviewed scientific journals. Findings need to be standardized as much as possible so that comparative efficacy across behavioral and biomedical prevention interventions can be reported. <br /><br />All tasks shall fall within one or more of the following categories:</p>
<p>a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic Analyses:</span>Economic evaluation including comparative cost-effectiveness analyses of single and combination HIV prevention interventions. The Contractor shall have the capabilities, expertise, and experience to evaluate and conduct economic analyses (including cost-effectiveness, cost-outcomes, and cost-utility evaluations); financial analysis; expenditure monitoring and reporting; synthesis of economic, program, and epidemiologic data for resource estimation, strategic planning, and decision-making; economic modeling; and other areas of health economics and finance, as may be needed. Contractor shall have the expertise to build and refine a wide variety of models for economic analyses including decision-analytic models, dynamic, compartmental models of infectious disease, individual simulation models and dynamic network models.</p>
<p>b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Epidemic Modeling</span>: The Contractor shall have the capacity to build, employ, refine epidemic models of HIV transmission to evaluate the economic effects of HIV transmission and disease progression among high risk populations. The Contractor shall be able to communicate the major economic components that influence disease progression. The role of the infection rate, susceptibility, and behavioral patterns should be included to describe the fiscal implication on HIV care and prevention interventions.</p>
<p>c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resource Allocation Modeling:</span> Modeling of optimal HIV prevention funding allocation among populations and programs. Contractor shall have the experience and capacity to build and assess models for optimal HIV prevention resource allocation at the national, state, and local levels. Underlying epidemic models shall be validated against empirical data obtained by the Contractor. Uncertainty around results shall be reported and analyses performed of how the results compare with those of other resource allocation models for HIV prevention in the U.S., accounting for commonalities and discrepancies across models.</p>
<p>d) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Policy Analyses and Assessments:</span> The policy-oriented cost information produced by these assessments may be used to produce the information base for reporting on mandated reports. These products may also include summaries of effects on state/local health departments, identifying the extent to which state and local infrastructure to support such public health policies has been developed and the associated costs. Different products may need to be prepared for communicating with various stakeholders and audiences.</p>
<p>e) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Assistance:</span> The Contractor shall provide technical assistance to the CDC to support designated health departments and tribal organizations in the use of models developed by this contract or otherwise specified by CDC. Training methods may include formal classroom training, interactive video, computer-assisted training, Internet-based training, individual tutoring, mentoring, and other effective methods as specified in individual Task Orders.</p>
<p>f) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost Collection:</span> Primary cost collection of HIV prevention strategies, and literature reviews and summaries of costs and cost-effectiveness analyses of HIV prevention strategies. The Contractor shall have capability to collect and conduct research on cost data and identify measures to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of interventions. The Contractor shall develop costing tools to estimate the initial resource allocations for scaled-up interventions. Costing data shall support the revision of resource allocation targets to match current population objectives.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other important considerations:</span> <br />Cost-effectiveness analyses will include evidence based methods of representing and managing uncertainty among state and local HIV prevention interventions. The Contractor shall have the capability to apply the analyses to the general U.S. population and to specific groups within the U.S. which are HIV-infected or at high risk of HIV infection.</p>

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL OF THE OH-58D CONTROL UNIT FUEL Q<br><br>1.  Contracting Agency - United States Army Contracting Command (CCAM-AL), Aviation and Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898-5280.<br><br>2.  Description of Action - The U.S. Army Contracting Command, AMCOM Contracting Center has a requirement for a new maintenance and overhaul (M and O) contract for the Control Unit Fuel Q to support fielded OH-58D aircraft through the year 2014.

Authority Cited - The authority is 10 United States Code (USC) 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br>For Department of Defense (DOD) supplies, this authority is extended to include, only one or a limited number of responsible sources.<br><br><br>5. Reasons for Authority Cited: <br><br>       a. The proposed acquisition requires use of the cited statutory authority based on the fact that a DMWR does not exist for this item.  Therefore, technical data is not available to support competitive contracts for the overhaul/modification of part number 473203-005. This item will be overhauled/repaired per the contractor's drawings, and blueprints.<br><br>b. Per Sustainment Engineering Division, AED, AMSRD-AMR-AE-K, Simmonds Precision Products, Inc. DBA Goodrich Fuel and Utilities Systems (CAGE 89305) is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only approved source for overhaul of this item.  Simmonds Precision, Inc.  is the only source that possesses the technical data required to overhaul this item.  <br><br>c. The required delivery for this Control Unit Fuel Q is 5 per month, commencing 30 days after receipt of order.  Delay of the acquisition will degrade readiness of the fielded OH-58 aircraft fleets.  At the present time, only one source is approved for overhaul and maintenance on the Control Unit Fuel Q.  <br>			<br>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition - The proposed acquisition will be forwarded on/about 30 April 2010 for publication in the FedBizOpps pursuant to FAR 5.201 as a synopsis. The extent of effective competition anticipated is limited to the approved source. Future procurements may identify new sources, through publication in the FedBizOpps and the Competition Advocates Shopping List (CASL).<br><br>7.  Action to Increase Competition. The DMWR data is not available to support a competitive solicitation.  Simmonds Precision, Inc. is the only approved source that can successfully overhaul the Control Unit Fuel Q.  This item is listed in the June 2009 update of the CASL. The ARISE database was queried on August 26, 2009 and there are no pending Source Approval Requests (SAR's) See attached email. To date, no other sources have expressed a written interest in this acquisition. <br><br>8.  Market Research - Market Research as defined in FAR 10.001 was conducted on November 9, 2009 based on knowledge of individuals within the Government and industry, and reviewing Government and/or commercial databases (See attached Research Report/Commerciality Determination dated May 09). The item is a commercial item and FAR Part 12 will be used for this acquisition but no DMWR or technical data exist to support a competitive contract.  The item is listed in the Competition Advocate's Shopping List (June 09).  <br><br>9.  Interested Source(s) -This item will be submitted for publication in the FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.201 as stated in Paragraph 6 above. Interested sources identified through synopsis will receive due consideration as required by law. <br><br>10.  Other Factors:<br><br>a. Acquisition Data Availability, follow-on acquisition is not anticipated to be full and open competition, due to reasons cited in paragraph 5, above.<br> <br>b. Procurement history for Control Unit Fuel Q requirement - Simmonds Precision Products was the previous contractor to overhaul this item through contract W58RGZ-08-D0210/0003 and the only contractor that has overhauled the Control Unit Fuel Q in the past. (See attached price history printout). Bell Helicopter has received a prior contract for the manufacture of this item but they are not a repair source. <br><br>c. A Subcontracting Plan is required per FAR 19.702 and FAR 19.704, for large businesses on acquisitions that exceed $500K.  According to FAR 19.704, the contractor must include FAR 52.219-8, entitled Utilization of Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Business Concerns, in all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities, and shall require all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities to adopt a plan that complies with the requirements of the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small and Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business, Hub Zone Small Business Concerns Subcontracting Plan. The contractor is required to comply with FAR 52.244-5 Competition in Subcontracting. Simmonds Precision Products is a large business and will be required to comply with these requirements.<br><br>11.
