<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has a requirement for the continued development of a prototype system to support the Navy’s Theater UnderSea Warfare (TUSW) program.  TUSW is a wide-ranging effort to radically improve the capability of the theater commander to successfully conduct Undersea Warfare (USW) by improving the timeliness, accuracy, completeness, and hence the “actionability” of information collected and processed in-theater by a wide variety of USW assets.  ONR intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin Orincon Defense; 4770 Eastgate Mall; San Diego, CA for these services and requirements.  Under previous developmental efforts, Locheed Martin Orincon Defense (LMOD) developed the C41 Knowledge Management Terminal (CKMT).  This stand alone terminal encompasses a wide variety of capabilities including: modeling, tracking, and analysis of TUSW data.  Both the initial prototype CKMT and a second generation CKMT were designed, developed, demonstrated, and delivered under NAVAIR contract N00421-02-D-3603.  Additionally, further development was conducted by LMOD under ONR contract N00014-00-D-0127/0012. This effort is for the development of an Asset Allocation Tool (AAT) and a Reconstruction and Data Mining System (RDMS).  Based on the substantial development previously conducted by LMOD, LMOD is the only potential offeror with the unique capabilities to perform the work. (See Numbered Note 22).

IBIS Source Code Escrow and Verification
Statement of Work

1	INTRODUCTION
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (hereinafter referred to as "ATF" or "the Government") is a law enforcement organization and a component of the United States Government.  ATF’s responsibilities include reducing violent crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public.  ATF enforces Federal laws and regulations relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives, and arson by working directly and in cooperation with other Federal Government agencies and State and local law enforcement agencies to:
* Suppress and prevent crime and violence through enforcement, regulation and community outreach.
* Ensure fair and proper revenue collection.
* Provide fair and effective industry regulation.
* Support and assist Federal, State, Local and International Law Enforcement.
* Provide innovative training programs in support of criminal and regulatory enforcement functions.
* Help reduce the criminal use of firearms – ATF assists other State, Local and Foreign Law Enforcement agencies in reducing crime and violence.
* Provide for public safety by reducing the criminal misuse of explosives, combating arson, and remove safety hazards caused by improper and unsafe storage of explosive materials.
* Assist in suppressing commercial bribery, consumer deception, and other prohibited trade practices in alcohol beverage industry by effective enforcement of the Federal Alcohol Act.
In the area of firearms enforcement, the ATF Strategic Plan is to reduce gun violence in the United States and fairly and effectively regulate the legitimate firearms industry.  ATF's primary targets are suspects who illegally use firearms and/or supply guns to criminals or children.  One tool aiding ATF in this endeavor is the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network Program (hereinafter referred to as "the NIBIN Program").
The NIBIN Program was developed to work in concert with all of ATF's firearms enforcement initiatives.  With the NIBIN Program, ATF has successfully integrated its expertise in the regulation of the firearms industry and the effective enforcement of Federal firearms laws with technological advances in the forensic ballistics examination field.  This unique program uses all of the resources that ATF has to offer in working with our law enforcement counterparts to reduce firearms violence.
As each fingerprint is different, a firearm leaves unique, identifiable characteristics on expelled ammunition.  The NIBIN Program employs the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS) to compare images of ballistic evidence (projectiles and cartridge casings) obtained from crime scenes and recovered firearms.  
The IBIS System is comprised of hardware and software that performs the complete automated function of acquiring, correlating and comparing bullet/casing images, excluding microgroove and polygonal rifling irrespective of their composition or physical condition, and generates a data report of the results.  As new images are entered, the IBIS System searches the existing database for possible matches that must be confirmed by a firearms examiner.  As a result, the IBIS System has amassed a large ballistics image database filled with crime gun data from all over the country from which Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies may obtain law enforcement information. 
With the NIBIN Program, the ATF has created a national resource that enables participating law enforcement agencies to store shooting-related data and test-fire specimen from recovered firearms in one common system capable of performing comparisons and producing probable matches.  Through the NIBIN Program, the ATF is deploying ballistic imaging and comparison equipment to State and local law enforcement agencies.  This equipment enables the agencies to compare firearms evidence from a large number of crimes quickly, finding potential links between crimes that would not have been connected without using the IBIS System.  The NIBIN Program network also provides the capability to share data across jurisdictional lines, discovering links between crimes in different localities or different States.  Automated ballistics technology is one more weapon in the arsenal of resources that ATF maintains to assist our partners, the State and local law enforcement agencies.
The IBIS vendor, Forensic Technology, Inc. (FTI), has agreed to enter into an escrow agreement and deposit the IBIS System source code as well as any updates with the depository.
There are currently four system types that comprise the IBIS system. The predominant, and most complex, system type is the Remote Data Acquisition Station (DAS/R). This system acquires images for both cartridge casings and bullets, stores images in an Oracle database, provides image analysis capabilities, and communicates with regional (WAN) servers. The MatchPoint system provides image analysis for images acquired on local systems as well as images imported from regional servers. Rapid Brass Input (RBI) systems acquire images for cartridge casings and communicate with DAS/R systems over a telephone modem connections. IBIS servers (SVR) correlate new images against stored data to provide links between ballistics evidence.  The DAS/R, RBI, and MPO are Windows systems running Windows NT and Windows 2000. The regional servers are SGI Irix systems. The IBIS system currently uses Oracle 7 as a database.
The IBIS vendor is developing four additional system types that will become part of the NIBIN / IBIS infrastructure. These are next generation systems that provide similar functionality as those currently deployed. These are known as BulletTrax, BrassTrax, PC Farm, and MatchPoint +.  BulletTrax is an automated 3-D bullet imaging system. BrassTrax is an automated cartridge casing imaging system. PC Farm is a Linux based semi-modular server farm system. BrassTrax and BulletTrax both run on either Windows 2000 or Windows XP.

2	SCOPE
The Government and the IBIS vendor have agreed to enter into an Escrow Agreement with an independent depository acceptable to both parties. Under such Escrow Agreement, the IBIS vendor has agreed to deposit the IBIS System source code as well as any updates there to with the depository, and shall allow the Government to have access to and use the IBIS source code under given circumstances. In order to assure the viability of the source code placed in escrow the source code, the source code must be verified to be sufficient to recreate the executables necessary for complete system functionality. 
This statement of work describes the two tasks of source code verification and source code escrow.
Task 1:	The contractor shall provide source code escrow services for the IBIS System source code for the IBIS systems used by the Government in the NIBIN program. Task 1 is a fixed-price task. If requested, the contractor shall provide escrow services for multiple years.
Task 2:	The contractor shall test and verify the source code placed in escrow for the IBIS Systems used by the Government in the NIBIN program. Task 2 is a time and materials task. The IBIS vendor is expected to provide annual upgrades to the IBIS system software. Additional software patches and upgrades may be issued at any time. If requested by the Government, the contractor shall conduct source code verification, as described below, on an annual basis for IBIS system upgrades for all IBIS system variants deployed at that time within NIBIN.

Formation of initial concepts is scheduled thru 2005. The ASIP Sensor Program is a development effort centered on providing a near-term SIGINT capability on-board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Its development period will proceed thru 2007. The scope of the subject RPS Contracts scope is concerned with ground-based ISR solutions, similar to the planned upgrades. The Government intends to contract with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as the only holders of RPS Contracts under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A) and (B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements"  This notice does not constitute a request-for-proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>GENERAL CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This is a pre-solicitation notice to be issued as a request for proposal of a government requirement.  NAICS Code will be 336611 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) qualified small businesses.  The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedures.  The award will be based upon the best value to the government considering tradeoffs between price and non-price related factors.  An example of the non-price evaluation factors follow, however; potential offerors will need to refer to the solicitation (when issued) for the selection criteria/factors to be evaluated by the government since they are subject to change.  NON-PRICE EVALUATION FACTORS:  A) PRIOR RELATED EXPERIENCE - EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS IN BUILDING VESSELS OF SIMILAR TYPE AND SIZE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF 46 CFR SUBCHAPTER T, "SMALL PASSENGER VESSELS," B) PAST PERFORMANCE - DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO BUILD FULLY FUNCTIONING VESSELS OF SIMILAR SIZE AND TYPE WITH HIGH QUALITY OF WORKMANSHIP DELIVERED ON TIME AND WITHIN CONTRACT PRICE, C) CAPACITY - DEMONSTRATED CURRENT ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT THIS VESSEL WITHIN THE GIVEN SCHEDULE.  The importance and weighting of the non-price factors in relation to price has yet to be determined by the source selection authority.  The estimated range of this project is $500,000 - $1,000,000.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with the potential contractors.  This project is subject to the Walsh-Healy Public Contracts Act.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price.  Funds are available for the proposed action, however, if the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.  Responders are advised that the requirement(s) may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation, and/or final award process based on decisions related to DOI and NPS changes.  Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) government system prior to award to be eligible for a government contract - the link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete and in-place should they be selected for the award.  In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the contracting officer is ready to award the contract, the contracting officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered in the CCR database.  Refer to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, "If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  Joint Ventures are encouraged to submit a proposal, however; offerors submitting a proposal as a Joint Venture should remember that Joint Ventures must also be registered in CCR identical to the joint venture indicated in their proposal (failure to do so will make the offeror[s] ineligible for award).  All responsible HUBZone qualified small business sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency.  The anticipated posting date to the NBC and Federal Business Opportunities Website (solicitation number N9796050063) will be on or about 2 August 2005 (subject to change) and proposals will be due on or about 31 August 2005 (subject to change) Alaska Local Time.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), Outcomes Research Branch (ORB) proposes to acquire services, on a sole source basis, of Dr. Ronald Epstein, Rochester, New York  14610 to lead and collaborate with the NCI’s scientific staff on the development of a peer-reviewed publication quality white paper on patient-centered communication in cancer care which will serve as the foundation for the NCI’s future Patient-centered Communication Initiative.  Given the central role of provider-patient communication in the delivery of health care, it is important that patient-centered communication processes are facilitated during the interactions of patients and their family members with the health care delivery team.  The ORB has identified the “assessment and improvement of the delivery and impact of patient-centered communication across the cancer care continuum” as a key research priority.  Dr. Epstein, a recognized leader on the topic of patient-centered communication had recently published, in the international journal Social Science & Medicine, an in depth, critical assessment of theoretical and practical issues related to studying patient-centered communication in patient-physician consultations (“Measuring patient-centered communication in patient-physician consultations: Theoretical and practical issues: Social Science & Medicine (2005); 61: 1516-1528).  This paper by Dr. Epstein, along with an earlier review of the literature conducted by NCI scientific staff, has significantly informed the NCI’s current planning efforts for the Patient-centered Communication Initiative and led to the recognition by NCI scientific staff for the need for developing a white paper on patient-centered communication in cancer care. In order to develop a comprehensive white paper that would substantively inform the planning efforts for the NCI’s Patient-centered Communication Initiative, scientific staff in the NCI realize the need to engage with scientists from the extramural community who are internationally recognized leaders in the field of patient-centered communication.  Specifically, the ORB/NCI seeks to collaborate with a senior communication scientist to lead the white paper project who possess the following three characteristics related to the discovery, development, and delivery aspects of patient-centered communication:  a. Discovery: The scientist would have a successful track record of publishing in reputed, peer-reviewed scientific medical journals (e.g., JAMA, Medical Care, Social Science & Medicine, etc.) on a variety of issues specific to patient-centered communication (PCC).  As part of his/her publications, the scientist would have demonstrated an in-depth understanding of the conceptualization of PCC, measurement approaches to PCC, and assessment of the impact of PCC on patient health outcomes;  b. Development: The scientist would be a clinician practicing in either a primary care or oncology setting.  Significant clinical experience (10 years or more) is essential as it would enhance his/her ability to identify and recommend, as part of the white paper, specific research studies on patient-centered communication that are grounded within the clinical context; and c. Delivery: The scientist would have extensive experience (10 years or more) in training medical professionals in communication skills that are patient-centered.  Communication skills training experience will enhance his/her ability to identify and recommend, as part of the white paper, innovative methods for disseminating best-practices on patient-centered communication throughout the care delivery system.  Dr. Epstein is the only known source to the NCI scientific staff who possesses the skills and expertise in all three areas (discovery, development, and delivery) of patient-centered communication as outlined above. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI scientific staff to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 1, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI, contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) 200050711 
for the U.S. House of Representatives
Web Site Translation Services

Due Date for Vendor Reponses August 26, 2005
Request for Information on Current Technology
This is a request for information only.  This is not a notice of Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation issuance nor is there a guarantee that either may result.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from commercial enterprises which provide human-based and/or machine-based foreign language translation services for English language Web sites.  Initially, only English to Spanish translation services will be researched.
Background and Statistics
Members of the United States House of Representatives provide a Public Web site for their constituents, the media, and the rest of the world.  Increasingly, there is interest in providing online content in languages other than English as many Representative’s Congressional Districts contain large populations of foreign language speakers.
 
In order to effectively reach this large and growing audience, translation of the textual content is necessary.  Many offices do not have bilingual staff, which necessitates hiring translation services for this task.  The Library of Congress provides translation of documents for Government agencies, but not of Web site content.

A new report from the Census Bureau states that people of Hispanic origin accounted for half of the U.S. population growth from 2003 to 2004, and now constitute one-seventh of all people in the United States.  The Bureau estimates that 41.3 million Hispanics now reside in the United States, and the trend is expected to continue due to high birth rates and immigration from Latin American countries.

Due to this rapidly growing Spanish speaking audience, many Congressional offices want to add Spanish content to their Web sites.

Respondents of interest to the House may be invited to demonstrate their system.

Specific Requirements Which Proposed Information Should Include

•	Translation services may be either human-based, machine-based, or some combination of both.
•	The capability to handle various dialects of the Spanish language must be addressed.
•	Continuous and subsequent translations need to be available to Congressional offices on an on-going basis so that Spanish Web content can stay up-to-date in parallel with English content as it is added.
•	Some offices may want whole Web sites translated, while others may want one page of content translated at a time. Therefore, a reasonable fee per unit of work should be established.
•	Translation of English to Spanish content must be provided to offices in a timely manner and with the highest accuracy possible.  In other words, a turn-around timeframe, or service level agreement, will need to be identified and specified for delivery of translated content, as well as level of accuracy. If you have established standard service levels, please include them.  
•	Content to be translated may exist in any of several formats such as: Word documents, images, text files, HTML pages, and audio/video files.  Flexibility to translate from these various sources of content will be required.
•	Outline of procedural process - Work flow for an office requesting translation services.
•	List of peripherals that may need to be purchased by either HIR or the Member offices (if any) - Hardware and/or software.
•	General plans for fee structure - For example: One time usage charges versus ongoing maintenance plans for repeat users.

PLEASE NOTE: This is an RFI ONLY!!!

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50052-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to provide literature review, interviews and site visits.  The North American Industry Classification code is 541990, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

Introduction:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to enter into a contract for a preliminary review of information available about the safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity of cancer care for the purposes of designing, implementing, and evaluating prototype delivery systems.  This contract will support literature review, site visits, case studies, and clinician group meetings.  Using a framework that outlines the objectives of cancer care, the overall focus of the project is to provide foundational information to guide the reliable translation of research evidence into practice.  A particular area of interest in this solicitation is the period of cancer care from suspicion of cancer through diagnosis and plan of care.

Background:  The mission of the National Cancer Institute is to eliminate death and suffering due to cancer.  From a health system perspective, this goal means  eliminating suffering from cancer and/or the effects of interventions and improving survival for patients whose cancer care the health system provides.  From a patient perspective, the goal can be more simply stated: “I get exactly the help I need, when I need it.”  To make such goals more specific, an appropriate starting place and statement of objectives for design of health care processes are the six aims for health care described by the Institute of Medicine.  These aims are applicable to cancer care though they must be further defined and operationalized.  Increasingly, oncologists, health services researchers, and national advisory committees have focused on the need to better understand systems of care including cancer care and at many levels including patient clinician decision making (e.g., clinical practice guidelines, evidence-based practice, accurate and complete pathology services), the flow of patients and information within and across settings of care; and the effects of external environmental factors, such as reimbursement and regulation, training.  Such understanding includes the effects of changes in these arenas on the outcomes of care that matter to patients and policymakers (e.g., clinical endpoints such as tumor shrinkage; survival, health-related quality of life, economic burden, patient experience of care).  In the field of oncology, the need for attention to care delivery, access, and costs is made more urgent because of the pipeline of new, complex, and costly technologies.  Such technologies include molecular medicine (e.g., genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, molecular imaging) and the anticipated need to tailor many possible diagnostic and therapeutic choices, in a variety of combinations for individual patients.  As in any field, new technologies in oncology bring the potential for error and patient harm as well as benefit.  The complexity of oncology care requires multidisciplinary input, the transfer of patient care across settings, departments, and specialty, and the loss of information about a patient or loss of follow-up of findings will occur unless careful attention is paid to the design of systems that minimizes these events now and in anticipation of advanced molecular and information technologies.  A major part of improving care delivery will rightly include a focus on creating safety systems such that current serious harms from, for example, a mis- or missed diagnosis, use of the wrong protocol or an error in implementing a protocol make the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes extremely unlikely not only in the short run, but also for survival and quality of life.  In addition, informatics and health information systems have the potential for making such information available to clinical settings, linking discovery, development and delivery more quickly.  Numerous studies have shown that even today, many patients throughout the United States do not receive optimal cancer care.  This requirement adopts the six Aims proposed by the Institute of Medicine.  That is, from a cancer care delivery perspective care should be:  Safe—avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them;  Effective—providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively);  Patient-centered—providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions;  Timely—reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care;  Efficient—avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy; and Equitable—providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.  Useful ideas, better data on the delivery of care, and a comprehensive approach to system change are needed to focus, motivate, and sustain substantial improvements.  Some published and much anecdotal evidence suggests considerable variation in quality, including the appropriate use of the best evidence, skill in diagnostic and treatment interventions; involving patients in decision making throughout the continuum of cancer care; and using data about practice to improve care processes.  However, it is difficult to obtain data that can be used to assess the quality and outcomes of patient care and to support the care process and quality improvement.  In addition, cancer patients often find the care system confusing and advice contradictory, identifying who is in charge of their care, and have trouble having their needs met.  The overall objective of the work is to identify barriers and facilitators of high quality cancer care; and identify innovative ideas for safer, and more effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable cancer care in the United States; including potential gains in each area from clinical information systems.  The contractor shall conduct a literature review (both peer-reviewed and “grey” literature) on the quality of cancer care; semi-structured individual and group discussions; and site visits to a selected set of cancer care service delivery organizations.  The purpose of the semi-structured discussions with key leaders and practicing clinicians and of the site visits to a variety of oncology settings is to learn from clinicians, senior leadership, health care experts, and patients about their views, gather information for improvement including innovations in care, safety-related issues, barriers to high quality care, and ideas for change, even if not already implemented.  The results of this work will inform future projects intended to design and implement systems to improve cancer care services.   The contractor shall synthesize finding of the literature review, discussions, and the site visits and present the findings and conclusions to the government for its use in designing cancer care prototypes. 

Statement of Work:

Technical Requirements:  A) The contractor shall submit a plan of work in the form of a Gantt chart with dates for each milestone and annotations for each milestone that includes personnel effort and other resources to be used; B)  Capture and summarize what is known about cancer care quality through (A) review of published and “gray literature” on cancer care quality.  Review the published peer reviewed and non peer reviewed literature in commonly used databases (e.g., PubMed, nursing, health services) and summarize the findings as a literature review with complete citations with a particular emphasis on the period of cancer care from initial suspicion through diagnosis and plan of treatment.  The contractor shall acquire and review relevant articles and relevant references in those papers and search for and gather “grey” literature (e.g., reports and position papers by commissions; papers and websites of professional, health system or health plan, and advocacy organizations) on cancer care quality.  The contractor shall summarize findings of the literature review and provide copies of the relevant references.  An electronic draft of the summary shall be made available to the government for review and comment.  C)  Interview health policy experts, senior leadership and researchers.  The contractor shall conduct at least 15 interviews by phone or in person.  Each interview shall be scheduled for approximately 60 to 90 minutes.  Interviews:  Within 60 calendar days after completion of all individual interviews, the contractor shall provide a summary to the government in draft form for review and comment.  D)  Conduct group interviews with practicing clinicians in several oncology specialties and cancer patients and/or family members of cancer patients.  The contractor shall conduct at least four group discussions, with each group organized around a specific topic or oncology specialty, for example, medical and radiation oncology, surgical oncology, oncology nursing, and/or patient/family experience.  The contractor shall develop the framework for individual and group discussion and meet with the government to finalize the specific criteria required for the framework and shall provide draft guides for review and comment by the government before any interviews take place.  Discussion topics for individual and/or group discussions shall include (but not be limited to) perceived barriers to high quality cancer care, information needs and gaps, and desired functions of a clinical cancer information system.  Both practicing oncologists and experts in health information and information technology shall be included in discussions about integrating patient and clinical data to facilitate the flow of information across settings of care and specialties.  The contractor shall include discussion about how to foster the use of health information systems for informed decision-making by patients and treating clinicians and what value this data might have for quality measurement and improvement.  The contractor shall provide to the government in draft form for review and comment a summary within 60 calendar days after completion of all individual interviews and a summary of results within 60 calendar days after each group discussion.  The contractor shall cover the costs of travel for its personnel and for participants in group discussions.    E)  Conduct site visits.  The contractor shall meet with the project officer to recommend the location and timing of site visits.  In this solicitation site visit means a geographic area.  A site visit may include multiple organizations.  The minimum requirement is the inclusion of no fewer than three and no more than six different geographic areas for site selection with the expectation that multiple organizations will be drawn from each geographic location.  Visits to each organization may vary in length from an hour to a day, and the time in a geographic location may vary in length from one to three days.  Discussion topics shall include (but not be limited to) how cancer care and interactions among specialists are organized, how care is provided, why it has been developed that way, the role of health informatics, perceived barriers to high quality cancer care, information needs and gaps, and desired functions of a clinical cancer information system.  Each site visit shall be summarized as a descriptive (not evaluative) case study.  The draft case study with relevant background appendices shall be provided to the government for review and comment.  Visits to each geographic area shall include an oncologist.  The travel and any honorarium for an oncologist shall be covered under this contract.  Additional site visit members (e.g., project officer) shall be included as required by the government, but their travel will be paid by the government. Before each site visit, the contractor shall provide to each organization to be visited  background information on the purpose of the site visit, background information on the visitors, and any applicable letters of support from e.g., government agencies, professional, advocacy, foundations.  At least seven days before each site visit, the contractor shall provide each site visitor and the government an agenda book that includes an itinerary for the visit, including names of individuals, titles, organizational addresses and contact info, background on the organizations and individuals being visited; a description of the context of each organization in the community in which it practices; information about each site visitor; a guide for site visitors that includes the topics to be discussed and expectations of their role and reporting responsibilities (e.g., debriefing).  After each site visit, the contractor shall debrief the site visitors and provide a draft case summary of each organization visited to all visitors for review within 30 calendar days of its completion.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Analytical Chemistry Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Praxair Distribution Southeast LLC of Melbourne, FL for Ultra High Purity Nitrogen Zero Gas with low Argon. 

NIST has contracted with the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to certify gas mixtures for use in monitoring of systems in the space shuttle. The UHP Nitrogen Zero Gas with low Argon being requested from Praxair is for the preparation of NIST primary standards of Argon in Nitrogen, Oxygen in Nitrogen, Helium in Nitrogen, and Hydrogen in Nitrogen.  These will in turn be used to certify mixtures for NASA.

NASA KSC uses UHP Nitrogen Zero Gas with low Argon from Praxair for their mass spectrometer-based hazardous gas detection equipment for the space shuttle.  NASA has requested that NIST use the same Nitrogen for preparing standards.  NASA’s specifications are for low Argon content at less than 5 ppm which Praxair has been able to achieve.  Additionally the nitrogen must have no more than 5 ppm total of water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons which the nitrogen from Praxair can meet. 

Sole source determination is based on the need to meet and maintain NASA’s stringent requirements for purity. In addition NIST must use the UHP Nitrogen Zero Gas with low Argon from Praxair Distribution Southeast LLC to ensure 100% compatibility.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by August 5, 2005, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Center for Education Statistics of the US Department of Education intends to acuire, on a sole source basis from SAS Institute Inc.; SAS Campus Drive, Cary, North Carolina,  27513-2414, a one year maintenance agreement for SAS®9 software.  The NCES currently uses SAS programs: Base; AF; ETF; FSP; Graph; IML; STST; Connect.

SAS®9 is a single, scalable platform providing a consistent, rewarding user experience.  It offers integrated data management and predictive analytic capabilities that tell an organization not just where it has been, but where it should go next. It delivers the foresight and understanding that is required to outperform the pack.  SAS®9 expands the definition of business intelligence, enabling enterprises to break through to a higher level of understanding, beyond the hindsight offered by traditional BI tools. SAS®9 is the only BI software that delivers these advantages:

a)  A single technology platform. The SAS Enterprise Intelligence Platform builds on an organization's existing technology investments to deliver high-quality information to every desktop or departmental server. This revolutionary platform provides a broad set of integrated software for unmatched data integration, easy-to-use business reporting and unparalleled analytics.

b)  Expanded access to analytics. SAS®9 reaches across the enterprise to deliver industry-leading SAS analytics  for understanding an organization's business past, monitoring and communicating the present, and reliably predicting the future. 

(c)  Targeted user interfaces. SAS®9 interfaces are "fit to task," designed and tailored to the varying skill levels and usage patterns of information consumers, domain experts, executives and technologists. 

The purpose of this procurement is to renew for one year the maintenance agreement.  The SAS Institute is the only vendor that provides the maintenance license for this software.

The Contracting Officer has determined that only one source is reasonably available for this effort. Sole Source authority FAR 13.106-1 is applicable.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact on or before the response due date. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in ED's assessment of capable sources.  If an acceptable response is not received by response due date, ED will initiate negotiations with the SAS Institute.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency.  For more information, contact George Harris at George.Harris@ed.gov.

The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to Penton Realty Corporation.   The extension will be for 5,884 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a term of twenty-four months.

The government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a new lease can be awarded.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government’s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  Any written comments are to be received within 30 days of the publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>On or about 01 August 2005, the US Army Engineer District, Alaska will issue a Phase I Request for Proposal for the design and construction of Replacement Family Housing at Ft. Richardson, Alaska.  This project provides for whole neighborhood revital ization by construction of up to 99 officer and enlisted family quarters.  Phase I proposals are to be received on or about 30 August 2005.  Description of Work:  This project provides for neighborhood revitalization by design and construction of approxima tely 99 officer and enlisted family quarters consisting of 1 general officer (GO) four-bedroom unit, 10 field grade officer (FGO) units (5 three-bedroom and 5 four-bedroom), 24 senior noncommissioned officer (SNCO) units (21 three-bedroom and 3 four-bedroo m), and 64 junior noncommissioned officer (JNCO) units (48 three-bedroom and 16 five-bedroom) in the Birch Hill (1 unit), Moose Haven (32 units and 2 option units), and Puffin Park (60 units and 4 option units) neighborhoods.   Five of these units will be capable of complying with the Americans Disability Act Requirements.  This project also provides for demolition and removal of 2 eightplexes in the Cottonwood Area and 11 seven and eightplexes in the Puffin Park Area. Construction consists of variously con figured single family and multi-unit, one and two story buildings which are factory built/manufactured and/or conventionally on-site constructed houses built to current standards. The design will incorporate the architectural elements and themes adopted by  the Fort Richardson Housing Community Plan. The project also will provide attached garages, individual heating controls, hard-wired interconnected smoke detectors, exterior storage, arctic space, and all equipment for functional living units. Supporting f acility construction includes electrical and communication distribution systems, water, sewer and roadways with appropriate curb and gutter and storm water management devices. Recreation facilities and sidewalks will also be constructed with residential-ty pe street lighting.  Proposal Evaluation:  This will be a two-phase design-build selection process.  The following evaluation factors are for informational purposes.  The government reserves the right to modify the evaluation factors prior to issuing the s olicitation.  Phase I solicitation period will be on or about 08/01/05 through 09/01/05 and will consist of soliciting and receiving Statements of Qualifications that includes four factors:  (A) Construction Experience: (1) Experience on similar housing pr ojects, (2) Design-Build construction experience, (3) Military construction experience, (4) Similar climate construction experience, and (5) Construction/Design teaming experience; (B) Design Experience: (1) Experience on similar housing projects, (2) Desi gn-Build experience, (3) Military design experience, (4) Similar climate design experience, and (5) LEED project experience: (C)  Past Performance of Construction Contractor and Designer:  (1) Customer satisfaction, quality and timely performance will be e valuated for each project listed under the Factors A and B above: and (D) Technical Qualifications and Approach (overall technical approach identifying  opportunities, challenges and constraints related to this solicitation, organization, responsibilities and lines of authority established to complete the design and construction of this project).  Factors (A), (B), (C) and (D) shall be approximately equal in importance.  A maximum of 3 offerors, determined most qualified based on the Phase I evaluation crit eria, will receive a detailed Request for Proposal by modification to the solicitation, Phase II, and have approximately 45 days to submit detailed technical and price proposals. Phase II solicitation period will be on or about 10/01/05 through 11/18/05 an d the evaluation criteria will consist of factors:  Technical Solution consisting of :  (A)  RFP Basic Design Requirements (narratives, drawings, color boards a nd product literature),  (B) Key Team Members (design and construction),  (C) Betterments and Contractors Proposed Betterments, and (D)  Subcontracting Plan.  Importance of these items varies: Factors (A) through (C) are from most to least important.  Fac tor (D) Subcontracting Plan will be evaluated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  The Phase II technical solution or non-price factor is more important than price.  Award will be based on the Best Value approach considering Phase II non-price evaluation fa ctors and price.  An adjectival method of evaluation will be used to evaluate the non-price factors.  If the proposal evaluated most qualified based on the Phase II non-price evaluation criteria is not the least priced proposal, a tradeoff process will be used to determine the Best Value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror, or to other than the offeror most qualified based on Phase II non-price evaluation factors.  The Phase II RFP will provi de information equivalent to the 15 percent to 30 percent level of design.

(F19628-97-D-0008).  The contracts' ordering period will be increased by three years by changing the current ending date from 31 December 03 to 31 December 06.  The contracts' period of performance will also be increased by three years by changing the current ending date from 31 December 04 to 31 December 07.  This change will not increase the ceiling price of the contract.  The extension is a contract action required to provide for the acquisition of upgrade to the existing subsystem, ground control processor (GCP) which was developed and fielded by the aforementioned contractor as part of the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). The anticipated upgrade candidate planned for functional integration into the subsystem is Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT). NCCT is a near term SIGINT capability allowing cross queuing and collaboration of disparate Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) collection assets. Its development period will proceed thru 2007.The scope of the subject RPS contract is concerned with ground-based ISR solutions, similar to the planned upgrades.  The Government intends to contract with Lockheed Martin as the only holder of RPS contract F19628-97-D-0008 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B),"Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". <br><br> Please direct any question regarding this synopsis to Tracy Sheehan, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-3998; Kathleen Delgado, Contract Negotiator, (781) 377-4063; or Lt.

Nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The information you provide will be evaluated to identify qualified potential offerors. ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Passive Millimeter Wave Imager (PMMWI) which was posted on 11 July 2005. Offerors are notified that the following changes are made:  The following SPECIFICATIONS are provided in addition to the Scope of Work (SOW) posted on the original synopsis.   The due date for responses is extended to 7 September 2005.  Note: This is a tentative date.  Offerors should check the official closing date posted on the RFP when it is issued on or about 5 August 2005 (this is also a tentative issue date for the RFP).     SPECIFICATIONS: 1.	SPECIFICATIONS: These specifications establish the performance, design, development, and test requirements for a Passive Millimeter Wavelength Imager (PMMWI) suitable for monitoring launch vehicles.  This specification identifies these requirements only for a single PMMWI which will mount to a Kennedy Space Center (KSC) provided support structure/enclosure.  This specification has a scope of a single PMMWI. If this prototype is successful, a future follow-on procurement of one, two or three PMMWIs may be ordered as an option, however there is no guarantee, regardless of prototype performance that the option will be exercised .  When multiple PMMWIs are utilized, the system will incorporate two, three or four PMMWIs.	 2.	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS The following documents form a part of this document to the extent specified herein: KSC-98203-SW-01 SOW for the Passive Millimeter Wavelength Imager (PMMWI) 3.	REQUIREMENTS 3.1	Item Definitions A Passive Millimeter Wavelength Imager (PMMWI) consists of a single imaging unit that detects passive emissions from a launch vehicle and then forms a visual image of the passively emitted radiation.  In essence, this imager is simply a camera that operates at millimeter wavelengths instead of at optical wavelengths.  Because of this difference in wavelength, however, it becomes possible to image the vehicle through the smoke and steam produced at launch.   A PMMWI system may consist of one, two, three, or four Passive Millimeter Wavelength Imagers, arrayed approximately equi-angularly around the launch complex every 90 or 120 degrees to permit real-time viewing of launch vehicles through observing the launch vehicle from independent viewing angles.   3.1.1	Item Diagrams.	None 3.1.2	Interface Definitions Three electrical and one mechanical interface are required for proper operation of the PMMWI: a) Control/status interface b) Prime power interface  c) Video output interface d) Mechanical mount interface Control/Status Interface The Control/Status Interface provides a remote means to query and control the PMMWI through an IEEE 802.3 10/100 BaseT Ethernet interface (RJ-45 connector) in order to: •Query Built-In-Test (BIT) status and mode •Command BIT Modes •Query operational status and health information  •Command RF gain setting •Query Ambient Temperature and Humidity levels Prime Power Interface The Prime Power Interface provides power for the PMMWI. US standard power, 120 VAC, 60 Hz, single phase is preferred.	Details may be negotiated upon contract award. Video Output Interface The Video Output Interface provides real-time NTSC video, derived from the scanning of the launch vehicle at millimeter wavelengths.  This image is a gray-scale television image of the launch vehicle, updated at 10 frames per second, or faster. The output shall interface with a 75-Ohm BNC connector. Mechanical Mount Interface A mechanical interface shall connect the imager to a KSC provided support structure.  The structure consists of a support structure and environmentally controlled enclosure which includes a radome window.  This PMMWI and support structure will have a fixed look-angle.  A tracking mount, in lieu of a fixed mounting bracket, may be added to the PMMWI at a later date. 3.1.3	Major Component List To be supplied by Contractor. 3.2	Characteristics 3.2.1	Performance The PMMWI shall meet the following performance requirements under any combination of the environmental conditions identified in paragraph 3.2.5. 3.2.1.1 Imaging Resolution The imaging resolution of the PMMWI shall permit the detection of an object 12-inches (0.31 meters) or greater in diameter at a fixed operating distance of 500 feet + - 75 feet (152 meters +/- 23 meters).   3.2.1.2 Frame Update Rate The video scan update rate shall be 10 frames per second, minimum, of processed black and white NTSC video. 3.2.1.3 Image Latency The processing time between collecting a complete scan and subsequently processing the scanned data to produce an NTSC video image and then providing a frame of processed scanned video on the NTSC video output shall not exceed 0.150 second.  3.2.1.4 Focus Range  500 feet (152 meters), nominal, fixed, + - 75 feet (23 meters). 3.2.1.5 Depth of Field The PMMWI shall provide a clear image of launch vehicles within the range of 425 feet to 575 feet (130 meters to 175 meters) from the PMMWI, minimum.  A clear image over a wider range of distances from the PMMWI is desirable if possible, provided that the focal length of the PMMWI is not varied in real-time. 3.2.1.6 Video Resolution The PMMWI shall provide a resolution within the processed output NTSC video of 640 x 480 pixels, or higher resolution, while meeting the imaging latency requirement of paragraph 3.2.1.3, the imaging resolution of paragraph 3.2.1.1, and the frame update rate of paragraph 3.2.1.2.  The Contractor shall provide cost for optional vertical and horizontal indicators on video output. 3.2.1.7 Exposure and AGC/Dynamic Range Automatic exposure control through the use of both fixed and Automatic Gain Control (AGC) shall be employed within the PMMWI's internal RF (Radio Frequency) processing section design.   The static RF dynamic range provided by the PMMWI internal electronics shall be 25 dB, minimum, centered on the nominal received signal levels observed for 5-second time-averaged signal levels.  This static RF dynamic range (for setting up the initial image) shall be controlled via the Control/Status interface.  The value of the gain setting shall be reported back via the Control/Status interface.  The purpose of this feature is to manually adjust the gain settings through the RF electronics prior to launch. The instantaneous RF dynamic range automatically provided by the PMMWI internal electronics shall be 120 dB minimum, + 40 dB to – 80 dB, relative to the 5-second time-averaged signal level imaged through dry air that existed just prior to pad deluge water start, and rocket motor ignition.  The PMMWI design shall be capable of providing a clear image despite an increase of up to a 40 dB in nominal signal level above that propagating through dry air prior to launch and despite up to a 80 dB decrease in nominal signal level for imaging through condensing water mist within the air.	 The reason for this dynamic range specification is based on experimental studies conducted at the Kennedy Space Center.	 3.2.1.8 Frequency of Operation The frequency of operation shall be fixed within the range of 20.100 GHz to 100 GHz.  Preferably, frequencies that limit the operational capability of the device such as the water vapor absorption frequency around 22.2 GHz and oxygen absorption frequency around 60 GHz shall not be used.  Other millimeter wave frequency bands commonly used for communication shall not be used (e.g. ISM 24 GHz, etc.).  The operational bandwidth of the PMMWI shall be kept as small as practically possible, not to exceed a bandwidth of 100 MHz, in order not to introduce sensitivity to unintended interference from narrow-band emissions from other terrestrial communication systems.  The Contractor shall verify dynamic range characteristics for propagation through steam and provide data at the Preliminary Design Review.  3.2.1.9 Horizontal Field of View Horizontal field of view shall be a minimum of 10.4 degrees.  Wider fields of view are preferable.   3.2.1.10	Vertical Field of View Vertical field of view shall be a minimum of 26 degrees.  Taller fields of view are preferable. 3.2.2	Physical Characteristics 3.2.2.1 Weight The weight of the PMMWI shall not exceed 800 lbs (363 kg). 3.2.2.2 Size The nominal size of the imaging aperture shall be 1 meter, nominal.  The size of the PMMWI shall not exceed 6 feet (H) x 4 feet (W) x 6 feet (D). (1.83m x 1.22m x 1.83m) 3.2.2.3 Heat Dissipation The heat dissipated by the PMMWI shall not exceed 1500 Watts. 3.2.3	Reliability A Mean-Time-Between-Failure of 10,000 hours, minimum, shall be provided by the PMMWI design, as computed in accordance with normal reliability engineering practices.   3.2.4	Maintainability The PMMWI shall be maintainable through regular preventative maintenance, as identified in a maintainability document prepared for the operational use of the PMMWI. The Imager shall have a design for a lifespan of 10 years. 3.2.5	Environmental Conditions 3.2.5.1 Temperature/Humidity The PPMWI will be utilized at the Kennedy Space Center, located in a sub-tropical climate, in proximity to the ocean. When feasible, the Contractor shall utilize corrosion-resistant materials in the PMMWI. The PMMWI Contractor shall identify the following in the Preliminary Design Review package: •Operating heat load •Maximum operating temperature •Minimum operating temperature •Operating humidity requirements •Maximum storage temperature •Minimum storage temperature •Storage humidity requirements 3.2.5.2 Vibration The PMMWI shall produce a clear image for 15 seconds, minimum, while the KSC support structure is exposed to 8g (rms) vertical, and 2g (rms) horizontal vibration, with a tested dwell in the vicinity of 1 kHz.	The support structure is mounted to a floor with a vertical vibration of 63 Hz to 125 Hz on the horizontal plane.  The Contractor shall identify the maximum design vibration loads for their PMMWI in the PDR package.   Contractors should consider loop bandwidths of around 8 to 10 kHz for local oscillator control systems (used, perhaps, for frequency down conversion within the Passive Millimeter Wavelength Imaging system) which are necessary to reduce in-band acoustic energy peaked around 1 kHz by multiple tens of dB to best preserve the image quality. Vibration levels could also be moderated electrically by mechanically designing for the acoustic noise environment and selecting an electrical synthesizer loop bandwidth around 8 to 10 kHz for any frequency converter stage. 3.2.5.3 Acoustic Noise The PMMWI shall be capable of producing a clear image for 15 seconds, minimum, while the KSC support structure is exposed to an acoustic vibration having a peak frequency at 1000 Hz, with an overall Sound Pressure Level of 151 dB. The KSC provided support structure will include an enclosure (radome) over the PMMWI to protect partially against acoustic buffeting in excess of 150 dB at a peak frequency of about 1 kHz.  The Contractor shall identify the maximum design acoustic noise loads for their PMMWI and shall specify any special properties for the radome window at the PDR. 3.2.5.4 Mounting and Installation The PMMWI shall be suitable for mounting on a KSC provided support structure. The Contractor shall identify lifting points, CG, mounting loads and dimensions on the Interface Control Drawing (ICD). 3.2.6	Transportability The KSC provided support structure, with the PMMWI attached, shall be designed for transport on a small trailer over normal roadways.  The Contractor shall design the PMMWI with a method of lifting by an overhead crane for unpacking and installation on the support structure.  The PMMWI shipping container shall be designed for forklift operations.  The PMMWI design shall include, where necessary, quick-acting locking or stow pins for safe transport purposes. 3.3	Design and Construction 3.3.1	Materials, Processes and Parts Materials, processes and parts shall be in conformance with best commercial practices.  All metal surfaces shall be passivated or otherwise protected against salt-fog and coastal weather conditions for location near the sea, for an expected lifetime in excess of 10 years, without excessive refurbishment and repair being required. 3.3.2	Electromagnetic Radiation The PMMWI shall emit no un-intentional radiation while imaging or when in stand-by operation.  Radiation from the imager for test calibration and sensitivity purposes shall be below 2.0 microvolt/meter over 20.1 GHz to 100 GHz.	Temporary radiation signals for test calibration purposes are permitted, upon manual command via the Control/Status interface. 3.3.3	Nameplates and Product Marking A corrosion-resistant nameplate shall be attached on a permanent visible portion of the PMMWI.	As a minimum, this nameplate shall contain the following:  •Specification number •Contract number •Serial number  •Manufacturer name and address •Date of manufacture •Voltage •Amperage •Power Frequency •Weight 3.3.4	Interchangeability The PMMWI unit shall be interchangeable in the future with similar units with a minimum of operations by the user.  The PMMWI shall support assignment of the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the Control/Status interface. 3.3.5	Safety The PMMWI shall be designed to avoid the use of elements, compounds, and chemicals known to cause health issues with humans wherever possible.  In the event that such risks are not possible to avoid, a warning nameplate shall be placed on a permanent portion of the imager alerting users to the presence of dangerous materials.  The Contractor shall identify these materials to NASA for approval at PDR. 3.3.6	Human Performance/Human Engineering The PMMWI shall be designed to maximize the ease of use of the equipment by trained technicians who are not otherwise familiar with millimeter wave equipment.  A web-based interface for interrogating the status of built-in-test and operational status shall preferably be provided for the Control/Status interface. 3.4	Logistics 3.4.1	Maintenance Maintenance locations and frequency shall be identified in the O&M manual.  Projected maintenance frequency/activity and associated cost information is to be included with the bid. 3.4.2	Supply Critical Parts List shall identify any unique supplies required for the lifetime of the unit.  The Contractor shall provide critical spares for the first year of life. 3.4.3	Facilities and Facility Equipment The Contractor shall provide all facilities and equipment necessary to fabricate and perform factory acceptance tests of the prototype unit. 3.5	Personnel and Training 3.5.1	Personnel The PMMWI shall be designed to be operated by a single person. 3.5.2	Training The Contractor shall provide formal training of individuals at KSC to install, operate and maintain the PMMWI which shall not exceed 2 weeks in duration.  NASA reserves the right to videotape the training sessions for future training use. 3.6	Major Component Characteristics The major components shall be identified in the top-level assembly drawing.  Any unique characteristics shall be identified by the Contractor. 3.7	Precedence In the event of conflict between the Statement of Work, this specification, and applicable documents called out in this specification, the order of precedence shall be the Statement of Work followed by this specification followed by the applicable documents.   4.0	Quality Assurance Provisions 4.1	General As a minimum, a formal acceptance test conducted in accordance with approved test procedures, using test equipment having calibrations traceable to NIST standards, shall be used in the sell-off of each PMMWI.

<DESC>Wind Power - Electricity Generation- Sources Sought

July 18, 2005

This notice shall remain open until October 28, 2005.

The U.S. General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Region 7, is interested in hearing from Wind Farm Developers, Financiers, Utility Companies and Electric Power Industry participants and Retail Electric Providers and Wholesale Power Providers and/or others engaged in aspects of the renewable wind power generation, delivery, and electric power supply business.  GSA seeks to lower its electric power expenses and its building operating costs while also providing environmental benefits, improving air quality, and advancing other governmental goals and objectives. 

 GSA anticipates having a requirement for a large scale renewable wind power purchase on or about June 2008, for some of its buildings in Texas.  Currently, in deregulated markets, in the State of Texas, the region purchases approximately 134 million kWhs of electric power per year for the operation of some 84 of its buildings. These buildings are located in the TXU, Reliant, CPL and WTU service areas. The Region is interested in exploring the feasibility of obtaining all or  large percentages of its Texas electric power requirements from renewable wind generated electricity, at highly competitive and cost effective prices. 

GSA Region 7 desires to have conversations and discussions with industry as to industry capabilities and industry recommended solutions to technical issues surrounding the reliable and cost effective delivery of wind generated power. Such conversations would include plans to address periods of time when the wind resource is unavailable for generation of power, or how to make use of wind generation that does not coincide with “time of use” power demand at GSA buildings.  Information is sought as to cost of installation,  costs of production of electricity from wind generation,  cost of  transportation and delivery, wind farm  O&M, required wind farm construction time,  wind resource evaluation time,  reliability of production, methods of evaluation of the wind resource,  utilization percentages, reliability of equipment and service,  identification of optimal location,  optimal size of load to be serviced, potential financing terms and conditions, methods of structuring such deals,  tax credit use,  enhanced use leasing, or other material elements of such transactions, and all other aspects of the generation and delivery of wind power generation to GSA buildings and facilities. 

The Government is aware reports prepared by independent researchers on the Texas Renewable Portfolio Standards found that production from Texas wind farms is being sold under long term contracts for prices of 3 cents per kWh.  The Government seeks pricing at or near this level (exclusive of T&D) for use in its buildings and facilities.  GSA, Region 7, is willing to consider and evaluate a variety of transaction structures that may enable it to obtain this objective. The government may be willing to consider entering into long term power purchase contracts for up to ten years, or longer, in support of wind farm development, if contractual, technical, and other obstacles may be overcome, and if financial benefits to the government may be realized.

This is not a solicitation nor will a solicitation result from this notice or announcement.  If a formal solicitation notice is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. The purpose of this notice is to gauge the level of interest on the part of industry in participating in such a transaction and to discover industry viewpoints and capabilities pertaining to such transactions and the technical issues involved. The government invites interested parties to submit information regarding the matters identified in this notice, or other pertinent issues, to the government.  This information should be received by the government not later than October 28, 2005.  Further information may be obtained by contacting the government’s representative. No award will be made as a result of this notice. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the government.  This is merely an invitation by the government to industry to discuss these opportunities, issues and possibilities with the Government’s representative.  Once Industry comments and views have been received, and evaluated, the Government anticipates hosting the opportunity for a government/industry roundtable conference in Fort Worth to discuss and explore potential transactions. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any private sector input obtained as a result of this sources sought notice, and market survey.  For further information or discussions interested parties and industry participants are invited to contact Mr. Kevin Myles, Contracting Officer, GSA (7PMA) at (817) 978-9942 or by e-mail at:  kevin.myles@gsa.gov.

<CONTACT>Jim Frost at 850-235-5061, or Lawson Hynson at 850-234-4862
<DESC>The Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) Joint Program Office (JPO), at Panama City, Florida, is requesting information from industry for approaches in developing the En Route communications package for the DJC2 system.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the DJC2 JPO will contract for the concept contained within this RFI.  The DJC2 JPO will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only.  Responders should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accep! ted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The DJC2 JPO is responsible for developing the DJC2 system, a standardized, integrated, rapidly deployable, modular, scaleable, and reconfigurable Joint Command and Control (C2) and collaboration Joint Task Force (JTF) system of systems. The DJC2 capability integrates existing Government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software applications to provide its information technology (IT) functionality.  The Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J), a unique Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) system, provides DJC2’s core C2 software functionality.  The C2 applications and services are being integrated into a Collaborative Information Environment (CIE), enabling simultaneous, collaborative planning and execution, and shared battle space awareness and understanding.  The goal is to provide a seamless, shared information environment-supporting Joint, multinational, and interagency operations. DJC2 provides the interfaces with both DoD and commercial communication pathways to allow the Joint Force Commander to receive and disseminate information.  The DJC2 program is required to provide its C2 and collaboration capability on five separate networks – Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet), Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), and Non-Governmental Internet. A fully fielded DJC2 system includes:  GOTS C2 and COTS office automation and collaboration software applications with operator workstations; displays; intercommunications; local area networks; access to wide area networks; communications equipment (a limited amount to support autonomous En Route and nested early entry operations only); power; environmental control; shelters; infrastructure; and trailers. DJC2 is a multi-year, joint component, critical Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM program.  The DJC2 will field two systems to each of the four Regional Combatant Commands (RCC) in Increment I and two additional systems to each of the RCCs in Increment II. The DJC2 system design is based on a “Core” 60-operator positions using open systems architecture.  Key components of Core configurations may be combined for large-scale operations.  The Increment I DJC2 system will provide three distinct configurations:  an autonomous En Route configuration, a nested Early Entry configuration, and a Core configuration. En Route (ER) – Provides situational awareness and basic C2 capabilities using a Collaborative Information Environment (CIE) for the JFC and/or staff while en-route between in-garrison and deployed locations.  Consists of 10-20 operator positions, with standard network services and En Route communications (e.g., airborne En Route C2 pallet with airborne International Maritime Satellite [INMARSAT], and Tactical Satellite [TACSAT].  This RFI is an effort to identify and evaluate the capability of current commercially available technology to support the Increment I and Increment II En Route portion of the DJC2 system.  DJC2 is interested in “non-developmental”, currently existing systems that can provide the capabilities outlined in the En Route (ER) description above.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries.  Within NARA the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) works toward the goal of improving the economy, effectiveness and efficiency of NARA operations.  To that end and pursuant to the IG Act of 1978, as amended, (5 U.S.C. App. 3), the OIG conducts audits and investigations, both criminal and investigative, relating to all aspects of NARA operations to promote efficiency and prevent waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.

Currently the Office of Investigations within NARA’s OIG is utilizing several systems for tracking the various aspects of investigations.  These systems are not integrated, requiring multiple manual entries of redundant data, as well as manual compilation/calculation of data for management reporting.  Initially all complaints are entered into one system where they are evaluated to determine if there is a need for further investigation.  If further investigation is required the information is manually re-entered into another system for conducting the investigation.  Additional supporting information such as letters, emails, and other electronic or paper documents are stored separately in electronic archive folders or paper files.  These systems include commercial and custom desktop database applications, word-processing document archives, document logs, and paper based logs.

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e) this notice serves as a request for information. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.     This request is for a commercial established Case Management  planning System to meet the IT needs of NARA’s Office of Investigations and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.  NARA’s OIG is considering replacing the multiple automated and manual systems it is currently using to track investigations with a single automated system to capture, track and report on all aspects of an investigation.  The following business needs should be addressed in the contractor’s response to the RFI.
•	Single repository for all case related information.
•	Allow for multi user access.
•	Provide a easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI).
•	Standard and Ad hoc reporting capabilities.
•	Access security controls.
•	Configurability that allows field labels and messages to match the NARA OIG standard terminology.
•	Access to historical cases (complaints/investigations).
o	Once a case is closed there should be limited edit capability.
•	The ability to log all complaints received by the OIG regardless of the source.
•	The ability to create an investigation from a complaint.
o	The investigation number should be different from the complaint number, but the records should be linked.
o	All information from the complaint should be accessible and editable from the investigation.
•	Ability to assign cases to investigators.
•	Track information about investigators working a case.
•	The ability to input and track case milestones.
•	Track total time charged, as well as time charged by individual investigators to a case.
o	Track expenses associated with each case.
•	The ability to track the referral of cases to other agencies/organizations.
•	The ability to track recoveries associated with a case.
•	The ability to track Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests associated with a case.
•	Display chronologically the events associated with a case.
•	The ability to produce information to facilitate the preparation of the OIG’s Semi-Annual report to Congress.
•	Track investigators progress in meeting performance objectives.
•	Perform full text searches and retrieval of documents related to cases.
•	Provide the capability to scan supporting case notes and attach them to cases.
•	Support third party data interchange with products such as MS Word, Access and Excel.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) only.  The National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), is the research, development, and evaluation agency of the U.S. Department of Justice. NIJ provides objective, independent, evidence-based knowledge and tools to enhance the administration of justice and public safety.  NIJ does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. This RFI is issued solely to request capability statements from industry to be used for NIJ’s information and planning purposes to identify whether courts technology is a field that NIJ can contribute to if congressional funding is provided in the future.  No product demonstrations or marketing presentations will be scheduled as a result of this market research / information gathering announcement. Specifically, NIJ seeks through this RFI to capture the state of the art in commercial off-the-shelf hardware and/or software technology that provides solutions to the automation and integration needs of courts at the state and local level.

The NIJ is interested in obtaining from industry descriptive profiles of technologies that have application to the automation and integration needs of criminal courts at the state and local level. Respondents should provide a capability statement with high-level description of their technology’s capabilities with enough specificity to allow NIJ to understand the solution the respondent’s technology provides to the automation and integration needs of courts. Respondents are not requested to provide supporting technical data.  NIJ is interested, though not exclusively in technology that:

 (1) Builds system integration capability across the criminal justice arena and enables participating agencies associated with criminal and quasi-criminal cases to share information through systems designed for their individual operations;

 (2) Allows governments to alternatively reduce time to trial, and trial time, increase efficiency and effectiveness by eliminating the recording and transfer of documents by hand, permit electronic filing, or provide for quick retrieval of documents and allow individuals at different locations across the criminal justice arena to view documents collectively (while securing data from unauthorized access);

 (3)  Enables law enforcement agencies, judges, prosecutors, public defenders, defense attorneys, and court personnel to more effectively and efficiently manage criminal and quasi-criminal caseloads and court filings and orders, including administrative support tools that facilitate electronic case management and support electronic filing and docketing – with emphasis upon technology that permits seamless transfer of data between all agencies involved in the criminal justice process, from arresting agencies through corrections;

(4)   Enables law enforcement agencies, judges, prosecutors, public defenders, defense attorneys, and court personnel to more effectively and efficiently measure and manage organizational performance – with emphasis on such technology as business intelligence or performance measurement software solutions.

 (5)  Extends the ability of litigants in criminal cases to adequately prepare witnesses and participants in preliminary proceedings and court proceedings, such as automated witness preparation tools, litigation support tools to automate hearing and trial presentations, and automated litigation support tools that facilitate efficient use of scarce judicial resources;

 (6) Facilitates the requirements of due process, and helps automate and speed the preparation and presentation of applications for court processes, including (without limitation): subpoenas, arrest warrants, search warrants and other orders, and that can preserve testimony and any records relative to the applications and any hearings thereon and also permits remote access where appropriate to any parties relevant to the process; 

 (7)  Provides increased information access for attorneys, judges, law enforcement, and the public to court related information, including performance data (e.g., on-time case processing, case clearance, trial certainty, and backlog data), orders and rulings, both through the use of the internet or other relevant technology, also including but not limited to interactive kiosks (while securing data from unauthorized access);

To the extent possible this request seeks information on systems and tools that promote non-proprietary technologies and formats, and that incorporate, where possible, the Global Justice XML format.

Responses to this RFI should be submitted no later than August 15, 2005 in order to insure full consideration. The narrative section of your response should not exceed 7 double-spaced pages. Company information, abstract, table of contents, charts, figures, appendixes do not count toward the 7-page limit for the narrative section but should not increase the paper past a total of 10 pages. Product brochures may be attached to your response.  Responses should be sent via overnight express mail and/or e-mail attachment, and include the vendor’s company name, address, point of contact name, e-mail address, and telephone number.

<RESPDATE>082005

<DESC>The Army plans to privatize its transient lodging at substantially all of its installations throughout the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.  The Privatization of Army Lodging (PAL) office is responsible for accomplishing this goal.  Base d on prior Army success at privatizing family housing under the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) program, the PAL offices intent was to model this lodging privatization effort closely on the housing model.  Specifically, the PAL office intended to  utilize the Limited Liability Company (LLC) management structure.  Under RCI, the privatized housing project is controlled by the private sector managing member of the LLC and the Army retains a limited interest in that LLC.  Properly structured Army owne rship in the project entity can create significant tax advantages resulting in greater cash flow available for reinvestment into the project throughout the duration of the ground lease.   The PAL office has reason to believe that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will soon release a policy addressing 'scoring' of projects under the military housing privatization initiative authorities.  Scoring is an accounting convention that requi res the Government to quantify the present value of a financial obligation and then obligate funds to cover that liability.  Under the scoring guidelines likely to be applied by OMB, the PAL office anticipates that the Army will not be able to utilize the LLC structure in any lodging project.  Without the benefit of limited Army ownership, the PAL office is concerned that there will be tax consequences that would reduce the project's ability to substantially fund the capital improvement reserve account.    Consequently, the PAL office is conducting market research to gather input regarding strategies that would maximize contributions to the capital improvement reserve account while still providing an acceptable lodging product with room rates for official tr avelers that meet the requirement of an average rate not to exceed 75% of the lodging portion of per diem across the portfolio.  Although the Army will not be allowed to retain an ownership interest in lodging projects, the Army does still intend to engage  in a comprehensive Portfolio and Asset Management program.      Previously, the PAL office intended to combine facilities at several installations into a series of project groups, each of which would have been offered under separate solicitations.  However, given the recent developments described above, the PAL Office is now seriously evaluating the benefits of conducting a single solicitation for the entire program.     The PAL office is interested in receiving your feedback regarding strategies for maximizing contributions to the PAL reinvestment account while providing a quality lodging product within the rate limitations noted above, as well as comments regarding the p ossibility of offering the entire program as a single project.   Responses received by the Army will be held in confidence.  Responses may be provided via e-mail or by scheduling a meeting with Mark Piedmonte, Contract Specialist, from the PAL office through the following e-mail address mark.piedmonte@hqda.army.mil.  In  order to continue progress on this initiative, please submit your responses no later than August 20, 2005.    Thank you for your continuing interest.

<SUBJECT>65 -- CORE Drill System
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for a CORE Drill System to Stryker, 4100 E. Milham Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49001.  The CORE Drill System is necessary for the 55th Medical Group to satisfy mission requirements.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because Stryker is the manufacturer and only distributor of the CORE Drill System.  This system is the only one compatible with the existing equipment in the hospital.  The procurement of the drill system must be completed in a timely manner in order to meet mission requirements.  Questions should be directed to Jennifer Hoffman in writing via email:  jennifer.hoffman@offutt.af.mil or by fax:  (402) 294-7280.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number RFQ CC-05-17 applies and is issued as a request for quotation. This procurement is a unrestricted full and open competition for all qualified offerors. Attachments shall be forwarded to offeror by request. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-04 dated 6/8/2005 and NIH Policy Manual Issuance 6012-26012-1. Offerors are required to request attachments from the Contracting Officer, aargaman@cc.nih.gov.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 561720 and the business size standard is 12 million dollars. The Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health has a requirement for the continuation of housekeeping services at the Clinical Center complex at the National Institutes of Health which includes the Clinical Research (Hatfield Center), Building 10 (Warren Grant Magnuson Center) and the Ambulatory Care and Research Facility (ACRF) on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland for a period of 17 weeks (August 7, 2005-December 2, 2005).    Specialized housekeeping services are required for the Clinical Center Complex as fully described in the Statement of Work which is posted separately on this site.  The contractor shall have passed two consecutive surveys of the Joint Committee for Accreditation for Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) with no deficiencies in the housekeeping department at a present client hospital of more than 300 beds.      This is necessary due to the various types of tertiary acute medical care provided and the number of rare diseases treated at the Clinical Center.     The Clinical Center has an exemplary record of JCAHO surveys and cannot jeopardize its long standing record. Contractors shall comply with all applicable federal and state government regulations regarding control of infectious diseases in health care facilities. Contractors should consult the specific regulations for further details, exemptions, documentation, and record keeping requirements.   There are two objectives that the Clinical Center strives to meet. The first is to ensure that environmental services in the Clinical Center, the hospital at the NIH, meets nationally recognized guidelines for environmental infection control in order to maintain a safe, clean health care environment. A fundamental approach to achieve this primary objective is to clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and strictly adheres to good hygiene practices and procedures. Combined, these measures minimize the spread of microorganisms or germs in the hospital. The spread of microorganisms accounts for hospital-associated infections that may result in significant morbidity or mortality among patients and staff. The CC places a priority on proper cleaning and disinfecting “high touch” surfaces such as equipment and door knobs, bathroom fixtures, handrails, etc. that are shown to contribute to the spread of microorganisms in the hospital. This objective also includes proper maintenance of lower risk housekeeping surfaces such as floors, walls, and tabletops to maintain the safest possible environment for our patients as well as a satisfactory appearance and cleanliness within the facility that many dignitaries and individuals visit from around the world. The second objective is to maintain a satisfactory level of environmental services in the laboratories and support service areas, since these areas are critical, both to the effective operation of the hospital as well as the research mission of the NIH. These areas contain sophisticated, often one of a kind equipment and chemical, radioactive, and biological agents. This objective is to provide safe and effective environmental 





services in these areas through a combination of good work practice and training to mitigate the risk of both injury and exposures to hazardous materials or damage to government property. Because of the nature of the work performed, the CC considers requirements for workers as stated in this contract such as - orientation, training and pre-placement medical assessments - critical requirements for this contract. 

The contractor will be responsible for the cleaning of approximately 1,236,306 square feet of space that includes patient care areas, laboratories, exam rooms, public spaces and offices. The areas include 182,025 square feet of outside and garage space and 1,054,281 of interior space.    The interior space is further broken down to 260,218 square feet of level II space, 106,175 square feet of level III space, 468,339 square feet of level IV space and 219,489 square feet of level V space.  The definition of the levels is supplied in Table #1 which is part of the Statement of Work that is posted on this site..

MODEL 2004P COLORMASTER DIGITAL COLOR ANALYZER FOR 16MM AND 35MM MOTION PICTURE FILM. This solicitation requires the manufacture, delivery, and installation of a combination 16mm and 35mm motion picture film video analyzer.  The analyzer will be used in the manner standard within the motion picture industry for the electronic simulation of photographic processes such that judgments can be made regarding necessary exposure, filtration, etc., to obtain a final photographic product without going through the intermediate processes of test photographic exposures and photographic processing.  This specialized equipment will be used in the NARA Motion Picture Laboratory for analyzing valuable, often unique and irreplaceable, motion picture film encompassing all of the film elements or phases involved in normal motion picture production processes.  The equipment must handle motion picture film in various states of deterioration with great finesse and with sufficient attention to design detail to ensure an absolute minimum possibility of scratching, tearing, stressing, etc., motion picture film.  Major NARA goals in the use of this equipment are the analysis of motion picture film for various institutional purposes with a maximum of care and finesse in handling of the materials during the analysis process. 

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 

Analyzes 35mm, 16mm, and 16mm A/B motion picture roll film, color or black/white emulsion.
Operates in manual, auto-drive, or synchronous drive modes to permit manual advance of film through the analysis gate, motor driven advance for scene by scene viewing, and synchronous drive for properly synchronized video output.
Uses change couple devices (CCDs) as light sensors, rather than photo multipliers, in conjunction with color correction look up tables for enhanced long-term stability, accuracy, and versatility.
Interfaces directly with the BHP Inc. PCS II motion picture printer lamp houses used on NARA’s motion picture lab printers.
Uses a professional grade standard production video monitor, rather than a custom designed monitor with customized phosphors, thereby being more stable, repairable, upgradeable, and reliable.
Analyzes modern film emulsions and is easily updateable for new emulsions as they appear on the market.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.
