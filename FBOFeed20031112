<SOLNBR>14350404RP32695
<RESPDATE>112403
<ARCHDATE>11112004
<CONTACT>Melissa McPherson Contract Specialist 7037871354     Melissa.McPherson@mms.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The Department of Interior (DOI)/GovWorks, on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women?s Health (DHHS OWH), is seeking a potential contractor to undertake the enhancement and maintenance of the HeartHealthyWomen Website, a website that provides gender-based information on the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease in women. BACKGROUND:   The Office on Women's Health in the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS/OWH) has as its mission ?the improvement of women?s health across the lifespan by directing, developing, stimulating, and coordinating education and training across the agencies and offices of the Department of Health and Human Services and with other agencies and offices of the Department, and consumer and heath care professional groups.?  To that end, the DHHS/OWH has established public/private partnerships that address the health issues of heart disease and stroke in women.   Heart disease is the number one killer of women in the United States.  More women die from heart disease than men, and recent research has shown disparities in the treatment for heart disease among women as compared to men.  On April 25, 2002,  the Assistant Secretary for Health testified before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, and labor and Subcommittee on Public health and outlined four priorities for the Office on Women?s Health over the next 18 months:  Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Cancer, and HIV/AIDS.  This contract will address the first two of these priorities by maintaining and expanding a website that provides state-of-the-science diagnosis, prevention and treatment  information for women and their providers.  The goal is to help reduce the rate of mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease in women. The HeartHealthyWomen.org Website was created to provide comprehensive gender-based information on cardiovascular disease in women.  It features separate educational sections for patients and healthcare providers on the most up-to-date research on detection, accurate diagnoses, and appropriate treatment of cardiovascular disease in women.  Information offered on the website includes: 1) the most important signs, symptoms, and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in women; 2) treatment disparities, mortality, and complications in women with cardiovascular disease; (2) the specificity and accuracy of diagnostic tests for women as well as the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical and medical device treatments appropriate for women; and (3) ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial access based on actively enrolling centers and sponsors.   SCOPE OF WORK:  The Office on Women?s Health (OWH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is looking to expand the content and infrastructure of the HeartHealthywomen.org Website.  This will be Phase II, the final phase, of a project for this website.  The previous phase was awarded to and completed by WomenHeart and the Cardiovascular Research Foundation.  This new contract will enable the HeartHealthyWomen.org website to offer gender-based information for patients and healthcare providers simultaneously on a broad range of topics relevant to women with both Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), including early disease detection, accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment.  The website will be searchable by relevant topic identification based on the outline above and will also offer current and ongoing clinical trial information, as well as clinical trial centers based on regional location.  Thus, this website will provide unique access to the most up-to-date gender-based medical information on treatments that are proven to impact outcomes and mortality among women.  OWH is seeking a contractor to successfully complete the second phase of this website in accordance with the Statement of Work for the project. The period of performance of the resultant contract will be approximately 12 months including project initiation, delivery of a market-ready program, and maintenance of the site.  The estimated range for this project is $85,000 to $95,500.  The Government anticipates a time and materials contract. A draft Statement of Work for this project will be posted at http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp under the RFP Number 14350404RP32695 on or about November 12, 2003.  The Statement of Work includes additional information for Offerors regarding the full scope of the project.  Offerors are encouraged to thoroughly review the draft Statement of Work before submitting capability statements. This project will be competed in two Phases.  Phase I will be the submission of Capabilities Statements.  Phase II will be the submission of Proposals. IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT, Offerors must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 3:00PM Eastern Time, November 24, 2003, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:  (1) your experience and commitment of key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the work) and their qualifications and specific demonstrable experience in expanding the content and infrastructure of health-related websites, their experience, education, and professional credentials on similar projects and in related fields, and the appropriateness of each person?s skills for the specific tasks in the Statement of Work;  (2) your organizational experience in expanding the content and infrastructure of health related websites, specifically, offerors will be evaluated on their previous experience designing a comprehensive website devoted to women and heart disease as well as the ability to partner with an organization that represents women heart disease patients;  and (3) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & telephone number) for previous related work in health website development that your key personnel or organization have successfully performed within the last two years.  If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem. After review of all Capabilities Statements, those Offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be provided additional proposal instructions and contract requirements.  GovWorks intends to notify Offerors approximately 10 days after receipt of capability statements, of whether or not they are considered ?Best Qualified.?  Each Offeror?s Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on the following:  Factors A and B which are in descending order of importance.  Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other. A) EXPERIENCE AND KEY PERSONNEL? This covers the qualifications of key personnel proposed to perform the work and the amount of effort estimated for each person.  This evaluation is based on the following:  experience, education, and professional credentials of proposed key personnel on similar projects and in related fields; appropriateness of each person?s skills for the specific tasks in the RFP; and adequacy of the proposed level of effort estimated for each work category.  B) ORGANIZATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ? This factor will be evaluated by considering the number, size, and complexity of similar projects that the offeror has previously successfully completed.  Also evaluated will be the offeror?s adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products.  Offerors will be evaluated on their previous experience designing a Web site that provides comprehensive information on cardiovascular disease in women for both patients and health care professionals as well as their ability to partner with an organization that represents women heart disease patients.  REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED.  Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in 1 original and 2 copies as well as an electronic copy via email to Melissa McPherson, Contract Specialist, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817.   In addition, Offerors shall include one electronic copy on CD-ROM with their submitted hard copies.  Email copies are to be emailed to melissa.mcpherson@mms.gov .  Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia.  Questions should be e-mailed to melissa.mcpherson@mms.gov .   Questions regarding the Capabilities Phase of this project shall be submitted no later than November 20, 2003.  Questions received along with their corresponding answers will be posted as an amendment to this Announcement on the FedBizOpps website on November 21, 2003.   All correspondence shall include this RFP number (14350404RP32695), full name/company name, address, phone and fax numbers, and point of contact email address. Requests or questions by telephone will not be accepted or acknowledged.

<ARCHDATE>11112004
<CONTACT>Melissa McPherson Contract Specialist 7037871354     Melissa.McPherson@mms.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The Department of Interior (DOI)/GovWorks, on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women?s Health (DHHS OWH), is seeking a potential contractor to undertake the enhancement and maintenance of the For Your Heart Website on the National Women?s Health Information Center website. BACKGROUND:   The Office on Women's Health in the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS/OWH) has as its mission ?the improvement of women?s health across the lifespan by directing, developing, stimulating, and coordinating education and training across the agencies and offices of the Department of Health and Human Services and with other agencies and offices of the Department, and consumer and heath care professional groups.?  To that end, the DHHS/OWH has established public/private partnerships that address the health issues of heart disease and stroke in women.  One such partnership is with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s Heart Truth Campaign, which is targeting high-risk women aged 40-60 years, through a national PSA education campaign. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among American women and the number one killer among women of color in the United States.  More women die from heart disease than men, and recent research has shown disparities in the treatment for heart disease among women as compared to men.  It is essential to educate women about the risk of CVD because modification of risk factors at any stage of cardiovascular disease can result in a significant improvement in health outcomes. During the last 4 years, the DHHS/OWH has developed a cardiovascular disease prevention Web site, tailored for women according to their race or ethnicity.  This Web site is called For Your Heart (http://www.4woman.gov/hhs), and it can be found on the National Women's Health Information Center Web site (http://www.4woman.gov). The theoretical basis of the For Your Heart initiative is the Stages of Change model, which proposes that changes in health behavior are not discrete events, but involve a progression through a continuum of behavior change readiness.  Specifically, an individual?s degree of behavior change typically reflects one of the five stages.  In each of the stages, a person has to address a different set of issues and tasks that relate to their risk behavior. The five stages of the model are: Pre-contemplation; Contemplation; Preparation; Action; and Maintenance (Prochaska, J.O., DiClemente, C.C., Norcross, J.C., 1992). SCOPE OF WORK:  The Office on Women?s Health (OWH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is looking to undertake the enhancement and maintenance of the For Your Heart Website.  This will be Phase IV, the final phase, of a project for this website.  The previous three phases were awarded to and completed by MicroMass Communications, Inc.  This phase of the project will be competed as a small business set-aside.  The For Your Heart Web site provides a personalized and interactive healthcare education experience, utilizing a unique tailoring technology and development process.  The program engages women in a Web site dialogue with the objective of building their personal knowledge about heart disease, with special attention given to minorities on the impact of diabetes on heart disease.  This site builds a unique relationship by asking a series of questions and tailoring subsequent messages based on specific risk factors and readiness to change.  OWH is seeking a contractor to successfully complete the final phase of this website in accordance with the Statement of Work for the project. The period of performance of the resultant contract will be approximately 12 months including project initiation, delivery of a market-ready program, and maintenance of the site.

After review of all Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be provided additional proposal instructions and contract requirements.  GovWorks intends to notify offerors approximately 10 days after receipt of capability statements, of whether or not they are considered ?Best Qualified.?  Each offeror?s Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on the following:  Factors A and B which are in descending order of importance.  Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other. A) EXPERIENCE AND KEY PERSONNEL?

B) ORGANIZATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ?

Also evaluated will be the offeror?s adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products.

<DESC>Cognitive Information Processing Technology, SOL BAA 02-21, Abstracts Due: April 4, 2003, Proposals Due: Friday, June 6, 2003 POC: Dr. Ronald J. Brachman and Mr. Zachary J. Lemnios, DARPA/IPTO; FAX: (703) 741-7804.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for research in the area of cognitive information processing technology.  DARPA's Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) seeks proposals to perform innovative research and development on cognitive systems and technologies that offer significant advances in performance and other relevant metrics above and beyond extrapolations of current approaches.  Proposed research should investigate novel approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Cognitive systems have a number of differentiating characteristics, but in short, they can be characterized as systems that know what they are doing.  Such systems will have the ability to reason about their environment (including other systems), their goals, and their own capabilities; this reasoning will be able to take advantage of substantial amounts of appropriately represented knowledge.  Cognitive systems will be able to learn both from their experiences and by being taught.  They will be capable of natural interaction with humans, and will be able to explain their reasoning in natural terms.  They will be able to form teams that succeed at goals that cannot be achieved as individuals.  And, notably, they will be robust in the face of surprises provided by the environment; the avoidance of the "brittleness" of the expert systems of the past will be a distinguishing feature.  All technologies and approaches that enable the creation, demonstration and implementation of advanced cognitive information processing techniques are of potential interest under this BAA, including cross-disciplinary approaches that combine both innovative hardware and software to create unique computing technologies.  Applications of new cognitive information processing technology and systems are also of interest, in the form of stand-alone systems; mobile platforms; and deeply embedded, integrated components.  DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas: Computational Perception:  Technologies developed under this area of interest will serve as the information processing interface between sensors or other interfaces to the external environment and the underlying computational processes in a cognitive system.  Of interest are computational processes and embodiments that use a cognitive system's knowledge and experience to influence its perceptual capabilities in a way that provides revolutionary improvement in its abilities to detect important objects, events, and situations in its environment.  Representation and Reasoning: This area of interest seeks to create pragmatically adequate and mathematically well-founded knowledge representation formalisms and reasoning processes to support the entire range of cognitive information processing demands.  Approaches that allow a computational system to reflect on its own capabilities and performance and to use such reflection to improve performance and solve more difficult problems are of particular interest.  Learning: This area seeks to develop technologies for machines that learn that are sufficient for measurable improvements of basic functionality through the accumulation of experience.  Communications and Interaction Technology: This area seeks to develop technologies related to advanced interfaces between cognitive systems, legacy systems, and humans.  Of special interest are capabilities that allow cognitive systems to be instructed, guided, and persuaded using natural human-oriented communications (e.g., natural language, pictures, gestures).  Cognitive Architectures and Integrated Cognitive Agents: Systems that integrate the cognitive capabilities of reasoning, learning, explaining, ability to be advised, self awareness and robust coping with surprise are of interest, especially such systems that exhibit capabilities substantially beyond those achievable with conventional technology.  Significant contributions to the understanding of system architectures adequate to produce functional artificial cognitive systems are also of interest.  Robust Software and Hardware: This area seeks to develop novel structures and architectures for software and hardware platforms that facilitate the building and operation of robust, secure cognitive systems.  New technology for innovative fault-tolerant and secure software and hardware infrastructure in the context of cognitive systems and teams of such systems is of interest.  Cognitive Teams: This area seeks innovative ideas for creating and managing multi-agent systems that can achieve goals in a coordinated way.  Such systems can include multiple artificial cognitive agents, humans, and non-cognitive components.  Technology that facilitates successful performance of ad hoc teams or networks is of interest.  Underlying Foundations: This area seeks to establish fundamental scientific and mathematical foundations for cognitive computing areas for which none exist or where those that do are inadequate.  Areas of direct interest include, but are not limited to, the following: innovative ideas, concepts, and approaches to determine the most effective machine, information system, and network architectures for cognitive computing for different tasks and contexts; technologies inspired by biological systems that might provide cognitive systems with a more appropriate computing basis than conventional von Neumann platforms; scientific and technical advances in the understanding and implementation of trust relationships among autonomous cognitive systems.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Special Areas of Interest section of the BAA Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Multiple awards are anticipated.  Offerors submitting an abstract should include an estimate of costs based on the anticipated level of effort and associated costs to accomplish the work described.  Abstracts and proposals will be reviewed as received and funding decisions made following each review.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state of the art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposed research should contribute substantially towards the goals stated and include interim and final measurable milestones.  Where relevant, research should result in prototype software and/or hardware demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in incremental improvement to the existing state of practice.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve multiple research groups or industrial cooperation.  GENERAL INFORMATION: This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) strongly advocates submission of an abstract prior to submission of a full proposal.  Furthermore, responses require completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Abstract/Proposal prior to submission.  This cover sheet can be accessing at the following URL: http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-21.  After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Abstract/Proposal.  If a proposer intends on submitting more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES: The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  ABSTRACT FORMAT: In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts, in accordance with the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), in advance of full proposals.  Proposers must submit original and 4 hard copies of the abstract and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the proposal abstract (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-21, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and "Copy (Number) of 2".  The abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/IPTO, ATTN: BAA 02-21, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714, in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (EDT) Friday, April 4, 2003.  PROPOSAL FORMAT: Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-21, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and "Copy (Number) of 2".  BAA 02-21, Cognitive Information Processing Technology will remain open until 12:00 NOON (EDT) Friday, June 6, 2003.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Friday, June 6, 2003.  Proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding is reduced as fiscal year ceilings are reached.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-21 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstracts, and full proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/index.html.  Abstracts and proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-21 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling. The technical concept should be clearly defined, developed and defensibly innovative. Emphasis should be placed on the technical excellence of the development and experimentation approach.  (2) Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem:  Proposed efforts should apply new or existing technology in an innovative way such as is advantageous to the objectives.  The plan on how the offeror intends to get developed technology artifacts and information to the user community should be considered.  The offeror shall specify quantitative experimental methods and metrics by which the proposed technical effort's progress shall be measured.  (3) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/IPTO Mission: The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will meet the goals of the undertaking and how the proposed effort contributes to significant advances to the DARPA/IPTO mission.  (4) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience: The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.  (5) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition: The offeror should provide a clear explanation of how the technologies to be developed will be transitioned to capabilities for military forces.  Technology transition should be a major consideration in the design of experiments, particularly considering the potential for involving potential transition organizations in the experimentation process.  (6) Cost Realism: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be clearly shown as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation will consider the value to Government of the research and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.  Cost is considered a substantial evaluation criterion but secondary to technical excellence.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or proposal to this BAA, must be received at one of the administrative addresses below by 12:00 NOON (EST) Friday, May 30, 2003; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for some of the correspondence regarding BAA 02-21.  Proposals and proposal abstracts MUST NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor.  This support contractor is prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only."  While non-government personnel may review proposals, contractors will not be used to conduct evaluations or analyses of any aspect of a proposal submitted under this BAA, unless one of the three conditions identified in FAR 37.203(d) applies.

<CONTACT>Lori M. Levine, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 286-2533, Fax (301) 286-0383, Email Lori.M.Levine@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a contract on a sole-source basis to Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) at Dulles, Virginia to modify the OSC VCL spacecraft to accommodate the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS), Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM), and a cloud camera for the Glory mission, which is scheduled to launch in December 2006.  This procurement also includes the ground system requirements for the mission.  The Glory project requires a spacecraft that can accommodate both a nadir-pointing instrument and a stellar pointing instrument that utilizes a pointing platform.	There can be no spacecraft structure that causes appreciable stray light problems for the instruments.  It is necessary that the spacecraft can provide a minimum of 204 watts of power for the instruments.  With the instruments fully integrated, the spacecraft must fit into the Taurus 2110 launch vehicle.  The mass of the spacecraft cannot exceed 400 kilograms, wet mass, in order to have at least 30 percent of mass contingency with the prescribed launch vehicle.  The first mode of the spacecraft, with instruments, must be in excess of 100 hertz in order to meet Taurus launch load requirements.  The Glory spacecraft, with instruments, must fit into the Taurus 63-inch diameter shroud, with appropriate volume margin.  The Glory spacecraft needs to be dual string.  A minimum of three years of lifetime is required.     The Glory spacecraft must be three-axes stabilized.  It must have a minimum of four reaction wheels for redundancy.  It needs to have a GPS receiver to determine altitude and provide a stable clock.  The attitude control system for the spacecraft must meet or exceed pointing requirements of 60 arcsecond rms of knowledge and 30 arcsecond of control.  It must meet or exceed the jitter requirement of 15 arcsecond per second.  The spacecraft must provide area for a radiator to cold space in order to provide radiative cooling for infrared detectors. The Glory spacecraft must have a propulsion unit that allows it to fly in formation with the NPOESS Preparatory Platform (NPP), and to lower its altitude sufficiently, at end of life, in order to meet the requirement for re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere after 25 years.   The Glory ground system must be compatible with an existing commercial ground station network, such as Datalynx, that has high-latitude ground stations and that can directly interface to the Glory Mission Operation Center and Science Operation Centers.  It must have existing high-speed data links to GSFC.  It must be fully capable of supporting integration and testing and ground operations, using the same software systems, database, procedures, displays, and operators for each function.  The provider must be capable of maintaining spacecraft on-orbit performance and trending the subsystems for health, safety and performance.  It must be capable of single-shift Monday through Friday operation and unattended weekend operation, while providing appropriate alarms to on-call personnel. NASA/GSFC intends to conduct this procurement with OSC based upon 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source.  Only OSC has the heritage to modify the VCL spacecraft to meet the Glory mission requirements, and to provide integration and testing and ground systems support for the mission, within the mission schedule.  However, interested organizations that believe they can meet the spacecraft and ground system requirements for the Glory mission without any detrimental impact to the integration, test, and launch schedules may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort, in writing, to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 28, 2003.  These capability statements will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses to the synopsis received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement on a full and open basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  See Note 22.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA here is a summary: This project will construct a new stormwater sewer system in the Eighth Addition Subdivision in the City of Ishpeming, Marquette County, Michigan.   Most of the combined sewers in the City of Ishpeming were separated in the 1970s and 1980s.  Sewers in the Eighth Addition Subdivision, which comprises about 15 percent of the cityÃ¢Â€Â™s area, were not separated because of funding limitations.  The proposed action is to construct a new storm sewer system, leaving the existing sewer system to handle sanitary se wage only.  The proposed storm sewer would drain southward into an unnamed tributary of Carp Creek, which is currently used for storm water discharge by the City of Ishpeming, and northward into lowlands associated with Teal Lake.   This would preclude ove rflows of untreated water into neighboring waterways.

<DESC>NA The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving proposals for research focusing on the areas of Cleanup, Compliance, Conservation, Pollution Prevention, and Unexploded Ordna nce technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Proposers should state in their proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA. Readers should note that this is an announcement to decla re DoD/SERDPÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to competitively fund research and development for innovative and new environmental technologies that meet the focus areas set forth in the SERDP Program Announcement. The Program Announcement can be found on the DoD/SERDP Home P age accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.serdp.org/funding/nonfed. No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. Before preparing a proposal, potential proposers should read the information provided in the SERDP Program Announcement for details regarding proposal submission, the evaluatio n of proposals, and the individual Statements of Need (SON). Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals nor travel to present oral pr esentations in support of the proposals. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a preproposal white paper, including a signed original copy, plus six (6) additional copies to: Ms. Brenda Batch, SERDP P rogram Office, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 303, Arlington, VA 22203-1821, 703-696-2127. Preproposal white papers sent via fax or electronic mail will be rejected. White papers must be received no later than 4:00 PM EST on Thursday, January 8, 2004. They  must be in abstract form describing the merits and objectives of the proposerÃ¢Â€Â™s project. The abstract should concisely describe what the proposer has to offer the SERDP Program and discuss (1) the proposed objective(s) and approach with a clear ident ification of overall innovation and scientific/ technical merits; (2) the proposerÃ¢Â€Â™s capabilities and related experience, or unique combination of these which are integral factors in achieving a proposed objective; and (3) the qualifications and exper ience of the principal investigator(s), team leader(s), or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal. Preproposal white papers should be no longer than five pages (not including the cover page), single sided, and 11 point. One attachment of up to three single sided pages of test data may also be submitted. The cover page must be completed and entered via the website at https://sems.serdp-estcp.org/index.jsp  in the format specified in the Instructions. At a minimum, the prep roposal white papers should contain: (1) a title, descriptive of the research to be performed; (2) the name and address of the individual, company or educational institution submitting the white paper; (3) the abstract of the technical objective and descri ption of the approach including how the approach described satisfies the focused need in the SON; (4) the duration of the project along with a milestone chart with significant events; (5) the estimated labor cost, materials cost, burdens, and profit (if an y) by year; and (6) a one page curriculum vitae of the Principal Investigator(s) (not included in the five page preproposal count). Based upon the preproposal white paper evaluation by the Government, a submitter may be contacted for further information an d may be encouraged to submit a full proposal by a set time and date. The format requirements for the full proposal are set forth in the Program Announcement on  the DOD SERDP Home Page. Each of the white paper submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal. The white paper review step allows interested organizations to get initial Govern ment feedback on their technologies without the expense of a full proposal. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular SON. It i s expected that awards totaling approximately $2.0 million will result. White papers and full proposals will be evaluated against the following factors, listed in descending order of importance: (1) SERDP relevance (PASS/FAIL) - whether the submission resp onds to high-priority, mission relevant, DoD and DOE environmental requirements as described in the SON; (2) the approach, objective(s) and overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed technology; (3) potential for transition of the proposed res earch; (4) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposed objectives; (5) realism of the proposed cost, and availability of funds; and (6) av ailability of other financial support for the proposed effort. For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, HUD Zone small business, small dis advantaged business, woman owned small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, Veteran Owned and Disabled Veteran Owned small business and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAISC) code is 541 710 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. In addition, contract proposals that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting  Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The point of contact for this BAA for technical issues is Ms. Brenda Batch, SERDP Program Office, 703-696-2127 and for non-technical issues is Mr. James F. Bowers, HECSA, 703-428-7406.

<RESPDATE>060603
<CONTACT>Ronald Brachman, Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO), Phone none, Fax (703) 741-7804, Email none
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The above referenced BAA is modified to include a new Focal Challenge: "An Enduring, Personalized, Cognitive Assistant (EPCA)."  During the life of the BAA, other Focal Challenges may be introduced.  The EPCA Focal Challenge is an addition to the areas of interest described in the basic BAA, which include Computational Perception, Representation and Reasoning, Learning, Communications and Interaction Technology, Cognitive Architectures and Integrated Cognitive Agents, Robust Software and Hardware, Cognitive Teams, and Underlying Foundations. The intent of this Focal Challenge is to drive the creation of a new class of integrated, highly functional cognitive systems, central to the technical mission of this BAA and demonstrating the enabling technical elements (reasoning, learning, etc.) for new classes of cognitive information processing applications, as discussed in this BAA.  The Enduring Personal Cognitive Assistant will be set in an office context and will act like a personal executive assistant to a modern knowledge-worker or decision-maker.  The Assistant should demonstrate a number of key capabilities:  continuous learning over significant periods of time (months, if not years), and the ability to survive "injury," intermediate failure and even complete shutdown, whether intentional or inadvertent; this includes the retention of information and skills through system failure and shutdown (Enduring); the capability of autonomous as well as supervised learning, including learning by observing a partner or by being told something directly (at any natural level of abstraction) (Personalized); the capability to have and use domain and task knowledge; the capacity to be aware of events as they transpire and of the Assistant's own place in the world; the ability to have and remember experiences of its own, and to integrate perceptual input with longer-term knowledge; the ability to explain its reasoning and behavior in natural terms to its partner; and the ability to decide what to do and to act in real time (Cognitive); the capability of cooperating in a team or multi-agent situation; the capacity to interact in a multi-modal, broad spectrum way with humans (including natural language); the ability to be available everywhere; and the capacity to develop the degree of trust necessary for successful everyday interaction with a human partner (Assistant).  The Assistant must display basic competencies, including interaction with people and other assistant programs in a normal office environment; sending and receiving information in a human-like manner; relating office information and activities contained or described in one medium in a meaningful manner to office information and activities contained or described in another medium (e.g., relating email to calendar entries, phone messages to trips, etc.); and integration with off-the-shelf office technology solutions and applications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Navigator).  Our vision is of an Assistant likely to be dedicated to a single person and working intimately with that person over a prolonged period of time (i.e., months).  In this long-term setting, the Assistant would observe the behavior of its partner and determine his/her habits and likes and dislikes, for example preferences in travel, information presentation, mail-reading behavior, appointment scheduling, etc.  The system must be able to respond to user feedback (either direct or implicit).  The Assistant should be able to accept direct natural language direction and advice, ranging, for example, from very specific orders to make a plane reservation to general rules of thumb about scheduling appointments.  We would ultimately like the Assistant to be accessible naturally and seamlessly in any environment and modality.  The Assistant must be capable of learning and reasoning - for example, learning new office procedures by being trained or directed by a human partner or ultimately, by reading a dohe PAL performing contractors will prepare and execute the Year 1 evaluation, and have continuing execution responsibilities in their contracts.  The CSE offeror will independently monitor and validate the evaluations.  
Task 4: Analyze and Interpret Results:  No modification to Task 4 above. 
Milestones of the Cognitive Systems Evaluation Offeror for the PAL Program.  Proposals submitted in response to the CSE Focal Challenge must specifically address milestones at the annual PAL anniversary points (May of 2004 through 2008).  Proposals must discuss the use of phase or option years, to include fully defining the meaning of phase or option years.  Base and phase or option years must be fully priced, to the extent possible.  Deliverables, milestones, and demonstrations must be included and clearly defined with links to the Statement of Work.  Proposers may propose a multi-organizational but integrated team. Submitted proposals must clearly discuss the offeror’s planned approach to the sharing of information and responsibilities with each PAL performer and other members of its own team.   Each team will test their PAL systems against separate test problems.  The Cognitive Systems Evaluation offeror, as an independent third party, will design, develop, and audit the test procedures for both teams.   
The period of performance of this contract to support the PAL program is anticipated to be approximately 57 months, commencing with award early in FY 04, and completing with full analysis of the Year 5 evaluations.  The periods of performance, detailed delivery schedules, and analytical products for evaluation of additional programs will be separately negotiated.  Intentions are to award a single contract for the Cognitive Systems Evaluation function for the PAL evaluation tenure, although multiple awards might be considered for added IPTO program evaluations. Teaming with multiple entities, particularly if specific areas of expertise are enhanced through the teaming process, is encouraged, though not mandatory.  See the PIP for further information such as the qualifications of personnel. The funding level for this project will be phased to meet the schedule of evaluation.  The first phase will be from contract award through June of 04 and is estimated to be funded at approximately $500k. Thereafter, each phase year is estimated to be funded not more than $1 million, and will be phased to coincide with annual evaluations, including the quick look analysis following the examinations.  
The evaluation factors listed in the basic PIP will remain in effect for this modification. The proposal must specifically address the proposer and team members’ Intellectual Property rights, Government rights to Intellectual Property resulting from the research, and the methods to be used to meaningfully exchange possibly proprietary information among the awardees.  The proposer must specifically address the use of human subjects, if any, at any point during the life of the project.  Further details regarding these requirements are referenced in the PIP.  Although proposals identified for funding under this Focal Challenge may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction, depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors, the Government anticipates awarding only contracts in order to maintain the desired level of control over this research.  
GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Government intends to use non-Government personnel to assist as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation. Support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose. Contractor personnel are required to sign Organizational Conflict of Interest/Non-Disclosure Agreements. By submission of its proposal, each offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above. Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.  For those proposals submitted directly in response to this modification to BAA 02-21, Focal Challenge: Cognitive Systems Evaluation, a submission date of 12:00 NOON (ET), 12 December 2003 is established for consideration during the initial evaluation phase.  Proposal cover sheets, as described in the basic BAA and Proposer’s Information Pamphlet, should indicate the Cognitive Systems Evaluation Focal Challenge as the BAA technology area for which the proposal is submitted.  Proposals should be submitted to the addresses contained in the basic BAA.  The 12 December 2003 submission date applies only to proposals submitted in response to the CSE Focal Challenge.  Due to the extremely short submission time, no abstracts responding to the CSE Focal Challenge are required or will be accepted.  All other submission requirements, formatting requirements, and reporting requirements remain the same as found in the initial solicitation describing the BAA.  Offerors are still encouraged to submit other proposals addressing the issues in the basic BAA and to periodically check the Federal Business Opportunities and the IPTO Solicitation web page for possible new Focal Challenges and other modifications.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) in response to this Focal Challenge must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 noon (ET) Friday, 12 December 2003, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-21 will remain open until 12:00 noon (ET) Monday, June 7, 2004.  Thus, proposals for this Focal Challenge may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA amendment through Monday, June 7, 2004. While the proposals submitted after the Friday, 12 December 2003, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is significantly less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule for this Focal Challenge.

<DESC>This modification extends the following submission deadlines and makes the other changes for BAA 02-21: Abstracts - 12:00 Noon (ET), Monday, April 5, 2004; Administrative correspondence and questions - 12:00 Noon (ET), Monday, May 31, 2004; Proposals - 12:00 Noon (ET), Monday, June 7, 2004; and Proposal abstract recommendations - will attempt to review within 90 days after receipt.  References in the BAA requiring the submission of an "original and 4 hard copies" are changed to read "an original and 1 hard copy."  The requirement that submissions be formatted "72 characters to the line, 60 lines to the page" is deleted.  Any 12-point font is acceptable.  All proposals, proposal abstracts, administrative correspondence, and questions submitted in response to this solicitation must be in the English language.  Submissions received in other than English shall be rejected.cument describing those procedures.  As is a good human assistant, the artificial assistant should be capable of proactively accessing and using electronic information sources locally and on the Internet, for example, to prepare appropriate materials in advance of a meeting.  The Assistant must be robust in the face of uncertainty, being able to successfully cope with unanticipated external and possibly disruptive events.  The intent of the EPCA Focal challenge is to foster a cross-disciplinary integrated approach that significantly advances the state of the art both at the system level and in core technology.  It is essential that technologies and components developed in the course of this research be general enough to lend themselves to other applications (portability to other cognitive applications) - the goal (as is the goal of the entire BAA) is to create powerful and reusable cognitive information processing technologies and techniques rather than simply to create an ad hoc assistant system that serves only as a demonstration.  However, successful integration of the cognitive information processing technologies and components into a working overall system is paramount.  It is anticipated that there will be multiple awards, which will be reviewed at the 12-month milestone, to include a Preliminary Design Review and demonstration for determining continuation of the technological thrust being reviewed through the next milestones.  Proposals submitted in response to the EPCA Focal Challenge must specifically address milestones at the 12-, 24- and 36-month points.  At the 12-month milestone, for example, the contractor might address the analysis and development of the initial domain knowledge base; the types of learning algorithms needed to learn procedures and preferences by observation; the specification of the architecture for overall reasoning, decision-making, and learning for the system; and demonstrate elementary meeting scheduling capabilities and conflict resolution, and basic entity and event extraction from email and voicemail transcripts and correlation of such entities and events with calendar entries.  Continuing the example, at the 24-month milestone, the contractor might demonstrate simple advice-taking behavior; deeper integration of information across calendars, email, voicemail, etc.; simple preference-inferring behavior; rudimentary modification of information presentation based on stated or inferred user preferences, using confirmatory dialogues; and the initial interaction with other software agents and online sources.  At the 36-month milestone, to complete the example, the contractor might demonstrate natural language dialogue-based interaction; proactive information-seeking and preparation of appropriate materials in advance of events needing them (e.g., meetings); general reflective problem-solving to cope with unforeseen events and constraints; and more sophisticated interface behavior around modifications based on inference (e.g., non-annoyance of the user).  The establishment of milestones, while at the discretion of the proposer, should clearly provide demonstrable results of the research and integration cumulatively achieved by the team at the milestone described.  Proposals must discuss the use of phase or option years, to include fully defining the meaning of phase or option years.  Base and phase or option years must be fully priced, to the extent possible.  Deliverables, milestones, and demonstrations must be included and clearly defined with links to the Statement of Work.  Proposers must propose a multi-organizational but integrated team comprising a Lead System Integration (LSI) function and a set of Technology Focus Centers (TFC's).  The LSI function will have overall project management responsibility, to include chief architect and interface control functions, system integration of concepts from the TFC's, and concept validation and evaluation processes.  Technology Focus Centers themselves should be multi-organizational, and must reflect a broad and deep representation from the technical community with unique and enabling capabilities for each major technical sub-area of this Focal Challenge; they should participate in the design of all versions of the Assistant system built by the Lead System Integrator, recommend technology elements to the Lead System Integrator, and develop technology elements for all iterations of the architecture and technology concepts for all systems envisioned by the proposal.  All proposals must address the inclusion and use of a Technology Transition Committee, comprising DARPA representatives and LSI and TFC representatives.   Submitted proposals must clearly discuss the offeror's planned approach to the sharing of information and responsibilities within each Technology Focus Center and between Technology Focus Centers and Lead System Integrators.  The proposal must specifically address the proposer and team members' Intellectual Property rights, Government rights to Intellectual Property resulting from the research, and the methods to be used to meaningfully exchange possibly proprietary information among the awardees at the Lead System Integrator level and within the various LSI Integrator and TFC teams.  The proposer must specifically address the use of human subjects, if any, at any point during the life of the project.  If human subjects are not to be used, a statement of that fact must be included.  If human subjects are to be used at any time in the project, the proposer must meet all requirements of Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 46 Protection of Human Subjects, effective 13 December 2001, Department of Health and Human Services.  The Common Rule (Federal Policy) for the Protection of Human Subjects (56 FR 28003) may also be found at 32 CFR Part 219, Department of Defense.  If human subjects are to be used at any time during the project, the proposal must include Industrial Review Board (IRB) approval for the use of human subjects, or a plan for obtaining IRB approval for the use of human subjects prior to the use of the human subjects.  Although proposals identified for funding under this Focal Challenge may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors, the Government anticipates awarding only contracts in order to maintain the desired level of control over this research.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  For those proposals submitted directly in response to this modification to BAA 02-21, Focal Challenge: Enduring, Personalized, Cognitive Assistant, a submission date of 12:00 NOON (ET), 19 December 2002 is established for consideration during the initial evaluation phase.  Proposal cover sheets, as described in the basic BAA and Proposer's Information Pamphlet, should indicate the EPCA Focal Challenge as the BAA technology area for which the proposal is submitted.  Proposals should be submitted to the addresses contained in the basic BAA.  The 19 December 2002 submission date applies only to proposals submitted in response to the Focal Challenge.  Due to the extremely short submission time, no abstracts responding to the Focal Challenge are required or will be accepted.  All other submission requirements, formatting requirements, and reporting requirements remain the same as found in the initial solicitation describing the BAA.  Offerors are still encouraged to submit other proposals addressing the issues in the basic BAA and to periodically check the Federal Business Opportunities and the IPTO Solicitation web page for possible new Focal Challenges and other modifications.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) in response to this Focal Challenge must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 noon (ET) Thursday, December 19, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-21 will remain open until 12:00 noon (ET) Friday, June 6, 2003.  Thus, proposals for this Focal Challenge may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA amendment through Friday, June 6, 2003. While the proposals submitted after the Thursday, December 19, 2002, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is significantly less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule for this Focal Challenge.

<DESC>The above referenced BAA is modified to include a new Focal Challenge: Cognitive Systems Evaluation, (CSE) to plan, design, administer, and analyze structured evaluations of cognitive systems.  During the life of this BAA, other Focal Challenges may be introduced. The Cognitive Systems Evaluation Focal Challenge is an addition to the areas of interest described in the basic BAA and subsequent modifications. The intent of this Focal Challenge is to drive the creation of a new capability to evaluate cognitive systems.  The objective of this effort is to provide independent evaluations of cognitive system prototypes and related R&D performed for DARPA/IPTO.  In general, the purpose of these evaluations is to provide the necessary empirical evidence that research progress is being made toward the specific objectives of each relevant IPTO program.  Please refer to the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), particularly the final section, Cognitive Systems Evaluation Addendum for further details on the description, scope, tasks, and deliverables for this effort.   
SCOPE AND TASKS OF THE COGNITIVE SYSTEMS EVALUATION FOCAL CHALLENGE.  The offeror will plan, design, and administer experiments as well as analyze the collected data for each evaluation.  The evaluation offeror will assess all aspects of the cognitive systems under development, including but not limited to reasoning, perception, learning, advice taking, explanation, adaptation to new situations and intelligent responses and other program specific aspects.  Together with the various IPTO development contractors, the evaluation offeror will develop appropriate specifications, evaluation criteria, metrics and tests.  
Tasks for all evaluations: 
Task 1; Design, Specify, and Plan the Annual Evaluation: The offeror will specify the annual evaluations to be conducted for each IPTO R&D program in cognitive systems.  
Task 2; Develop Evaluation Materials and Detailed Planning:  The offeror shall plan, schedule, and develop appropriate evaluation materials for each annual evaluation activity and milestone and provide a more detailed evaluation plan during this task.  
Task 3; Administer Evaluations:  The offeror shall prepare and execute the evaluation as well as perform the preliminary data summarization and validation.  
Task 4; Analyze and Interpret Results:  The offeror will analyze and interpret the results of the evaluations to identify the degree to which each program and technology claim has been substantiated.  
The initial task of this solicited effort will be to provide independent evaluation of the PAL (Perceptive Assistant that Learns) program.  PAL is a long-term DARPA R&D program that focuses on developing an enduring personalized cognitive assistant – a computer system that will learn to adapt to the user instead of the other way around.  SRI International and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) are being funded by DARPA to design and develop prototype cognitive assistants.  SRI’s CALO and CMU’s RADAR efforts, specific descriptions of the CMU and SRI testing efforts, and greater description of the PAL program can be found in the CSE Addendum to the PIP and at http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/open/02-21_Mod6.htm.  
CSE tasks specifically for the PAL program are listed below.  These task descriptions modify or supplement those provided above and do not replace them altogether. 
Task 1: Design, Specify, and Plan the Annual Evaluation: SRI and CMU have  established an evaluation framework and are contracted to administer their own respective evaluations.  The independent evaluator will specify detailed evaluation conditions, evaluation questions and related material within the respective SRI and CMU frameworks. The independent evaluator will develop a refined Evaluation Design, Specification, and Plan jointly with CMU and SRI. 
Task 2: Develop Evaluation Materials and Detailed Planning:  No modification to Task 2 above.  
Task 3: Administer Evaluations:  T

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED SOURCES RELATIVE TO NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE 541512, SIZE STANDARD: $21M. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS. BACKGROUND: NASA, by agreement with the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has operated and managed the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) program since 1976.  The ASRS reporting model has become one of the primary tools recognized as a necessary complement to other safety efforts. NASA has operated and managed the Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) since 1999.  AvSP deals with the operations systems and research concerning aviation safety data.  The ASRS and AvSP requirements are currently combined in NASA contract, NAS2-99091, the Aviation Operations Measuring Systems (AOMS) Contract NAS2-99091, valued at approximately $44M, is currently being performed by Battelle Memorial Institute and will expire on November 8, 2004.	To promote competition, the recompete effort for the AOMS will split the requirement into two procurements.  This sources sought notice is for the AvSP requirement, which will now be addressed as Safety Vulnerability Analysis and Strategic Management (SVASM).  The point of contact for the SVASM requirement is Natalie LeMar, Contract Specialist at Natalie.R.LeMar@nasa.gov.  The Contracting Officer is Jill Willard. A separate sources sought will be posted for the ASRS requirement.  The point of contact for the ASRS is Gail Woll, at Gail.V.Woll@nasa.gov.	Joanne Comstock is the Contracting Officer. REQUIREMENT: NASA/ARC is managing and conducting research and development activities producing technology enabling network-based integration of information sources to allow assessment of National Aviation System (NAS) safety risk.  Under SVASM, the Contractor shall provide development of innovative, advanced tools and methodologies that will for the first time be able to convert digitally recorded or textually reported aviation safety data, distributed across operating organizations and archives into information on the operational performance and safety of the aviation system.	The objective of SVASM is to demonstrate a common working prototype of network-based integration of information extracted from diverse, distributed sources of data.  This prototype will be scalable from integration of data sources within a single operator to NAS-wide operation, and flexible across strategic and tactical timeframes.  The transition from prototype to practice will be one of “opening taps” to current data and scaling computer power to match data volume, as appropriate to the political and proprietary sensitivities of information-sharing among NAS stakeholders.  Development of the prototype will be based upon accessing de-identified copies of databases housed at industry-partners’ facilities.	Sources of information will include: flight-recorded digital data and textual report data from air carriers, radar and datalink data from air traffic facilities, NAS-wide weather information, and other databases (such as the National Aviation Safety Data Analysis Center (NASDAC),  extramural surveys of pilot and controller populations, and other legacy databases) identified through structured user-needs assessment. This will result in a Local Area Network (LAN) of computers in the Contractor’s laboratory, each computer mirroring fully de-identified data held by an operating/monitoring organization, and integrated via “intelligent” middleware.  This local network of computers will constitute a prototype of the capability for automated monitoring for potential safety issues in each database, automated gathering of supporting evidence from other databases, automated multi-database response to safety-oriented queries entered into a browser-based interface, and analysis for causal factors and risk assessment among gathered data. The prototype will include a capability to use non-real-time simulation as appropriate to aid causal analysis for formulating the best interventions and to predict system-wide impacts of proposed changes. Consequently, this requirement is structured into five technical areas.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide resource capacity in manpower and research facilities sufficient to perform activities in each of the following technical areas: 1.  National Safety Data Source Development and Strategic Partnering – The contractor shall cultivate working partnerships for access to data across the U.S. aviation community. Partnerships are considered essential to the development of a workable prototype capability for integrating information extracted from diverse distributed sources for continuous evaluation of system performance and safety. The contractor shall facilitate working partnerships with individual airline companies, the various labor unions, major suppliers, and manufacturers in the aviation industry.  The Contractor shall operate supporting elements, including the Aviation Performance Measuring System (APMS;   http://avsp.larc.nasa.gov/new_asmm.html  ; which has developed networking and tools for radar data). The contractor shall conduct other research under the expressed requirements of these components within the context of SVASM.	The contractor shall provide and maintain systems and tools for test and evaluation at partner facilities, and develop and advance these systems through implementation of tools developed in other elements. NOTE: The contractor’s experience and associations should not be such as might be perceived by members of the aviation community as constituting a potential conflict of interest. 2.     Vulnerability Discovery from Distributed Safety Databases – The contractor shall develop automated tools to monitor each database for potential safety issues and automated tools to analyze disparate data drawn from multiple sources, enhancing discovery, identification, and evaluation of safety risks. Research with each data source will further the science of flight, radar, survey, and textual report data to facilitate vulnerability detection. Research across data sources will advance the ability to draw conclusions about causal relationships among phenomena identified through monitoring or query. 3.  Secure Aviation Network  (SAN) – The contractor shall develop secure, intelligent networking to support efficient and flexible integration of information extracted from heterogeneous and distributed data resources. Architecture will be scalable to operational implementation for a system-wide application or for application within an air carrier or air traffic control system. 4.     Intelligent Middleware for Automated Vulnerability Analysis and Management – The contractor shall develop sophisticated advanced software (middleware) capable of automated gathering of supporting evidence from other databases of issues identified in any given database, and automated analysis in response to safety-oriented queries entered into a browser-based interface. Middleware will enable the cross-data source functions developed in the Vulnerability Discovery element. 5. Technical Integration – The contractor shall coordinate performance of teams accomplishing the four elements above, to ensure timely development of core products enabling prototype development and testing. Due to the need for collaboration and utilization of the prototype lab between the Contractor and the Government technical personnel, the Contractor’s facility will have to be proximate to NASA ARC (within 30 minutes). Additional Information Information on the Aviation Safety and Security Program is available at   http://avsp.larc.nasa.gov/	NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) contemplates a performance based cost-reimbursement incentive type contract with a basic period of performance for two years and three one-year options.  Requirements will be requested via Contract Task Orders (CTOs) against the basic contract. Interested sources should provide their capabilities and qualifications to perform the above requirement, in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time, December 1, 2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement under Full and Open Competition Procedures.   Interested Offerors having the required specialized capabilities/qualifications to meet or exceed the requirement are asked to submit a capability/qualification statement of 15 PAGES or less. Your response should include the following: 1) Company name, address, point of contact, phone, fax, e-mail, and website (if applicable) 2) Size of business, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, HUB Zone, 8(a), or woman-owned for NAISC code 541512, size standard $21M 3) Company capability in the five (5) technical areas: a. National Safety Data Source Development and Strategic Partnering, b. Vulnerability Discovery from Distributed Safety Databases, c. Secure Aviation Network  (SAN), d. Intelligent Middleware for Automated Vulnerability Analysis and Management, and e. Technical Integration.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Communications at Speed & Depth (Comms@S&D)
<SOLNBR>SPAWAR_Headquarters_MKTSVY_2046E
<RESPDATE>121903
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Mark D Lopez, Contract Specialist, 619-524-7168
<DESC>1.0  Description 1.1   The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is seeking sources for the potential development of a Communications at Speed & Depth (Comms@S&D) capability for U.S. Navy submarines. This capability will provide two-way networked communications with submarines while they are submerged at normal operating depths and traveling at speeds required to perform tactical operations. Comms@S&D extends the FORCEnet construct to stealthy undersea Navy platforms with the purpose of increasing the effectiveness of these platforms in achieving the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) SEAPOWER 21 vision. 1.2   Interested parties are requested to provide a written response to this RFI.  Parties may include industry, Government laboratories, federally-funded laboratories and  academic institutions. 1.3   THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this potential requirement. 2.0   Background 2.1   The U.S. Navy is seeking to implement a two-way communications capability for submerged submarines and other undersea platforms that is technically and operationally suitable for 21st Century operations employing Network Centric Warfare, Joint Task Forces, and Allied-partner forces. 2.2   Carrier Strike Group (CSG), Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) and Joint Commanders require rapid Command and Control (C2) communications for assigned forces that operate in the undersea domain.   U.S. Navy Fast Attack Submarines (SSN), Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN), Guided Missile Submarines (SSGN) and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUV) require rapid secure communications with acceptable throughputs between all levels of command while operating at tactical speeds and depths.  Undersea forces? primary C4 systems must support integrated global communications for data exchange with tactical and operational commanders.   The communications systems must be seamless in connectivity, scaleable in capacity, flexible in configuration, and capable of accepting technology insertion and value-added services in support of future defense requirements. 2.3   While operating in a submerged tactical stealth profile, submarines need to be able to transmit and receive voice and digital data immediately between Strike Group Commanders, Joint Force Commanders, and coalition forces. A combination of communications capabilities is needed to achieve this level of connectivity due to different geographic locations, operational security requirements, and infrastructure availability. In some locations and operations, only a satellite communications infrastructure is available; in other situations, a Line of Sight (LOS) communications capability is available due to the availability of aircraft or a close proximity to the shore or surface platforms. Regardless of the mode utilized, the digital data communications capability must be compatible with an IP-based architecture consistent with existing military satellite constellations and compatible with the Navy?s Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) architecture 2.4   It is anticipated that no single solution will provide the Comms@S&D capability on all platforms, in all locations, and for all operations. Rather, a family of solutions may be utilized to maximize the ?speed to market? insertion of new capabilities to the Fleet while minimizing overall cost. It is hoped that an initial capability can be fielded as early as 2007, significant additional capabilities can be fielded by 2012, and the envisioned capabilities can be achieved by 2015. 2.5   Available ?real estate? on SSN platforms (LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, and VIRGINIA Classes) is limited.  Proposed solutions need to address the limitations in volume and weight that are imposed upon hardware installed on these submarines. However, the SSGN platforms provide significant volume and weight capabilities for a payload. 2.6   All candidates will be evaluated to determine their potential impact upon the submarine hulls. The majority of the Comms@S&D installations will be backfits on existing platforms. Any need to penetrate the submarine hull or make significant hull modifications on existing platforms will impose high costs. 3.0   Requested Information 3.1   For respondents providing information regarding complete end-to-end Comms@S&D system concepts, these are the goals to be addressed in the white paper: 1.    Data Rate, Speed, Depth, and Latency a.    Less than 2.4 kbps: Available at all submarine depths and speeds. Ideally, this capability would be available continuously. If it is not, then the total latency required to reliably transfer data should be less than two minutes. b.    2.4 to 9.6 kbps: Available at all submarine depths and speeds up to 15 knots. If this capability is not available continuously, then the latency to establish a reliable link and transfer data should be less than five minutes. c.    9.6 to 128 kbps: Available at submarine depths of at least 300 feet and at speeds up to 8 knots. Intermittent operation is acceptable at this data rate, but with a latency of less than two hours. d.    Greater than 128 kbps: No requirement has been identified for two-way Comms@S&D at these data rates. However, this capability would be desirable if the above requirements are also achieved. 2.    Communications Modes: There are no specific requirements regarding the mode of communications to be used (e.g., RF Line of Sight (LOS), satellite communications, aircraft-based communications, acoustic, or optical.) The communications link may be asymmetrical, using two different modes, frequency bands, data rates, etc., for receive and transmit. If the selected mode requires the deployment of a new infrastructure that is not likely to be available in the corresponding time frame based upon known DoD and commercial plans (e.g., satellite-based blue-green lasers), this fact will be considered as a cost or risk issue. 3.    Deployment Methods: If hardware must be deployed to utilize the capability (e.g., towed, tethered, or launched), then the impact to the submarine?s maneuverability, mission, and vulnerability must be minimal. An attachment to this document provides additional information regarding the configuration of submarine sails and hulls. This data is provided for information only and is not to be considered by the respondent as a specification or definition of a preferred solution. 4.    Stealth a.    Mechanical: The installation of this system on the submarine should not impact its stealth characteristics. The deployment of this system, if required, should have a minimal impact upon the stealth characteristics of the platform. If the impact regarding stealth is significant, then the operations in which this capability can be utilized will be limited. b.    Communications: The compromise to the platform?s vulnerability while transmitting energy should be minimal. It is also essential that data transmission security requirements are met, but it is anticipated that conventional crypto techniques and equipment will be used to achieve this capability. 5.    Environmental Conditions: The Comms@S&D capability will be used in both littoral and ?blue water? environments at many geographical locations. The system should be able to maintain a high level of availability, reliability, and survivability within the impacts of typical weather patterns, sea states, fishing and surface craft densities, noise, pollution, and other environmental variables. 6.    Network Capability: The Comms@S&D capability is envisioned to be inherently ?network-centric? rather than ?point-to-point.? If the communications mode of the candidate utilizes an infrastructure that is not currently planned for implementation by the DoD or industry, then the integration of the proposed infrastructure into the FORCEnet architecture should be addressed in the white paper. 7.    Undersea Communications with Non-Submarine Undersea Platforms and Off-board Sensors: Although this RFI specifically addresses submarine communications at speed and depth, the U.S. Navy is also interested in capabilities for communications with UUVs, undersea sensors, and other undersea devices. Specific requirements for this capability have not yet been defined. Respondents who choose to provide information regarding this capability may do so as an extension of their submarine Comms@S&D white paper or as a separate white paper. 3.2   Respondents who are providing information regarding a specific concept, technology development, or subsystem applicable to the end-to-end Comms@S&D capability should provide a subset of the information requested in paragraph 3.1 as is appropriate.  However, to improve the Navy?s understanding of the potential capability, it is recommended that the respondent describe the potential impact of the technology or concept when integrated into a complete Comms@S&D capability. 4.0   Responses 4.1   Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper. 4.2   White papers in Microsoft Office 2000 compatible or Adobe PDF format are due no later than 15 December 2003.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail only to mark.lopez@navy.mil.  Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and must be clearly marked.  To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information.  Please be advised that all submissions become government property.  If any respondent does not currently have a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that would permit the SPAWAR support contractors listed in Section 4.3 of this RFI to review and evaluate white papers submitted in response to this RFI, the respondent is requested to sign NDAs with these SPAWAR support contractors for this purpose. 4.3   Section One of the white paper shall provide administrative information and shall include as a minimum the name, phone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the designated point of contact. All industry respondents should indicate their company small business status and the extent for which they can include SB, SDB, or 8(a) participation in any potential resulting procurement. Industry respondents should include a statement that the respondent has a signed NDA with the following SPAWAR support contractors that would permit these contractors to review and evaluate white papers submitted in response to this RFI:  Anteon and Booz Allen Hamilton.  If no such NDA exists, respondents should execute an NDA with the aforementioned contractors supporting SPAWAR in technical evaluations. 4.4   Section Two of the white paper shall address the respondent?s technical concept (or concepts) that address the requirements described in section 3.1. Multiple solutions can be addressed by a single respondent in either a single white paper or multiple white papers. However, the combining of multiple technology concepts into an integrated system solution that meets the requirements of section 3.1 is encouraged.  To increase the Navy?s understanding of the value of the capability, the respondent is encouraged to provide a description of the potential Concept of Operations for the system in fictional geographic locations (to prevent the inadvertent classification of the white paper.) A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate may be included to assist the Navy in performing an independent cost estimate for the production, installation, and use of the required system. 4.5   Section Three of the white paper shall address the maturity of the technology and provide a ?road ahead? to the development of the capability described in section 3.1. The maturity of the technology shall be described using the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) metrics defined in DoD 5000 2-R, accompanied with supporting comments or data. An outline of the development efforts and timeline required to achieve TRL 6 (?prototype demonstration in a relevant environment?) should be included. A ROM cost estimate may be included to assist the Navy in performing an independent cost estimate for the technology development prior to Milestone B of an acquisition program. 4.6   Section Four of the white paper shall describe the experience and capabilities of the respondent (or partnership of respondents.)

<SUBJECT>A -- Facilitate the fabrication of Nanoparticles/Biomaterials with in the NCI Nanotechnology Program
<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO PROCURE SERVICES TO FACILITATE THE FABRICATION OF NANOPARTICLES/BIOMATERIALS WITH IN THE NCI NANOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAM ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS TO OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY

The requirement is to acquire the services a contractor to provide personnel to facilitate the fabrication of nanoparticles/biomaterials.  The NCI is developing a technologies program focused nanotechnology approaches to creating new diagnostic, prevention, and treatment modalities.  Nanotechnology has the promise to provide new strategies for cancer detection and intervention at its most fundamental levels and at the earliest possible time.

The NCI nanotechnology program is establishing a new pipeline beginning with the design and fabrication of new materials through their evaluation in the laboratory to their deployment in clinical setting.  To facilitate intramural investigations in demonstration projects, the NCI is seeking to contract with a nanofabrication facility to produce high quality biomaterials for engagement in focused cancer research.  Since NCI does not have a fabrication facility on campus or at its immediate disposal, they plan to acquire services that will enable custom fabrication of detection and delivery materials through a contract mechanism.  

To support this effort, staffing is necessary with a high degree of technical expertise and skills in biomaterials and fabrication techniques.  The contractor will provide design and engineering of biomaterials for the purposes of NCI sponsored intramural investigations.   The contractor will also provide the basis of training of NCI staff and contractors in fabrication skills, applications, principles of biomaterials, and provide additional context to overcoming barriers between the engineering and biological sciences.  

The contract with the host institution will provide support at the equivalent of two (2) full-time positions with the following background:

1)	Ph.D. in engineering, bioengineering, or materials sciences
2)	A minimum of 2 years post-graduate experience in applied graduate research in nanotechnology
3)	Skills, abilities, and talents to support independent fabrication of micro- and nano-materials, derived from silicon, metal-based, and viral or biological vectors. 
4)	Familiar with quality control, quality assurance procedures for production of nanoparticles
5)	Practices high level of safety in handling biological materials
6)	Familiar with principles of cancer detection and drug delivery systems
7)	Knowledge and expertise about the interactions of materials and biological systems (cells, DNA, protein, etc.). 

The contract will involve some travel (approximately 4 times a year) to Bethesda or Frederick, MD.  Each position will be required to be based full-time at the location of a fabrication facility that is contracted to the NCI or SAIC.  

The work conducted under this agreement precludes manufacturing of materials for the contractor’s own use, commercialization by fabrication facility or to be provided to another or third party contractor.

The period of the contract is for one (1) year with an option to renew a second year.
