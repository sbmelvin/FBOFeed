<SUBJECT>FPS3 - Force Protection Site Security Systems
<SOLNBR>FA8730-14-R-0004
<CONTACT>Elizabeth Baker, Contracting Officer, Phone 781-255-5514, Email elizabeth.baker@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC><p>1. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center - Force Protection Division intends to solicit a five-year multiple-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Force Protection Site Security Systems (FPS3) contract.</p>
<p>2. The Force Protection Site Security Systems (FPS3) contract provides for acquisition, upgrade and sustainment of a family of Integrated Base Defense Security Systems (IBDSS) including:</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed site Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)<br />&bull; Tactical security systems such as the Tactical Automated Security Systems (TASS)<br />&bull; Delay/denial systems such as the Remote Target Engagement System (RTES)</p>
<p>These systems provide electronic capabilities to support and enhance security and assist Security Forces (SF) in protecting assets and personnel at nuclear and non-nuclear fixed and tactical sites around the world. Their goal is to provide SF with the capability to "See First, Understand First, and Act First."</p>
<p>Fixed site IDS projects are driven by unit requirements and are tailored to fit the Protection Level (PL) requirements of assigned resources at each site where they are installed. These projects may be as simple as purchasing equipment to satisfy a user's needs or as complex as providing for design, installation, test, and sustainment of a system of hardware and software to protect an entire base. They provide an electronic means to accomplish area intrusion detection, alarm reporting and display, remote alarm assessment, and alert SF to intrusions to enhance resource and facility protection. Fixed-Site systems are delivered as permanent security systems to protect high priority assets, with a focus on PL 1 (nuclear and non-nuclear), 2, 3, and 4 resources such as aircraft, munitions, command and control centers, etc.</p>
<p>The FPS3 contract provides for acquisition, upgrade and sustainment of tactical security systems such as TASS, a rapidly deployable, re-locatable and integrated security system designed as a "first-in" capability for a variety of force protection missions. TASS has been fielded and is currently sustained at forward-operating locations worldwide.</p>
<p>The FPS3 contract will also provide for acquisition, upgrade and sustainment of delay/denial systems such RTES, which provide final access denial to high-value assets at specified nuclear systems locations.</p>
<p>3. The contract is intended to allow for set-aside for small business on individual delivery orders. The Government intends to award two (2), or more or less, contracts to small business concerns and three (3), or more or less, contracts to other than small business concerns. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561621, with a size standard of $19M.</p>
<p>4. Military sensitive technologies and export controlled data inherent to the execution of the FPS3 IDIQ cannot and will not be made available to foreign companies or countries. The Foreign Disclosure Office has determined that foreign participation will not be permitted for the FPS3 effort.</p>
<p>5. The Government anticipates final RFP release on or about 5 Dec 13, proposals due on or about 17 Jan 14, and contract award between Aug 14 and Oct 14.</p>
<p>6. Please address all questions exclusively to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Brayden Burroughs, (781) 225-1748, e-mail: Brayden.burroughs@hanscom.af.mil and the PCO, Ms. Elizabeth Baker at (781) 225-5514, e-mail: Elizabeth.baker@hanscom.af.mil.</p>
<p>7. This presolicitation notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only the PCO is legally authorized to commit the Government. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the Offeror for costs, if any, associated with this notification.</p>

<DESC>******PLEASE CONTACT MARY BRINKLEY/ARCS ONLY FOR ALL TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OR CONSIDERATION REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. MARY BRINKLEY'S/ARCS CONTACT INFORMATION IS IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION****** NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center has a requirement to upgrade the Robotic Weld Tool (RWT), Parameter Development System (PDS), and the Pull Plug Weld Tool (PPWT) 1 and PPWT 2. NASA/MSFC intends to procure these services from PAR Systems. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1) PAR Systems is the original equipment manufacturer. 2) The original computer code and auxiliary hardware is unique and proprietary to the PAR Systems. 3) Procurement of these services from another source other than PAR Systems would require that the entire operating code for the four weld tools would have to be rewritten per other companies' specifications and any auxiliary hardware such as interfacing cables between the computer and hardware would have to be redesigned and reengineered. That would be cost prohibitive for the government. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Mary.M.Brinkley@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 19, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. The official point of contact is Artra C. House; however, all questions/considerations shall be submitted to Mary Brinkley/ARCS at Mary.M.Brinkley@nasa.gov, or faxed to (256)961-9604.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>

<CONTACT>Angela Lower

<a href="mailto:lower.angela@epa.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD); National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) has a requirement for technical support for the Testing and Evaluation of Homeland Security and All-Hazards Technologies for the Measurement, Sampling, Removal, and Decontamination of Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Agents.  Support shall be provided for research efforts in the detection and decontamination of chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR) contamination that may be intentionally introduced into drinking water distribution systems, ambient (indoor and outdoor) air, buildings and other surfaces. The successful contractor will supply all necessary labor, material, services, equipment, and facilities in support of the effort delineated by the performance work statement.  The anticipated primary purpose of this technical support is to test, evaluate, and report on all-hazards-related science and technology for addressing Chemical, Biological, or Radiological and other contamination agents. The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) require an offeror to certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation.  The Agency has determined that offerors directly engaged in or which have a business or financial relationship(s) with entities that own or market, or has any business or financial relationships with firms, that own or market commercial technologies that could be used to monitor, detect, and decontaminate CBR contaminants, may have significant potential organizational conflicts of interest in relation to the requirements of this solicitation. In addition, a potential organizational conflict of interest may exist with offerors that provide consulting and/or technical services related to these activities. The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contract or to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the resultant solicitation.  The Government anticipates awarding the new contract as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) multiple award type contract with firm fixed price and cost plus fixed fee task orders over a five year ordering period. The EPA intends to award up to three (3) contracts using full and open competition.  The anticipated minimum amount is $100,000 and the anticipated maximum is $20 million.  The applicable NAICS code is 541712 (Research & Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences) with a size standard of 500 employees.  The solicitation is expected to be issued in December 2013 on EPA?s website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. The office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which may be considered by the agency.  The point of contact is Angela Lower at 513-487-2036, at lower.angela@ep a.gov.

<a href="mailto:sstuart1@osmre.gov">sstuart1@osmre.gov</a>
<DESC>The Office of Surface Mining (OSM), Western Regional Coordinating Center, is planning to procure Geotechnical Architecture and Engineering Services in support of the Abandoned Mine Land Program (AML). The services are related to:  (1) site investigations, (2) surveys and development of site maps, (3) development of reclamation design alternatives, (4) identification of environmental effects of proposed construction, (5) preparation of construction specifications and plans, (6) construction cost estimating, (7) monitoring of construction activities, (8) sampling of mine gases and mine drainage, and (9) technical support and use of an existing project management database and ArcGIS mapping system.
All work is directly related to hazards associated with abandoned coal mines.  Hazards at abandoned coal mine sites primarily consist of open shafts and portals, mine subsidence, venting mine gases, and mine drainage.  Most of the sites are located in Washington, and occasionally in the OSM Western Region states of California and Oregon.  Geographic proximity to the Washington project sites is a major consideration in the selection process.  Project sites are determined when the AML projects are identified by the OSM.  The government anticipates awarding one indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract.  The term of the contract shall be one year with four one-year options beginning April 1, 2014.  Exercise of yearly options is at the discretion of the government and subject to the availability of funds.  OSM guarantees a minimum work amount of $25,000 per year.  
The following criteria will be used to evaluate prospective firms and their project teams (including all sub-consultants).  Criteria 1 through 4 are of equal weight, and contribute to a higher portion of the Firms overall ranking.  Criteria 5 is of lesser weight.
1. Specific individual experience and professional qualifications of personnel assigned to the project team, as necessary for performance of required services. 2. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required. 3. Organization and management of the project team and the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. 4. Location of the project team. 5. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.
Architecture and Engineering Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit three copies of completed Standard Form 330  Architecture-Engineering Qualifications, to the office above.  Respondents are encouraged to limit their Standard Form 330 submittal to no more than 50 pages.  Respondents may supplement their submittal with no more than two examples of relevant work (3 copies) prepared by the proposed team.  Firms responding to this announcement by December 2, 2013 will be considered.  This is not a Request for Proposal.

<DESC>The Department of Justice is seeking attorneys to litigate debt collection cases for various Federal agencies. Using negotiated procedures authorized in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, the Department of Justice (DOJ) contemplates award of up to five contracts with private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the counties that comprise the Federal Judicial District for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The DOJ launched the Private Counsel Program following the passage of the Federal Debt Recovery Act of 1986 which first authorized the use of private law firms for this purpose. The Debt Collection Management Staff manages the program with legal oversight by the United States Attorney's Offices at the district level. The program is currently running in 19 districts nationwide, with further expansion planned. This procurement is strictly limited to attorneys who are licensed to practice law in the Western District of Pennsylvania. Contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); and to input relevant case data in a computer database maintained by the Government. Contract payments will primarily consist of contingency fees earned for unsecured debt collections, fixed fees earned for foreclosures and bankruptcies, and hourly rates for performing miscellaneous ancillary litigation. The anticipated period of performance for each contract will be a base year with up to four option years. The solicitation will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fbo.gov, and is anticipated to be released on or about December 19, 2013. Amendments to the solicitation, if any, issued prior to the receipt of proposals will also be posted on www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site for access to the solicitation. All responsible sources meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. It is recommended that, prior to submitting a proposal, interested parties obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and register in the System for Award Management (SAM), www.sam.gov, as these requirements are mandatory for any firm selected for a contract award.

A Government Technical Data Package (TDP) will also be available for informational purposes once the draft RFP has been released.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY <br>  <br> This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a solicitation is released. The requested information is for market research and planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. <br>  <br> GENERAL INFORMATION <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Theater Contracting Command (TCC) at U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz, Kaiserslautern, Germany, is planning to contract with firms to perform performance-based environmental services to address compliance-cleanup needs at Army Garrisons within the U.S. Army Europe footprint (includes Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands) in accordance with technical and regulatory requirements. <br>  <br> TCC anticipates the award of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to multiple firms under a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) pricing arrangements in each contract. Additionally, we currently anticipate that each contract will have a 5-year basic ordering period with performance. <br>  <br> PROJECT NARRATIVE <br>  <br> The Army is considering a performance-based approach involving remedial investigation and remedial action efforts at U.S. Army Europe Garrisons.  The contract will emphasize results in terms of environmental clean-up for individual sites, groups of sites or an entire installation (fence-to-fence). The approach looks for technically and cost-effective methods for achieving clean-up by focusing on achievement of desired objectives without specifying the processes or technologies for obtaining those objectives. The performance-based initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of site closures (SC) or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner.  It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced.  If site closure with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline an optimized exit strategy that will be implemented to accomplish SC.  The awarded contractor shall perform all necessary environmental, construction and engineering activities as required to meet the performance objectives of the Performance Work Statements (PWS). <br>  <br> Interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability outlining past work that is related to this requirement as stated above. The company's standard format is acceptable; however, the limit for all responses is not to exceed fifteen (15) pages. The statement of capability shall include: <br>  <br> I. Contractor Name <br> a. Address <br> b. Point of Contact (POC) <br> c. POC phone number(s) and e-mail addresses <br> d. Cage code <br>  <br> II. Description of Relevant Contract Experience (Government and Commercial) <br> a. Contract number <br> b. Description of the requirement <br> c. Place of performance <br> d. POC for the requiring activity <br> e. POC address, e-mail phone number(s), fax number and the company's web page, if applicable <br>  <br> Interested parties are also requested to provide responses to questions in Attachment 1. There is no page limitation for responses to Attachment 1. <br>  <br> Since this is an RFI to be used in market research and planning a possible future acquisition, please do not send in any proposals. Request for proposals, if or when issued, will be available on the Internet at FedBizOpps via Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). As such, it is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any additional information. <br>  <br> Please submit your comments before 1600 Central European Time, 29 November 2013. All information provided will become the property of the United States Army and will be kept as confidential information. Please note that official information will be provided only by the Contracting Officer. Any information received from other sources should not be relied upon as official. <br>  <br> Interested parties should submit statement of capability and responses to Attachment 1 via e-mail to stephanie.m.vandine.civ@mail.mil and william.d.mills.civ@mail.mil. Electronic submission is required.

The incumbent contractor currently provides a staff of 63-81 Software Developers. <br />Developed, managed and supported by NIH's Office of Extramural Research, the eRA systems, provide information technology solutions and support for the full life cycle of grants administration functions for the NIH as well as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). eRA is a mission critical, complex custom grants management solution for the federal government.<br />eRA and its systems manage the receipt, processing, review, award and monitoring of over $30 billion in research and non-research grants awarded annually by NIH and other grantor agencies. eRA systems are used by Federal staff and applicants at over 11,000 institutions worldwide to: <br />&bull; Record, review and process over 80,000 applications each year.<br />&bull; Maintain and support more than 200,000 active grants. <br />&bull; Support nearly 27,000 reviewers and more than 3,500 review meetings held annually. <br />&bull; Administer more than 55,000 awarded competing and non-competing grants.<br />&bull; Maintain patent and invention records for 25 Federal agencies. <br />&bull; Support thousands of applicant interactions with the Federal Government before and after the grant award, through the eRA Commons. <br />eRA systems align with Grants.gov (the one-stop web portal for finding and applying for federal grants), allowing for full electronic processing of grant applications from application submission through closeout of the grant award. eRA systems provide a suite of 125 modules supporting end-to-end grants administration. The entire eRA Enterprise with all of its intra-dependent systems shares a common data model, residing within an Oracle database platform. The hardware architecture is primarily Unix servers with some special purpose Windows server machines. The application architecture is a web enabled multi-tier J2EE environment. The development activities in the eRA program follow the eRA Software Development Life Cycle methodology which is based on the Department of Health and Human Services Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC). The majority of work to be performed by this acquisition consists of supporting existing code, and minimal, if any, new development will be performed under this contract.</p>

<p>Federal grants management system experience as a prime contractor similar in size, scope and complexity to the eRA program is an absolute requirement and a key success indicator. The goal of this procurement is two-fold: (1) to provide a practical solution for eRA software development support services for eRA in all program areas (application design, development and maintenance; new initiatives; and integration of HHS and other agencies) into one contract, and (2) to meet the needs of the end user community and their expectations for service. The preponderant amount of the work is increasingly maintenance and enhancements of existing systems, and new functionality that spans across multiple systems; therefore, the eRA strategy for accomplishing these goals has been to restructure from individual project teams to a customer focused service team approach.</p>
<p>Below are the characteristics of the eRA software development requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Project Planning Support<br />&bull; Requirements Development Support<br />&bull; Application Design<br />&bull; Implementation (coding/new development and maintenance)<br />&bull; System and Integration Testing Support<br />&bull; Project Integration Management/Development Support<br />&bull; IT Security<br />&bull; Application Architecture Support<br />&bull; Production Support<br />&bull; Documentation Support<br />&bull; Training Support<br />&bull; eRA Infrastructure Support</p>

<SOLNBR>SOL-R3-13-00006
<RESPDATE>092713
<ARCHDATE>10272013
<CONTACT>James M. Clark
<DESC>National Remedial Action Contracts / Multiple Award Competitions   (RAC / MAC)    52.215-3  Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although ?proposal? and ?offeror? are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of seeking sources and information for market research as more fully described below. 
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (SS/RFI) announcement published for market research purposes.    THIS IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SS/RFI.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND/OR ANY FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS.  No communications that request additional information or a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. EPA is implementing a Remedial Action Framework for the next round of Response Action Contracts.  This strategic sourcing is endorsed by the Administrator of EPA and works toward the President?s mandate on more effective contracting. There will be Full and Open National Multiple Award Contracts.  Additionally each Region plans to have at least one small business RAC.  EPA is performing market research to determine if industry has the capability and capacity to perform the work, on a national level, as described in the attached draft Statement of Work /Performance Work Statement(SOW/PWS).  EPA is also seeking input from industry on several questions and issues to help develop and structure the resulting contracts, including the SOW/PWS. 
A request for SF330s, Architect Engineer Qualifications,  will be issued at a later date.  EPA intends to award multiple contracts ( as few as two(2), or possibly four (4) or more based upon market research and the needs of the agency.  These will be multiple award, task order contracts.   EPA anticipates that the multiple contracts will be awarded using a variety of pricing methodologies including firm-fixed price, cost reimbursement, etc.    EPA further anticipates that the awards will be made in Fiscal Year 2014.   The NAICS code is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services. EPA desires that these contracts include performance of all tasks related to the entire Superfund remedial pipeline from site assessment through construction and operation of remedies (that is, to be ?full service.?)  The purpose of these contracts will be to provide national support to EPA and its responsibilities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA): the Superfund Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA); and the Robert T. Stafford Natural Disaster Act pursuant to the Federal Response Plan (FRP) and other laws to help address and/or mitigate endangerment to public health, welfare or the environment during emergencies and natural disasters; and to support States, tribal governments, local governments, and communities in preparing for and responding to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants.  These contracts may also be used to support other EPA program s and federal agencies requiring similar services.  The Region intends to set aside Regional RACs for small business only.
Contracts will be awarded pursuant to the Brooks Act procedures of FAR Subpart 36.6, as Remedial Action Contracts, Multiple Award Competitions (RAC MAC) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contracts.  Resulting Contracts could cover up to a 10 year term, including options, and would cover a significant part of the $500,000,000 annual Superfund remedial budget.  Given the uncertain fiscal climate, this estimate may decrease. After award, each Task Order will be subject to a competition process as defined in the RFP and award.   The purpose of this SS/RFI is to: 1) identify potential  large and small sized businesses  sources that can  meet the Government?s requirement; 2) obtain suggestions on variable pricing schemes based on regional variations in labor rates, goods and materials, etc., for the requirement on a National level* :  3) to improve the content of the SOW/PWS ; and 4) to obtain information from the marketplace concerning any other areas that may assist the EPA in structuring this RAC MAC for maximum effectiveness and efficiency in performing the required tasks.  The successful contractors should be able to provide all necessary personnel, materials, equipment, and services in support of the performance requirements, objectives and standards delineated in the SOW/PWS on a national level.  Contractors should have experience in the services listed.  A draft SOW/PWS  is attached for information purposes only; this document is not in final form and is subject to change.  ANY INTERESTED FIRM should provide point of contact information (name, title, telephone number, and email address) where available for the efforts cited above.   Interested firms are requested to reply in ?MS Word? format.  Interested firms are specifically requested to organize their responses in accordance with the numerical format and content provided below.  1.	Provide recommendations or strategies for National pricing strategies to include possibilities such as pricing schemes, potential zone pricing, single price fully loaded labor rates and the advantages and disadvantages of each.  If possible, provide actual contract samples  that have pricing arrangements for a National level contract. 2.	Provide recommendations/experience on tasks and efforts for fixed price contracting 3.	Review the draft SOW/PWS  and make any suggestions or recommendations for improvement.  Please identify areas that are not fully addressed or lack clarity. 4.	Describe any Environmentally Preferred Practices that your firm would utilize in performance of the attached SOW/PWS.  5.	Provide recommendations and list experience in the process to compete requirements. 6.	Identify all available locations that your firm would use to support work, considering that any resultant task orders could be issued simultaneously for work in different regions. 7.	 Does your firm have the necessary skills mix and experience required for a national contract? 8.	What would you identify as the benefits or potential risks of a RAC contract that covers the entire  country? 9.	List any recommendations for what is needed to make RAC MAC successful. 10.	Provide recommended performance measures and provide examples from your current contracts. 11.	How would you streamline the current RACs reports of work(e.g. Invoice, Progress Report, etc.) 12.	Describe your companies? ability to obtain the necessary subcontracts to support this national effort. 13.

<DESC>The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) is an independent Federal government agency with responsibility for the oversight of the Department of Energy (DOE)'s defense nuclear facilities located throughout the United States.  The Board is directed by a Chairman and four members appointed by the President.  The Board's mission as described by the Atomic Energy Act is to ensure that the public health and safety are adequately protected at the DOE defense nuclear facilities.  More specifically, the Board conducts oversight of DOE nuclear weapon operations, nuclear material processing and stabilization, nuclear facilities design and infrastructure (both new facilities and modifications to existing facilities), and nuclear safety programs.  In fulfilling this mission, the Board periodically contracts for "outside professional experts" on an as needed basis to provide high level technical expertise in a number of different areas.  The Board has an emerging need for proven experts with the following professional qualifications: 1) Demonstrated experience in nuclear probabilistic risk assessment (PRA); 2) Extensive technical expertise and knowledge of PRA methodology and related data analysis techniques; 3) Practical experience of PRA applications, along with an understanding of the model attributes necessary for the sound and defensible use of PRA in a variety of applications, 4) The ability to assume a leadership role in multi-disciplinary PRA teams and assist career staff in accomplishing reviews and building capabilities in PRA; 5) Master's or Doctoral Degree  in nuclear engineering or related field with 10 years of experience directly related to the  probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) of nuclear safety applications; 6) Active DOE Q Security Clearance is preferred.
<p>The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential sources capable of providing such expertise in any of the above areas.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation notice for proposals and the Board reserves the right not to issue a solicitation or award a contract as a result of this notice; thus FIRMS SHOULD NOT RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE BY REQUESTING TO BE PLACED ON A SOLICITATION MAILING LIST.  In addition, due to its oversight role over DOE, the Board's conflict of interest (COI) policy precludes awards to firms (or their affiliates) with existing contracts or subcontracts that support DOE; thus such sources need not respond to this notice (sources with a potential COI must fully disclose the COI and any proposed mitigation in any response).  Interested sources should respond to this notice by providing a brief (not to exceed three (3) pages) overview of the company along with resumes of their "experts".  Resumes are not included in the 3 page limit but shall not exceed three (3) pages each (sources who work as individual consultants need not provide a company overview and may provide a resume only).  In addition, the submitted information for all sources shall include three references of related work currently being performed or completed within the last two (2) years (not to exceed a total of one (1) page per reference).  Each reference shall include the Government agency or business to whom services are provided, the contract/project period of performance, the name and phone number of the customer project officer, contract number and dollar value, and a brief description of the services provided.</p>
<p>The requested information shall be submitted via electronic mail to vij@dnfsb.gov by 4:00 p.m. on December 13, 2013.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice and respondents will not be notified of the results of the Board's review of the submitted information.</p>

<DESC>SOURCEES SOUGHT TO OBTAIN COMMENTS FROM INDUSTRY PERTAINING TO A DRAFT SOLICITATION - ACTUARIAL SERVICES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) 
BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC), is seeking meaningful comments and feedback from interested stakeholders on the attached draft Solicitation document.  The process of issuance of this draft Solicitation by VA and the subsequent submission of feedback/comments from industry is considered an exchange of information before receipt of proposals (FAR 15.201).  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality supplies and services, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.
DISCLAIMER: This DRAFT Solicitation is issued solely for information and planning purposes ONLY and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotes (RFQ), an Invitation for Bids (IFB), or any other solicitation vehicle.  All information received in response to this DRAFT Solicitation that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this DRAFT Solicitation.  The Government will consider all comments and feedback in the preparation of the final RFP, however, will not respond to any direct questions.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  In October 1996, Congress enacted the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-262.  Eligibility Reform transformed the VA health care system from an episodic, inpatient care provider into a comprehensive health care provider and expanded eligibility for health care to all Veterans.  To manage resources, the law required VA to implement a priority based enrollment system and to annually assess the resources required to provide care to enrolled Veterans.  In 1998, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning (ADUSH/PP) partnered with an actuarial consulting firm to develop the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to project Veteran demand for VA health care.  Contractor assistance is being sought for health care actuarial consulting, modeling, and analytical services to assess the impact of an evolving VA health care system and environment and proposed policies, regulations, and legislation on Veteran demand for VA health care; support the VA medical care budget process, and support VA leadership and stakeholders including the Office of Management and Budget, Congress, the Government Accountability Office, Congressional Budget Office, and the Veteran Service Organizations, in understanding historical and projected Veteran demand for VA health care.  This will include maintaining, enhancing, and annually updating the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM).  The EHCPM is the tool used to project Veteran enrollment and utilization of VA health care and the associated expenditures under varying scenarios of the future that reflect the dynamic environment in which VA exists.

COMMENT/RESPONSE PROCESS: 
All comments and feedback shall clearly identify and reference the specific line, section, and page of the DRAFT solicitation of which they pertain. In any event that feedback or comments are general in nature, they shall be labeled "general comments" and compiled logically together on a singular and separate document.  
Parties may use the Microsoft "track changes" feature ONLY if inserting "comments" into the margin. DO NOT make deletions, insertions, or move information from one portion of the document to another.

a.	Contractor name, address, and contact information
b.	Business type (small, other than small, non-profit, etc.)

b.	Any specific requirement that would limit ability to compete

d.	Factors the contractor would distinguish their capabilities from competitors.

Submissions after this date may not be reviewed.  The Government will not be responsible for Government receipt of feedback/comments.

Request for Information (3) - November 13, 2013
Questions/Industry Input Needed

This request does not commit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that VA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
Information
The mission of VA, Office of Information & Technology (OIT), Service Delivery and Engineering (SDE) is to direct operational and maintenance activities associated with VA's Information Technology (IT) environment on behalf of the Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology (AS/IT).  In meeting these goals, OIT strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient IT services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all points of the Veterans' health care in an effective, timely and compassionate manner.  VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.  This includes overseeing and managing VA regional data centers, the IT network, and telecommunications; conducting production monitoring for all information systems, production services, managing the delivery of operations services to all VA geographic locations.
Mission
OIT-SDE is responsible for providing LEC services for VA Medical Centers, Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC), field and program offices and other remote users that are geographically dispersed throughout the US and District of Columbia.

This effort will provide a consolidated and centralized approach to acquire and manage these services.  It will also help VA achieve the Federal Government requirements to consolidate the acquisition of services to reduce overall costs.  The proposed project will also allow OIT-SDE Enterprise level to centralize management of LEC services and in turn reduce recurring costs.  
In fiscal year (FY)14 and FY15, VA intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contract which will consolidate the current LEC services contracts.  It is anticipated that this effort will provide significant savings in LEC telecommunication services and improved management of such.   The intent is to execute this with a minimal amount of infrastructure changes and no impact on service.

<CONTACT>Ashley Reichl, Email UCR@netl.doe.gov
<DESC><p>The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory that produces technological solutions to America's energy challenges. For more than 100 years, the laboratory has developed tools and processes to provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy to the American people. Developing the science and technology base to enable the efficient and environmentally sustainable production of domestic shale-gas resources is a top priority in NETL's energy production research. Realizing economical, secure, and abundant fuel supplies must balance with protecting air, land, water resources, and human health. New developments in the energy industry, such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing used for shale gas and oil production, have raised significant public concern over their potential to impact the environment. NETL is actively seeking partnerships with operators to monitor environmental signals in order to develop: (1) independent datasets documenting environmental conditions from pre-development through production to provide the public with an unbiased perspective on the impacts of shale gas development; and (2) the science and technology base for future strategies to ensure that adverse events can be avoided, or where not avoided, detected and appropriately mitigated. NETL's field efforts will be fully funded; there is no cost to operators.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source
<SOLNBR>SOL-DC-14-00001
<ARCHDATE>12252013
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), on behalf of the American Indian Environmental Office (AIEO), intends to negotiate a follow-on extension of services on a labor hour, sole source basis.  A modification to extend support services to Lockheed Martin Management Systems Designers (Lockheed) of 2677 Prosperity Avenue, Suite 700, Fairfax, VA 22031-4906, performed under task order number EP-G12H-00328 and issued against Lockheed's General Services Administration schedule contract number GS-35F-4550G, will be processed under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A) and (C).  The sole source extension is in the interest of economy and efficiency, and the new work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order given that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) ordering procedures. The original order was not previously iss ued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures.  Additionally, an urgent and compelling need exists as following the standard competitive FSS procedures would cause unacceptable delays in the EPA's ability to support the Administrator and the Office of International and Tribal Affairs' priorities aligned with the Agency Strategic Plan: Goal 3 -- Cleaning up Communities and Advancing Sustainable Development; and Objective 4 -- Strengthen Human Health and Environmental Protection in Indian Country.  In addition, the work supports the Agency's Cross-Goal Strategy: "Strengthening State, Tribal, and International Partnerships", facilitating the collection of program performance information nationally to evaluate the impact of tribal capacity development activities.
The referenced contract task order is scheduled to expire on 30 November 2013.  A new contract task order will not be awarded by the expiration date primarily due to delays associated with the federal Government shutdown.  A gap in service is unacceptable to the EPA.  The sole source award will help to continue the ongoing regular operation of the Environmental Data System Support for EPA's AIEO operations and to ensure that costs, resources, and activities are managed appropriately.  In order to avoid a gap in service, EPA intends to award a one (1) month extension of the current contract task order until a competitive contract task order can be awarded by 1 January 2014.
The modification is for non-personal services to be extended on Lockheed's referenced contract task order.  The task order was awarded competitively on 9 February 2012.  The modification to extend services is expected to cost $12,546.00 for the one (1) month performance period.  The level of services provided by Lockheed under this extension are in accordance with the contract task order Statement of Work, but have been reduced from the originally awarded amount.  Under the current task order, Lockheed provides services to AIEO, including database maintenance, operations and maintenance support, limited customer support, and minimal system updates or enhancements.  Lockheed has the experience to address the follow-on requirement from having worked with the General Assistance Program (GAP) online system from its inception to current working state, and a level of familiarity with GAP stakeholders that is needed to keep the program and system running as smoothly as possible.
THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION FOR FOLLOW-ON WORK UNDER THE REFERENCED CONTRACT TASK ORDER.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE/PROPOSAL.  NO SOLICITATION FOR THE ONE (1) MONTH FOLLOW-ON EXTENSION WILL BE PROVIDED.  The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely in the discretion of the EPA.  The EPA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.  This notice in no way obligates the EPA to award the one (1) month follow-on extension of services, sole source modification under the subject contract task order.
Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than 25 November 2013 by 10:00 AM ET to Stefan Martiyan, Contracting Officer, via email at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.  The current Statement of Work for the referenced contract task order is provided at:  http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/pcsc/EDSSAIEO/index.htm.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrate that competition of the one (1) month extension of services would be advantageous to the Government and would not hinder EPA mission objectives.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:  Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Tunis, Tunisia as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Tunisia country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>On January 14, 2011, long-time President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali fled Tunisia after one month of youth-led protests fueled by socioeconomic grievances, corruption, and political repression.  The revolution ushered in a wave of political excitement for Tunisia and prompted the initial steps towards democracy and political reform.  USAID/OTI seeks to support Tunisians in their pursuit of a democratic society and more equitable, responsive, and legitimate governance.  In particular, the program provides material and technical support to communities, civil society organizations, and local institutions to help build democratic resiliency, increase citizen participation in democratic life, and bolster positive change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Middle East (ME), the Country Representative will:<br /> <br />&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS (USAID's Automated Directives System);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Middle East, or his/her designee, as well as to the Tunisia Mission Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Tunisia program, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Tunisia, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout host country, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment #1 is hereby issued to provide the following Questions with their respective Answers, see below. All other terms and conditions will remain the same.</p>
<p>&bull; Seeing as you mention in the statement of work that one or more training sessions may run concurrently, would you allow for an overflow property to accommodate the double increase in lodging needs? No, the property should be able to accommodate the entire number <br /><br />&bull; Next to your period of performance dates that list Plus or minus 45 rooms, page 4 SOW, you also state you need a down time room. Would you please clarify for me exactly what this means? A down time room would be used as a casual meeting space for participants to congregate, and should be large enough to accommodate minimum of 20 people comfortably at one time and segregated from other hotel patrons (a lounge seating area in a lobby would be an unacceptable down room) and should include amenities such as a television and internet/wi-fi access. The number of rooms may vary depending on the number of students and instructors at any particular class not to exceed 45.<br /><br />&bull; Page 5 SOW it states "A conference room must be provided 6:00pm - midnight Feb 4, 2013 through Feb 13, 2013. Would you please provide the correct dates? Feb 4, 2014 through Feb 13, 2014<br /><br />&bull; Pricing Table: Since you want the hotels to accommodate approximately 45 rms per night/per stay, do you only want the Quantity column to reflect the price of one guestroom, or all 45 cumulatively with total cost per day for those 45 rooms? I hope this makes sense. The quantity column should reflect the price of one guestroom per night/per stay.</p>

The second drop off will be scheduled as needed by the Nuclear Medicine technologists.   The PET radiopharmaceuticals need to be contained in a syringe with the patient's name, identifier, description of what was ordered, and dosage amount in order to eliminate possible administration errors. The Contractor must include provision for return of and credit for cancelled doses.

The contractor is also responsible for delivering the materials following the shipping protocol in accordance with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements and the State of New York and Department of Transportation (DOT) rules and regulations.

<CONTACT>Jennifer Van Renterghem, Phone 703-875-4357, Email jvanrenterghem@ustda.gov
<DESC><br />
<p>Please note the following questions have been answered:<br /><br />1. I'm assembling&nbsp;our response to this proposal and am wondering if there is a specific point of contact at Green Cape to whom I should address cover letters etc.?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please address to attention of:</span> <br />Green Cape<br />2nd Floor, 44A Bloem Street<br />Cape Town, South Africa</p>
<p>2. If submitting a proposal as a "U.S. Individual" what form do I fill out?</p>
<p>All U.S. individuals or firms should complete the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">U.S. Firm Form</span>. The form can be downloaded here:<br /><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/program/proposals/docs/USTDA_DueDiligence_USFirmForm.pdf">http://www.ustda.gov/program/proposals/docs/USTDA_DueDiligence_USFirmForm.pdf</a></p>
<p>3. Under the definition of "U.S. Firm," if your firm is more than 50% U.S owned do the conditions listed after (b) apply? I.e. the firm:<br />&bull; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period;<br />&bull; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and <br />&bull; has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question.</p>
<p>The definition of a U.S. Firm is satisfied by either condition (a) or condition (b). This definition and USTDA's National, Source and Origin Requirements can be referenced here:<br /><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/foia/USTDA_NationalityRequirements.pdf">http://www.ustda.gov/foia/USTDA_NationalityRequirements.pdf</a></p>
<p>4. In the budget document, it breaks out Direct Contractor Labor and Local Support Labor Costs. Please verify that the Local Support Labor costs are those of local subcontractors who can make up no more than 20% of the budget and not costs associated with Green Cape's labor to manage and/or support the project.</p>
<p>This is correct. Up to twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount may be used to pay for services performed by (i) Host Country subcontractors, and/or (ii) Host Country nationals who are employees of the Contractor.</p>
<p>5. Multi-part question:<br />a. The Tender defines a US firm as a "privately owned firm, which is incorporated in the US, ..." . Can we as a publicly listed company participate in this tender?<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />b. If so, can we submit this tender using the South African registered, wholly owned subsidiary of [our company]. We understand that the entity would still be paid in USD, which is fine with us. <br /><br />The submission must come from a U.S. firm that meets USTDA's National, Source and Origin Requirements. The definition of a U.S. firm can be referenced here:<br /><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/foia/USTDA_NationalityRequirements.pdf">http://www.ustda.gov/foia/USTDA_NationalityRequirements.pdf</a></p>
<p>6. We are interested in proposing on the USTDA Solar Roof Top PV Feasibility Study in Cape Town using our preformed Joint Venture (JV). Is there anything in USTDA rules that prevents us from bidding this opportunity as JV? I could not find any exclusions, but I thought it best that ask USTDA contracts to make sure. The JV consists of two US firms who have joined forces to better serve clients requiring services in the renewable energy area.</p>
<p>There is no limitation on consideration of bids from Joint Venture entities as long as they meet the definition of a U.S. firm per USTDA's Nationality, Source and Origin Requirements:<br /><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/foia/USTDA_NationalityRequirements.pdf">http://www.ustda.gov/foia/USTDA_NationalityRequirements.pdf</a></p>

<RESPDATE>111913
<CONTACT>Jennifer Van Renterghem, Phone 703-875-4357, Email jvanrenterghem@ustda.gov
<DESC>Please note the following questions have been answered:<br /><br />1. This tender is a feasibility study. However, as a Solar PV developer and financier, we would also like to be part of the execution of rooftop projects that would be the outcome of this study. Can we use same or associate South African entity to bid for implementation phase of the contract - ie. post feasibility project. In other words - would it be acceptable for an entity of our company, possibly the same entity, to do the initial feasibility and the implementation phase of the 3MW project?<br /><br />Task 10 requires the contractor to develop Tender Ready documents for the implementation project. As a result, the contractor (and its sub-contractors) will be in a preferred position in terms of the main project and are thus <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prohibited</span> from participating in the main project. The Grantee and the WCG require the contractor to fairly and carefully advise them through the feasibility study and by means of the reports and therefore cannot also participate in the main project.<br /><br />2. Is the winner of the contract forbidden to provide construction services?<br /><br />As above, the contractor in the feasibility study is prohibited from participating in the main project.<br /><br />3. Could Exhibit 3-2 (Annex 2) be provided, or if not, can USTDA or Grantee clarify the number of buildings / sites that are expected to be analyzed?<br /><br />The list of provisional sites used for the development of Annex 2 is as follows:<br /><br />BUILDING and STREET CONSTRUCTION AREA (M2) NUMBER OF FLOORS<br />1 1 DORP STREET - UTILITAS BUILDING 5 005 13 Floors +1Basement<br />2 3 DORP STREET 2 270 7 Floors +1Mezzanine<br />3 4 LEEUWEN STREET 1 828 5 Floors +1Basement<br />4 46 QUEEN VICTORIA STREET - HUGENOT BUILDING 3 090 3 Floors<br />5 QUEEN VICTORIA STREEET - UNION HOUSE 7 734 12 Floors +1Mezzanine +1Basement<br />6 49 HOPE STREET - GOVERNMENT GARAGE, ROELAND ST. 1 474 2 Floors<br />7 9 DORP STREET 21 784 10 Floors +2 Basement<br />8 4 DORP ST 31 732 25 Floors +2Basement<br />9 27 WALE STREET 18 574 11 Floors +1Basement<br />10 68 ORANGE STREET (Seafare House) 1 607 3 Floors<br />11 ALFRED STREET - LIBRARY SERVICES 16 189 6 Floors +1Mezzanine +1Basement<br />12 7 &amp; 15 WALE STREET 30 923 8 Floors +3Mezzanine +1Basement<br /><br />Other vacant land sites could be considered based on feasibility considerations based on transmission and proximity to the CBD area.<br /><br />4. What is the level of "As-built" documentation available for buildings, structural and electrical?<br /><br />The level of information and documentation is reasonable, sufficient and readily available for the purposes of the feasibility study.<br /><br />5. Will the team have access to every building to assess the structural and electrical systems?<br /><br />Access for contractor staff will be arranged for the various buildings and WCG staff will be available to guide such staff through the various buildings and information provided.<br /><br />6. If the 3MW can be allocated within a few large roofs and ground sites, is that preferred over many smaller systems? Fewer installations will reduce installation cost and complexity, providing the same social / environmental benefits and more energy per dollar invested.<br /><br />Fewer installations is naturally preferable and the WCG will be guided by the recommendations made in the Feasibility Study Report. This is the subject of the Task 9 Implementation Plan<br /><br />7. Is there an existing mechanism / arrangement for selling energy to WCG? Is there a potential for Net Metering or Feed In Tariff legislation?<br /><br />The WCG, as is the case for all power users in the municipal area, purchase electricity from the City Of Cape Town. Depending on size and metering, the various rates are specified and will be made available to the contractor for the feasibility. Currently, net metering is not permitted in the municipal area although various studies and business cases are being developed to enable this. Implementation of net metering appears a long way off and the WCG does not foresee any surplus being capable of being generated from its CBD PV solar installation.<br /><br />8. In the Terms of Reference Task 3, could "Partial self-generation" please be defined?<br /><br />Partial self-generation is where the WCG would only be in a position to generate a portion of its own needs and thereby only reduce its grid demand as opposed to nullify grid demand.<br /><br />9. Does the WCG have a percentage goal in mind, or is it intended that several options be included in the study?<br /><br />The WCG does have an objective but the feasibility study is specifically being undertaken to shape and inform this objective into an achievable goal.<br /><br />10. Can you be more specific about the number of buildings and sites. How many sites (and of what type) will be considered for each of the five scenarios. This is needed to estimate an accurate level of effort for the tasks.<br /><br />See the above 12 sites<br /><br />11. Can you provide clarity on what is meant by "commercial terms" specified in the third bullet point in Task 10. Please clarify if this intended to be draft commercial terms for technical considerations.<br /><br />Commercial terms for these purposes does not mean ordinary legal parameters of contract but specifically refers to those terms which will enable the WCG to ensure successful and satisfactory commissioning of the plant. The WCG carries out projects through contracts and requires specific contract provisions that will enable the WCG to hold contractors liable for complete implementation.<br /><br />12. Please provide clarification on creating TMY dataset. Please specify any required parameters or guidelines to be followed in creating the TMY dataset using only publically available data.<br /><br />The WCG do not require the contractor to undertake new studies to determine TMY datasets. The available datasets must be utilized and the WCG advised in the reports about applicability and reliability. The recommendations required in the reports will necessarily also need to be based on these available datasets.<br /><br />

<DESC>RFI 02:
<p><strong>This posting is hereby amended to extend response date to 18 Nov 2013 by 1700&nbsp;hrs CST.<br /><br /></strong>THIS IS AN RFI ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government is not currently seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent's expense. Small Businesses possessing the capabilities to perform the tasks below are encouraged to reply to this RFI. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any such request is issued.</p>
<p>The Air Force Civil Engineering Center and 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron is conducting market research that will be used to develop an acquisition strategy for the successful award of several Air Force Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to perform construction services.</p>
<p>The government is contemplating issuance of two solicitations: Worldwide Engineering and Construction (WE&amp;C) is anticipated to be solicited as full and open competition with the possibility for a partial Small Business set-aside; Regional Engineering and Construction (RE&amp;C) is anticipated to be solicited as a Small Business set-aside with the possibility for further SB sub-category set-asides and / or full and open competition. Participation in the RFI process is important in that it makes Air Force decision-makers aware of the capabilities that exist in the market. Your response is a key factor in the development of an acquisition strategy for the subject of this RFI.</p>
<p>Feel free to review the PDF version of this questionnaire if you would like to see the whole questionnaire before taking the on-line version. Responses will be collected via the online questionnaire only. DO NOT submit the PDF document in response to the RFI request. Attached are the DRAFT Scope of Work (SOW) for WE&amp;C and RE&amp;C as a reference. <strong>At this time the government is not entertaining questions/comments on the Draft SOWs, RFI #3 will be forthcoming&nbsp;to solicit questions/comments on the Draft SOWs.</strong> Also, included is a map for the anticipated regions on the RE&amp;C contracts. <br /><br />If unable to complete this questionnaire in one sitting, you will need to close the questionnaire window and re-open the questionnaire link to edit your response. The questionnaire will start from the beginning, but will show the responses previously entered. This only works if returning to the questionnaire from the original computer (IP address) used initially. All responses are collected based on IP addresses; only one response per IP address is permitted. This edit process will not work if you try to use a different computer to complete your response.</p>
<p>Data collected will become the property of the Air Force, and will be used to provide us with insight on current construction industry practices, experience, and capabilities. The data collected will not be shared with any entity outside of the Air Force. This questionnaire is being administered for the Air Force by third-party contractor Monterey Consultants, Inc. Monterey has signed Non-Disclosure Agreements in place and is restricted under Organizational Conflict of Interest clauses from sharing submitted information with any party except the Air Force. Monterey is not engaged in this industry and does not plan on doing business within this area in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Neither AFCEC or 772 ESS claim or suggest participation in this questionnaire will result in consideration, or award of a federal contract. Participation in the questionnaire is entirely voluntary and non-participation will not affect the Air Force's consideration of any company for future federal contracts. <br /><br /><strong>All interested contractors should respond to this questionnaire by 18 November 2013 by 1700 hrs CST.</strong> This questionnaire is internet-based, and does not require any special equipment or software beyond a typical web browser capable computer. To participate, visit the following website: www.mcix.com/AFCEC3</p>

<a href="mailto:jeffrey.pacuska@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Command (NSRDEC),  Natick, MA is conducting a market investigation on behalf of the Product Manager-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE), to identify domestic products and/or suppliers of individual water treatment/purification systems with the capability or potential to meet military requirements for removal of Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) from indigenous fresh water sources for Soldier consumption.    <br>    <br>  The technologies shall be compatible with current and future organizational clothing and equipment such as the Individual Water Treatment Device (IWTD), the MOLLE Hydration System, standard military canteens, or both. They must be lightweight (not to exceed 12oz.), easy to use/clean/maintain, low bulk/compact, and capable of producing chemically purified water throughout an operational life of at least 135 liters.  They shall have an unused service life of 180 days, be storage stable for 5 years and be environmentally-safe during use and subsequent disposal.  They shall not be impacted by low temperature exposure/freezing and shall be fully functional on thawing, and be functional in basic, hot and cold environments  <br>    <br>  The technology must be capable of removing chemical contaminants to levels mandated by the US Army Public Health Command (UASPHC) technical bulletin and guidelines (TB MED 577, TG 230A). The water purification time must be not more than 20 minutes (desire less than 15 minutes) with a flow rate (if applicable) of not less than 200 mL/min.  Batteries, if used, must be a commercially-available type and of weight and bulk compatible with the overall device requirements for weight and bulk.  Processed water shall be palatable, with taste/flavor as in commercial bottled spring or municipal waters.  <br>    <br>  Due to the wide range of chemical contaminants that could potentially be found across the scope of global operations, the attached table contains a list of representative chemicals, their challenge concentrations, and their associated Military Exposure Guidelines.  The U.S. Army is interested in identifying firms with products, technologies, and capabilities to reduce the challenge concentrations of these TICs/TIMs to below their associated Military Exposure Guidelines.   <br>    <br>  This notice is for market research only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  No solicitation document exists.  The information received under this announcement may be used to purchase items for Government testing and/or prepare a solicitation package.  <br>    <br>  Interested sources must, no later than 30 November 2013, respond with information on their current commercial product(s) and how they might address the Military requirement.  Interested sources shall include information detailed in the FedBizOps Note 25 regarding a firm's experience, personnel, and facilities.  Information should include product cost, technical information (i.e., technical literature, data and illustrations, photographs, patents), relevant company background/experience, and a sample (optional).

<p>The SCI shall provide worldwide support for current and future DoD customers of batteries and the war fighter's readiness by relying on the private sector's ability to manage and perform all responsibilities required under the supply chain for batteries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Battery customers also include Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the intent of the Government to establish as many Long Term Contracts (LTCs) as possible for the batteries supported.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>LTCs will be established for batteries that DLA currently manages and are normally stocked by DLA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If DLA does not stock the battery, the SCI will be responsible for supporting the NSN by procuring via spot buys and shipping directly to the customer.</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR Part 51, the SCI will be provided ordering authority and shall utilize all designated Government established LTCs in support of this effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Future LTCs for new batteries are supported by the SCI and will be added upon their award via modification to any resulting contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The solicitation will outline the areas of responsibility that the SCI will be required to execute.</p>

<DESC>Modification to SS/RFI dtd 11-14-2013 The EPA thanks the environmental community for the robust response,  from numerous small  and large businesses,  to the SSRFI.  An analysis is underway reviewing the industry response for the next round of Response Action Contracts.  It is anticipated that a Fed Biz Opps notice will be published in early 2014, for all interested parties to submit their technical qualifications, in accordance with FAR Part 36, via the SF330.  Interested vendors  are  reminded that due to the procurement sensitivity of this process  and confidential business information nature of the data that has been collected, EPA is limited as to the information it may share (SSRFI and amendments) regarding the National RAC MAC at this time.     Please contact the Placement Contracting Officer, Jim Clark, at clark.jim@epa.gov if additional clarification is required.   Do not request additional information from any other EPA personnel on this matter.   Please include ?RAC MAC?  in the subject line of any ema ils sent to clark.jim@epa.gov concerning the SSRFI.

<a href="mailto:sstuart1@osmre.gov">sstuart1@osmre.gov</a>
<DESC>The Office of Surface Mining (OSM), Western Regional Coordinating Center, is planning to procure Geotechnical Architecture and Engineering Services in support of the Abandoned Mine Land Program (AML). The services are related to:  (1) site investigations, (2) surveys and development of site maps, (3) development of reclamation design alternatives, (4) identification of environmental effects of proposed construction, (5) preparation of construction specifications and plans, (6) construction cost estimating, (7) monitoring of construction activities, (8) sampling of mine gases and mine drainage, and (9) technical support and use of an existing project management database and ArcGIS mapping system.
All work is directly related to hazards associated with abandoned coal mines.  Hazards at abandoned coal mine sites primarily consist of open shafts and portals, mine subsidence, venting mine gases, and mine drainage.  Most of the sites are located in Washington, and occasionally in the OSM Western Region states of California and Oregon.  Geographic proximity to the Washington project sites is a major consideration in the selection process.  Project sites are determined when the AML projects are identified by the OSM.  The government anticipates awarding one indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract.  The term of the contract shall be one year with four one-year options beginning April 1, 2014.  Exercise of yearly options is at the discretion of the government and subject to the availability of funds.  OSM guarantees a minimum work amount of $25,000 per year.  
The following criteria will be used to evaluate prospective firms and their project teams (including all sub-consultants).  Criteria 1 through 4 are of equal weight, and contribute to a higher portion of the Firms overall ranking.  Criteria 5 is of lesser weight.
1. Specific individual experience and professional qualifications of personnel assigned to the project team, as necessary for performance of required services. 2. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required. 3. Organization and management of the project team and the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. 4. Location of the project team. 5. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.
Architecture and Engineering Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit three copies of completed Standard Form 330  Architecture-Engineering Qualifications, to the office above.  Respondents are encouraged to limit their Standard Form 330 submittal to no more than 50 pages.  Respondents may supplement their submittal with no more than two examples of relevant work (3 copies) prepared by the proposed team.  Firms responding to this announcement by November 29, 2013 will be considered.  This is not a Request for Proposal.

Background This is a modification to the subject sources sought notice originally issued on June 6, 2013 with responses requested by June 24, 2013 regarding a Statement of Capabilities from prospective offerors. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has expanded the SACOM scope of work advertised on June 6, 2013 to include all scope associated with the John C. Stennis Space Centers (SSC) Test Operations Contract (TOC) NNS10AA46C.  The TOC Scope will be consolidated into the SACOM scope along with the previous identified SSC Facility Operating Services Contract (FOSC) NNS07AB21C, and the George C. Marshall Space Flight Centers (MSFC) Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) Manufacturing Support and Facility Operations Contract (MSFOC), NNM09AA20C.  This consolidation will serve as the follow-on competition for all affected contracts.  An updated preliminary acquisition schedule is provided at attachment 2.  It is subject to revision as requirements evolve. Due to subject consolidation SACOM additional work elements may include the following: NASA, as an Agency, is at the threshold of developing new space flight systems to support the countrys exploration vision.  As part of this, SSC is responsible for developmental and/or acceptance propulsion testing at the component, subsystem, and/or system level. In addition to the previous sources sought, NASA/SSC is inquiring into the resources and capabilities available to conduct tests and test support related activities in support of NASA and NASA customer test projects.  	Test Support activities i.e. engineering, operate, maintain and manage test activities, cryogenic commodity storage and distribution, logistics program for propellants and high pressure gas systems, data, including delivery, storage, archiving, and security of test data, secure configuration control and analytical tools and methodologies.	 	Test Project Implementation and Test Performance Capability i.e. project management support, test scheduling, design and development of test systems, drafting, special studies, facility build-up, fabrication and activation of test systems, conducting component testing and/or hybrid rocket motor testing, and conducting test project closeout/reviews.

Other Option work:  If funding permits, this Option covers repairs/replacement of approximately 330 LF of rock sea wall at the southernmost extent of the project area adjacent to  the NASA Launch facility's South Camera Stand.   <br>   c.	Sand fencing will be installed along all restored dunes following Government acceptance of sections.   <br>   d.  Beach grasses will be planted to help stabilize repaire/restored dunes following completion of restoration.   <br>   The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract using INVITATION FOR BID WITH PRE-AWARD SURVEY and procedures outlined in FAR Parts 36 and 14.  Pre-award survey will determine contractor's responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104 and 9.106.   <br>      <br>   Bidders will be evaluated on both pre-award and conformance to the solicitation and price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all Bids and to award the contract to other than the lowest total price and to award to the bidder submitting the lowest bid determined by the Government to be responsible.  The magnitude of construction is estimated between $5,000,000 -$10,000,000.   <br>      <br>   The anticipated date of the solicitation is on or about 15 November 2013.   <br>      <br>   NAICS CODE 237990 applies to this procurement.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer vendor questions previously posted with pending answers.
1.	Vendor Questions Pending Answers:
a.	The EST IRC3 has been discontinued and only minimal replacement parts are available. In the RFP it states that all parts are required at no charge to the VA. Whereas the parts do not exist, what will the successful bidder be required to provide if the manufacturer has discontinued the defective part?
i.	The vendor will be responsible for the replacement part. The assumption is that the vendor has spare parts or can acquire them.
b.	The RFP states that the contractor must be certified for dry chemical extinguishing systems. May this be sub contracted to a certified vendor? If so, will that sub be required to hold ALL the same certifications of the prime, as stated in Section E?
i.	A sub-contractor can be used for this purpose. This particular sub-contractor ONLY has to have the applicable certifications for this job.
