<DESC>NOTE: <BR>(1) This procurement was previously listed under RFP W911QY-10-R-0061. All future announcements regarding this procurement will be listed under RFP W911QY-11-R-0004.<BR><BR>(2) Presolicitation Q&A, the UIPE I1 Draft System Performance Specification, and dimensions of the Thermal Manikin have been posted to the UIPE I1 website and are available for review: https://www3.natick.army.mil/uipe1.html<BR><BR>________________________________________________________<BR><BR>Presolicitation Notice previously listed under W911QY-10-R-0061 follows:<BR><BR>The U. S. Army RDECOM Contracting, Natick Contracting Division on behalf of the Joint Program Office for Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Project Manager-Individual Protection has a requirement for a Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble Increment 1 (UIPE I1). The UIPE I1 will be a single supplemental system that will provide enhanced individual protective capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of psychological, physiological and heat stress associated with garment thermal burden, weight and bulk. It is not intended to replace currently fielded CB garments but will provide an alternative lightweight capability for selected missions. The UIPE I1 will provide protection from CB warfare agents to include retaining protection after exposure to Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) and other environmental contaminants. The garment will be suitable for wear while performing combat operations, whether on land or at sea, in any climate, with minimal impact on combat effectiveness. It will be designed to permit efficient communications and be compatible with current and developmental protective component systems. It will also be compatible with current and developmental clothing and equipment including load-bearing equipment, helmets (i.e., cranial protection), handwear, footwear, body cooling systems, and protective masks of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) and the US Navy (USN). Complete UIPE I1 performance requirements will be delineated in a detailed System Performance Specification (SPS).<BR><BR>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a UIPE I1 that will reduce thermal and physiological burden and reduce weight and bulk, over current Chemical-Biological (CB) protective garments. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the UIPE I1 by basing the design on a modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) product is central to the acquisition strategy.<BR><BR>The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type in which Delivery Orders may be issued for a one year base period and four, one year option periods. The Government envisions delivery orders which shall be Firm-Fixed-Price contracts. The guaranteed minimum order will be the negotiated value of the first delivery order, and the cumulative total of all Delivery Orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $129,000,000 over the life of the contract.<BR><BR>The Government envisions that multiple awards will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make a single award, if in the best interest of the Government. If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or a single successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation. <BR><BR>A small business goal of 30% is in effect and proposals shall address the small business plan. NAICS Code 315211 - Mens and Boys Cut and Sew Apparel Contractors applies with a small business size standard of 500 Employees.<BR><BR>The Government currently estimates that the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be released within the next 15 days, and proposals will be due 30 days after the RFP is released.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a sole source notice for commercial items prepared in accordance with theformat in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in thisnotice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requestedand a written solicitation will not be issued.Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for Field Instruments for the Detection ofLow Energy Radiation (F.I.D.L.E.R.) detectors and cases to replenish its existing stockof F.I.D.L.E.R detectors.  This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request forQuotation to Alpha Spectra, Inc., Grand Junction, CO for the following:Qty/each	ITEM #	Manufacturer	Description24	20DT063QB2/5	Alpha Spectra, Inc.	F.I.D.L.E.R Detectors24	iM3075	Hardigg with Foam Inserts	Storm Case  33.3 in x 24.4 in x 19.3 in (L x W x H) 			Alpha Spectra, Inc. is the manufacture of the Field Instrument for the Detection of LowEnergy Radiation (FIDLER). Alpha Spec is the only US manufacturer of the berylliumwindowed crystal crystal that meets our minimum requirement. The crystal that is used inthe FIDLER is only manufactured within the United States by Alpha Spectra, Inc.  Theberyllium window allows for the detection of low energy x-rays that are given off by thedecay of plutonium 238, which is key for our detection of any released plutonium as aresult of a launch accident. A market survey done by internet and technical phone vendorqueries indicates no comparable monitoring capability is available from any other vendor.  Additionally, this procurement is to supplement existing hardware in use at KSC.  TheGovernment has existing handles and legs to support and hold the detectors from ourprevious inventory of FIDLER detectors with an approximate replacement cost of$27,000.00. The vendor will also provide storage cases for the FIDLER detectors andcustomize the Styrofoam inserts to fit the detector and cut out places to accommodate ourmeters, legs, handles, cables, and spare batteries. If it were found that another vendor could meet the Governments requirements, it wouldintroduce unacceptable delays in terms of time and testing to ensure that a combinationof the two detectors would be compatible and ensure mission success.  Additional costswould also be incurred in coordinating, performing and evaluating such a compatibilitytest, as well as in training personnel how to use or repair the different instrument. Using another detector would introduce unacceptable risk that may lead to mission failureor undue public safety issues. Also, replacing the existing handles and legs wouldincrease the cost of this procurement by approximately $27,000.00.  It is in the bestinterest of the Government to procure the FIDLER and the storage cases from AlphaSpectra, Inc.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their quotation and capabilities and qualificationsto perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 10:00A.M. (EST.) time on December 13, 2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.

<DESC>The national Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Secure Transportation (OST) has a requirement for Flight Instrument Displays, avionics and communications upgrade of up to three Boeing 737-400 Classic aircraft equipped with original Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) cockpits.  The modifications required by this solicitation are for the upgrade of the primary flight displays, navigation displays, engine and fuel instrument displays, avionics, and communications systems. The baseline aircraft used for the development of this proposal should be a Boeing factory-produced 737-400 original EFIS (Cathode Ray Tube displays) aircraft equipped to Part 121/25 CONUS standards.
The intent is to upgrade of one (or more) Boeing 737-400 Classic aircraft from the original Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) Cathode Ray Tube display to an integrated flat panel display system similar to the Next Generatation (NG) 737 cockpit. The Contractor shall design, obtain FAA approval, and install the upgraded avionics system into a government-owned aircraft. The primary objective of the flat panel displays is to integrate a Nex Gen type solution for B737-400 that eliminates legacy avionics, leverages Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology, and provides a baseline design to allow for future upgrades. Additionally, this effort should account for the current Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) mandates, and in turn, account for technology available to meet these mandates. 
The Government may allow use of a Government owened aircraft for use in the approvals process for the STC. 
The requirement is set-a-side for small business.

The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability, no later than 10 days after the date of this publication.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>LOAD CELL AND READOUT BOX SPECIFICATIONS<BR>For Lockport Lock<BR><BR><BR>The Army Corps of Engineers is seeking bids for a long term instrumentation system to monitor cable loads at the Lockport Lock located in Lockport, IL. <BR><BR>Two (2) identical systems will be installed into the 2 identical guard towers on either side of the upper service gate of the lock.  Each of the two systems will consist of seven identical load cells and one readout box to be used by Army Corps Personnel during routine maintenance of the lift mechanism and cables.<BR><BR>The system will be expected to run for longer than the ten to fifteen year life span of the cables.  Historically, the gate is cycled approximately twelve (12) times per day. The fatigue life of the load cell is to be greater than 10,000,000 cycles.<BR><BR>Each load cell is expected to experience a tension load of approximately 35,000 pounds during the normal operation of the gate.  During cable installation and tensioning, loads as high as 50,000 pounds were observed in individual cables.  A load cell should be chosen to withstand 75,000 lbs. maximum working load with a breaking load greater than 200,000 lbs.  The Army Corps plans to implement a maintenance plan to minimize the uneven loading of the cables by utilizing the load cells and readout to rebalance the cables on a regular basis.<BR><BR>The cables are tensioned by a turnbuckle mechanism detailed in the attached drawing.  A 17-4PH stainless steel clevis pin load cell, 2.75inches diameter is to be used.  The pin MK-20/7-6 in the attached drawing will be replaced by the clevis pin load cell.  Each individual load cell pin will have a retainer/keeper.<BR><BR>The system will be placed into identical guard towers on either side of the lock.  Historically, the towers are heated in the winter and temperatures inside of the towers do not fall below 50degreesF.  The operating temperature of the system is to be between -65degrees and 250degreesF. There is no humidity control in the guard towers.  Electronics enclosures should meet NEMA 4 or similar as condensing moisture, falling dirt and dust as well as grease from the cable system will all be present in the installation environment. All electrical connections are to be waterproof. Each load cell electrical cable shall be run to a junction box on the back wall approximately 22inches away from the ends of the existing pins; the cables will then be run in conduit along the back wall for an approximate length of 10.5feet to the readout unit. A site visit can be scheduled with the POC to confirm measurements and installation conditions. <BR><BR>The system will be plugged or hard wired into a standard 120 V AC outlet and include an on/off switch.  The distance from the anticipated location of the readout box to the nearest receptacle is approximately 15 feet. The system should return to an operable/ useable state after an on-off cycle or loss of power.<BR><BR>The complete system is to be installed by the bidder to include start up, calibration, and prestressing. Training on system operation for Corps' employees is to be included in the bid cost.<BR><BR>The bid should include information on the manufacturer and model of the load cells and the display/readout box to be provided. The bid should also include the proposed method of configuring the system (hard wired or with plugs between load cells and readout) and the proposed method of acquiring the individual load cell readouts.<BR>Delivery Date: 80 days after contract award<BR><BR>Delivery Address:<BR>Lockport Lock<BR>2502 Channel Drive<BR>Lockport, IL 60441-4199<BR><BR>POC Doug Ver Cautren<BR>309-676-4601 EX# 206<BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, on behalf ofthe Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ isconducting a market survey to identify potential sources for a multifunctional optic (MFO). This announcement constitutes an official Request forInformation (RFI) and the opportunity to obtain performance data of acompanys MFO by performing lab test and soldier in the loop testing, at theGovernments discretion, of any sample submitted. The purpose of this RFI isto ascertain the performance capability, system technical maturity, user easeof operation and readiness for production of a MFO. Response is requested fromvendors that can function as a prime contractor, and or manufacturer.
This request for information (RFI) is for performance analysis and planningpurposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal or as anobligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services or hardware.Your response to this RFI and any samples submitted in response to this RFIwill be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct orindirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result ofcontractor submission of responses to this announcement or Government use ofsuch information. This request does not constitute a solicitation forproposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract (seeFAR 15.201(e)). No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received forthis effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developingits acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement and PerformanceSpecification. Interested parties are responsible for adequately markingproprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI orto otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to same.  Theinformation provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds theGovernment to pursue any course of action described herein.
BACKGROUND:The U.S. War fighter requires a MFO for rapid and accurate target acquisition,detailed target identification and optimized hit probability which is easy touse, requires limited training to properly employ, and presents limited challenges for obtaining a proper zero on multiple weapons platforms.Historically, the Army has fielded the M68 Close Combat Optic (CCO), the M150Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) and the M145 Machine Gun Optic (MGO) for variousroles in the infantry squad. The MFO is an optical system that maximizes theability to shoot in Close Quarter Shooting (CQS) scenarios while at the sametime maximizing the capability for long distance engagements, as well as rapidtransitioning between both scenarios.  The MFO will ideally serve across allcurrent and future 5.56mm and 7.62mm weapon platforms.
SYSTEM DEFINITION:The MFO desired attributes:1.	Target Acquisition will be maximized for CQS scenarios for a quickreaction response, as well as maximized for mid to long range engagements toensure accurate and precise small arms fire and transition between short andlong range engagements.  At a minimum, the targeting range shall be inclusiveof the range of current fielded 5.56mm and 7.62mm weapon systems (M4, M16,M249, and M240).2.	Minimization of Size, Weight & Power (SWaP) is highly desirable andshould be emphasized to the fullest extent possible.  It is highly desiredthat the total system weight be no more than 1.5 lbs.3.	Allow the Soldier to engage CQS targets by use of a clearlydistinguishable point of aim w/ adjustable center illumination, to enablerapid and effective reflexive fire. The reticle, or aiming system within theoptic, shall provide the ability to estimate range that is accurate,repeatable, and minimizes training required for effective use.4.	In the event of electrical power interruption (if applicable), thescope must be functional during ambient light conditions.5.	The reticle, or aiming system within the optic, will have anadjustable brightness that will work with image intensified devices on the lowend and in full sun brightness on the high end and will have off positionseither between each intensity setting (or some other non intrusive means),allowing the Soldier to quickly go from no illumination/center dot to thedesired brightness in one motion.6.	Battery life shall be a minimum of 700 hours with continuousoperation.  Common batteries already in the Army inventory shall be used (i.e.AA or CR123).7.	Ranging Mil or Stadia lines will be viewable at mid and high powerwithout inhibiting observation, will be usable for elevation hold overs athighest power, and shall require minimal training for operations.8.	MFO shall be parallax free at 25M9.	Eye relief shall be a minimum of 2.5 inches at all times and be ableto continuously adjust for intermediate eye relief.10.	Fully functional in environments ranging from arid, dry desert withblowing sand to 100% humidity, jungle to salt fog, as delineated in MIL-STD-10G.11.	Wear resistant, anti-glare, non-reflective matte finish.12.	Flip-up subdued scope caps provided with each scope or some othersuitable protective measure.13.	Fully compatible with currently fielded Image Intensified devices andthermal inline optics.14.	MFO shall exhibit scratch resistant materials to exposed surfaceslenses, etc.) that minimize wear and tear during operational scenarios.15.	It is desired that minimal training be required to properly zero theMFO to the weapon.
OBJECTIVE:Currently, the Warfighter has multiple optics in the inventory that do notoptimize the elements of target identification, ergonomically allow for rapidand accurate engagements in CQS scenarios, or minimize required training formaximum aptitude.  The intent of this RFI is to understand industryscapability to provide a lightweight, variable power, MFO that maximizes theWarfighters capability for rapid and accurate target identificationthroughout the range of M4, M16, M249, and M240 Weapon systems, and toestablish a list of known sources of such hardware. Respondents to this RFIare requested to provide any performance test data, reports, analysis andsamples for evaluation. The Government will evaluate the data provided andassess the samples quantitatively based on the following criteria: size,weight, accuracy of zero, zero repeatability, degree of collimation,resolution, magnification, parallax, and soldier usability. The governmentalso may perform lab testing, and soldier in the loop testing in the field tofurther quantify the samples performance.  If the contractor so requests,these samples will be returned following completion of characterization of thesample.
RESPONSES:Submission shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages and should be MicrosoftOffice 2007 compatible. Submitted data will not be returned.  If any of thematerial provided contains proprietary information, then mark and identifydisposition instructions.  Responses should include, but are not limited tothe following:
Performance DataTest ReportsSeveral Samples for testingCompany History in designing, producing and delivering systems similar inscope and complexity to the MFO.
SUBMISSION INFORMATION:Responses to the RFI must be received no later than 3:00 PM EST on 31 March2011 both electronically and in hardcopy format. Hardcopy submissions shallconsist of one original and two copies, referencingMarket Survey # W15QKN-11-X-F005.Interested firms should also provide their address, point-of-contact withtelephone number, e-mail address, and type of business (i.e. Small Business,Large Business, 8a Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Service DisabledVeteran Owned Small Business). Any pricing data, if available, should be sentat no cost to the U.S. Government.

<p>3. Tasks</p>
<p>The following tasks comprise the statement of work for the crane engineering services from 10/01/10 to 09/30/12:</p>
<p>a. Prepare calculations showing that the stall loads of hoists are less than the maximum static load capabilities of the bridges of the remaining four groups of typical cranes in nuclear explosive bays and cells.<br />b. Conduct peer review of calculations by qualified engineer who is independent of calculation preparer, resolve issues, and prepare reports of findings and resolutions. <br />c. Prepare addendums for the remaining four work packages covering crane upgrades that identify (1) critical bolts needing chemical and physical analyses, (2) beam coupons needing chemical analyses, and (3) critical welds needing inspections for flaws.<br />d. Update hoist specifications SPEC-020, SPEC-022, and SPEC-023.<br />e. Provide engineering services for other issues concerning safety class cranes that arise between 10/01/10 and 09/30/12.<br />f. Qualify 20 cranes as equivalent ASME NUM-1, Type 1B, cranes.</p>
<p>4. Government-Furnished Property</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>5. Government-Furnished Facilities</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>6. Deliverables</p>
<p>a. Monthly invoices that list tasks assigned and hours spent on completing each of the tasks.<br />b. Calculations that verify the stall loads for hoists in four remaining groups of similar cranes are less than the maximum static load capabilities of the bridges of those cranes.<br />c. Reports of findings on calculations by the independent peer reviewer and dispositions of those findings. <br />d. Addendums for four work packages prepared to upgrade safety class cranes that identify (1) critical bolts needing chemical and physical analyses, (2) beam coupons needing chemical analysis, and (3) critical welds needing to be inspected for flaws. <br />e. Three updated hoist Specifications, i.e. SPEC-020, SPEC-022, and SPEC-023.<br />f. Reports on issues concerning safety class cranes that arise between 10/01/10 and 09/30/12.<br />g. Qualification documents designating twenty cranes as equivalent ASME NUM-1, Type 1B, hoists.</p>
<p>7. Schedule</p>
<p>Because the taskings in this scope of work are dependent on (1) the availability of resources to accomplish crane upgrades and (2) the priorities of emergent issues, the due dates of the items under the taskings will be established when those items are assigned to the crane engineering company. These items will then be tracked and evaluated through monthly invoices submitted by the crane company and by the reports and other documentation submitted regarding the items assigned. The monthly invoices from the crane company will list the items assigned during each month and the hours spent preparing the documentation required to close the items. The hours spent per item will then be evaluated against the complexity of the documentation to determine if the charges are reasonable.</p>
<p>The taskings in this scope of work may require trips by the crane company to Pantex for final discussions on deliverables.<br /></p>

<DESC>Notification of Opportunity<br />Fort Jackson, South Carolina<br />Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) Task Order<br />1. Notice: Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy on behalf of the Fort Jackson Directorate of Public Works plans to award an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) Task Order using the Department of Energy (DOE) Super ESPC indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract. DLA Energy invites the current 16 ESPC contract holders to submit a written response to this notice for our consideration. Only those 16 DOE ESPC awardees are eligible for award. This notice represents only step one of a two step down selection process per the basic DOE ESPC IDIQ, paragraph H.4. Offerors shall comply with Section L and Section M, attached, when preparing their response.<br />2. Authority: The DLA Energy authority is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 23.205 "Energy-savings performance contracts," Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), and DOE Final Rule, 10 CFR 436 Subpart B - Methods and Procedures for Energy Savings Performance Contracting and Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPA , April 10, 1995). <br />3. Site Information: Fort Jackson is the largest and most active Initial Entry Training Center in the U.S. Army, training 50 percent of all Soldiers and 70 percent of the women entering the Army each year. The Fort includes more than 52,000 acres, including more than 100 ranges and field training sites and 1,160 buildings. More than 3,900 active duty Soldiers and their 14,000 family members are assigned to the Installation. Additionally, Fort Jackson employs almost 5,200 civilians and provides services for more than 36,000 retirees and their family members.<br />4. Project Approach: In achieving their energy goals, Fort Jackson is interested in energy conservation measures (ECM) as listed below: <br />ECM Focus Areas:<br />TC.1 Boiler Plant Improvements<br />TC.2 Chiller/Thermal Energy Storage Plant Improvements<br />TC.3 Building Automation Systems (BAS)/Energy Management Control Systems (EMCS) (must integrate into existing wireless Tropos mesh network and Honeywell EBO Energy Monitoring Control System)<br />TC.4 Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning<br />TC.5 Lighting Improvements<br />TC.6 Building Envelope Modifications<br />TC.7 Chilled Water and Hot Water Distribution Systems<br />TC.8 Electric Motors and Drives<br />TC.11 Renewable Energy Systems - Solar PV<br />TC.12 Energy/Utility Distribution Systems<br />TC.14 Electrical Peak Shaving/Load Shifting<br />TC.17 Commissioning<br />TC.18 Advanced Metering Systems (must integrate into the existing Pep wave wireless system)
<p>In addition to these ECMs of interest, the installation would be interested in any other recommended energy conservation measures proposed by the energy service company (ESCO). Be advised that all selected ECMs will have the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) performed by the ESCO.</p>
<p>5. Two Step Down Selection Process: In order to minimize the costs to both the contractors and the Government, DLA Energy will use a two step down selection process to select an ESCO for the final task order award. The resultant task order will be awarded to the offeror that provides the best technical approach for achieving the greatest level of savings using a holistic, comprehensive energy conservation approach at Fort Jackson and results in the least risk and at the most economical and reasonable cost for same energy conservation measures.</p>
<p>Step One: In accordance with the down selection process of the basic IDIQ ESPC contract, paragraph H.3.1.B.4, all sixteen ESCOs will be given an opportunity to submit a package acknowledging interest in the Fort Jackson requirement. In the first step, Notice of Opportunity, offers will be evaluated against the following criteria:<br />Factor 1: Technical Capability <br />Subfactor 1 - Industry Experience<br />Subfactor 2 - Key Project Personnel<br />Factor 2: Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Financial Stability</p>
<p>In the performance price tradeoff source selection procedures for step one of the two step process, a determination of technical acceptability is a prerequisite to the trade-off between past performance and cost/price factors. The order of importance is used to explain how the other factors will be traded off on technically acceptable proposals. After determination of the technically acceptable proposals, in step one of the two step down selection process, Factor 2 (Past Performance) and Factor 3 (Financial Stability) are considered of equal importance. <br />Contractors are not required to submit a cost proposal in the initial down selection process. This selection will focus, in a general nature, on an ESCO's ability to perform previous projects of this magnitude, their current financial capability and their illustration of technical expertise in similar energy projects of this nature. The Government will assess an ESCO's likeliness to successfully perform a project of this magnitude. Up to three ESCOs will be selected during the first step in the two step down selection process.<br /><br />Step Two: The selected ESCOs shall submit a Preliminary Assessment (PA), as detailed in the DOE basic contract paragraph H.4, Preliminary Assessment Content Requirements for Task Orders, which sets out the merits, technical feasibility, and the level of projected energy savings, economics, and cost/price of the project. Full trade off source selection procedures will be utilized with the evaluation of the PAs based on the following evaluation criteria:<br />Factor 1: Mission Capability: Each of the following subfactors is listed in the order of importance for the Mission Capability, Factor 1.<br />Subfactor 1: Technical Feasibility of proposed energy conservation measures <br />Subfactor 2: Holistic Comprehensive Approach<br />Subfactor 3: Guaranteed Cost Savings <br />Factor 2: Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Cost/Price</p>
<p>In the second step of the two step down selection process, Factor 1 Mission Capability is of greater importance than Factor 2 Past Performance. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), Factors 1 Mission Capability and 2 Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 3, Cost/Price, however Cost/Price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. The Government will review the PAs and select one contractor to perform an Investment Grade Audit (IGA). The selected contractor will be issued a Notice of Intent to Award at which time they will begin the IGA as described in paragraph H.5, Investment Grade Audit for Task Orders.</p>
<p>6. Procedures/Process: Interested DOE ESPC contractors shall comply with the Section L, Instruction to Offerors, as attached for the offeror's submission requirements. A site visit will not be necessary nor conducted for step one in the down selection process. Also attached is Section M, Evaluation of Offers, which defines the evaluation criteria that will be used in step one of the two step down selection process. (Note: Separate Section L and Section M will be issued for step two of the down selection process for this acquisition).</p>
<p>7. Submission Requirements: All interested ESCOs should provide the above required information to DLA Energy no later than 07 Jan 2011, 4:00 PM. EST. Emailed responses to the Notice of Opportunity are not acceptable. Please submit your offer in two (2) hard copies and one (1) electronic CD format to either of the following at:</p>

<p><br />Attachment 1<br />Fort Jackson Site Data and Description</p>
<p>Fort Jackson is located in the city of Columbia, the capital and largest city in South Carolina. Columbia is in the center of the state residing in Richland County.</p>
<p>Utility Systems:<br />Fort Jackson receives their electric utility service from South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company (SCE&amp;G) and natural gas is purchased from SCE&amp;G for heat and hot water generation. The potable water supply is provided by the City of Columbia.</p>
<p>Fort Jackson purchases electricity under a standard General Service Administration (GSA) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract from SCE&amp;G without a term limitation at the utility company's Large General Service billing rate. There is a single 115 kilo-volt (kV) overhead distribution line to SCE&amp;G's substation located at the intersection of Lee Road and Hill Street. It has a capacity of 44.8 mega-volt-amperes (MVA) and steps the voltage down to 8.32 kV. The 8.32 kV distribution system consists of approximately 64 miles of overhead and underground, primary and secondary lines. The power is stepped down to usable building voltages at transformers located in the vicinity of each building. The distribution system is owned by Fort Jackson and maintained by the Installation's Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Department. SCE&amp;G plans to construct a second 44.8 MVA substation in the northwest corner of the installation in 2011. Both substations have the capability for expansion should the installation's future consumption exceed 89.6 MVA. The central energy plants consume the largest amount of electricity at Fort Jackson.</p>
<p>The natural gas distribution system consists of 37 miles of underground piping from the gas distribution station. The majority of the piping is iron which dates to the 1940's and 60's and is considered to be in fair condition. Some plastic gas piping has been installed more recently and is reported to be in good condition. Cathodic protection for the entire gas system has been installed to limit corrosion. Natural gas is mostly used for space and water heating throughout the installation. Natural gas usage is highest during the cooler months of the year. Natural gas end users are individual buildings with standalone energy plants, individual buildings with gas fired HVAC and water heating equipment, and the central energy plant boilers. As with electrical energy, the largest consumers are the central energy plants.<br />The water distribution system was originally owned and operated by Fort Jackson, but was privatized in 2008 to Palmetto State Utility Services. The infrastructure of the system has been expanded over time with a variety of piping materials, including asbestos concrete, metal, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping. A large portion of water is used for drinking, personal hygiene, and equipment maintenance associated with the basic training mission. A large amount of water is also expected to be lost due to leaks through the central energy plant distribution and potable water systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service tariffs are commercial rates with average costs as follows:<br />Electricity - Average electricity rate: $0.042 - $0.073 / kWh plus peak demand charges<br />Natural Gas - Average natural gas rate: $ 7.55 / kcf<br />Water: - Commodity charge rate - $2.07 / kgal<br />Sewer: - Commodity charge rate - $1.13 / kgal</p>
<p>The following tables illustrate the historic utility consumption at Fort Jackson:</p>
<p>Total Energy Consumption (MBtu)<br />Year Total Energy (MBtu)<br />FY03 957,472 <br />FY04 940,667 <br />FY05 1,041,465 <br />FY06 1,020,939 <br />FY07 926,025 <br />FY08 984,473 <br />FY09 1,067,143</p>

<p>Fort Jackson desired focus areas for energy conservation measures include: boiler plant improvements, chiller plant improvements, Building Automation Systems (BAS)/Energy Management Control Systems (EMCS), lighting improvements, building envelope modifications, renewable energy systems (solar PV), electrical peak shaving/load shifting, and commissioning). The following systems descriptions provide background information on select components of the existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Central Energy Plant systems<br />Four central energy plants (CEPs) serve a total of approximately 150 buildings at Fort Jackson with a combined floor area of 3.7 million SF. CEPs #1 and #2 are the largest and oldest, having been built in the 1960s. CEP #3 was built in the early 1970s. CEP #4 was built recently in 2006.</p>
<p>All central boilers are dual-fueled and primarily use natural gas, burning fuel oil only when economics dictates a switch. The boilers operate year-round to provide service hot water as well as meeting the seasonal space heating load. The water-cooled chillers run only during the summer months.</p>
<p>Most of the hot water distribution piping at Fort Jackson is insulated steel installed in shallow concrete trenches. Much of the original piping was replaced in 2002. Exceptions are the piping for about 25% of the buildings served by CEP #1, which was replaced in 1985 and an original section of direct-buried piping that serves the hospital area loop from CEP #2. Another exception is the piping serving CEP #3, which dates to the construction of this plant in 1986.</p>
<p>Chilled water piping is a mixture of insulated steel and PVC that is direct buried. Buildings in the 2000 area of CEP #1 are generally served by PVC, while buildings in the 3000 area of CEP #1 and 4000 area of CEP #2 are generally served by the original steel piping installed in the 1960s. The PVC replacement piping was installed in 1991. CW piping materials associated with buildings served by CEP #3 and building numbers 5000 and higher are as originally constructed, with vintages dating back to 1980, but the specific construction materials were not identified.</p>
<p>Thermal storage Tank<br />There is a 2.25 million gallon thermal storage tank integrated into the Installation cooling system.</p>
<p>Building Automation Systems (BAS)/Energy Management Control Systems (EMCS)<br />The Installation's controls systems have components provided by several manufactures and vary in age and effectiveness. Opportunities for improvement include continued optimization of control strategies including schedules, set-points, and other operational parameters that will also improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Lighting<br />Lighting systems within the buildings consist of numerous fixture types varying in age and condition. Some buildings or areas within buildings utilize energy-efficient lighting technology. However, opportunities still exist to install energy efficient fixtures and controls for interior and exterior lighting throughout the Installation</p>
<p>Building Envelope<br />A significant energy opportunity includes enhancing building envelopes, which consists of upgrading windows, insulation, and doors, as well as sealing air leaks. Due to their age, many facilities are candidates for these enhancements.</p>
<p>Renewable Energy<br />The location of Fort Jackson provides for several alternatives for renewable energy. Waste-to-energy sources, such as landfill methane, are available both on the installation and in the nearby community. Fort Jackson also benefits from very good solar source availability. Finally, South Carolina has moderate biomass and hydrogen resources.</p>

<p>ATTACHMENT 3<br />SECTION M</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING PERFORMANCE PRICE <br />TRADEOFF PROCEDURES</p>
<p>Step One of the Two Step Process</p>
<p>A. BASIS FOR SELECTION<br />The first step of this two step acquisition will utilize Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) source selection procedures to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision. In order to minimize the costs to both the contractor and the Government, DLA Energy will use a two step process to select a contractor for the task order contract award. The task order will be awarded to the offeror that provides the best technical approach for the greatest level of savings using achieving holistic, comprehensive energy conservation efforts at Fort Jackson and results in the least risk and at the most economical and reasonable cost for same energy conservation measure. <br />In accordance with the down selection process of the basic IDIQ ESPC contract, paragraph H.3.1.B.4, all sixteen ESCOs will be given an opportunity to submit a package acknowledging interest in the Fort Jackson requirement. The submission will be evaluated based on criteria of equal importance for past performance and financial stability for all technically acceptable offers. Contractors are not required to submit a cost proposal in the initial down selection process. This selection will focus in a very general nature of their ability to perform previous projects of this magnitude, their current financial capability and their illustration of their technical expertise in similar energy projects of this nature. The focus of this selection will be the likeliness to successfully perform a future project of this magnitude. Up to three ESCOs will be selected during this first step in the two step down selection process.<br />While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>B. NUMBER OF CONTRACTS TO BE AWARDED <br />The Government intends to award one task order for this requirement following the completion of the two step source selection process. However, the Government reserves the right not to award a task order at all, depending on the quality of the offers, proposals and prices submitted.</p>
<p>C. EVALUATION FACTORS<br />1. Offers:<br />Award will be made to the offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors listed below.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability <br />Subfactor 1 - Industry Experience<br />Subfactor 2 - Key Project Personnel<br />Factor 2: Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Financial Stability</p>
<p>2. Order of Importance:<br />In PPT, technical acceptability is a prerequisite to the trade-off between financial stability and past performance. The Order of Importance is used to explain how the other factors will be traded off on technically acceptable proposals.</p>
<p>After determination of the technically acceptable proposals, in step one of the two step down selection process, Factor 2 (Past Performance) and Factor 3 (Financial Stability) are considered of equal importance.</p>
<p>3. Evaluation Methodology:<br />The Government evaluation teams will evaluate the technical capability, past performance and financial stability factors simultaneously to facilitate an expeditious contract award. However, only those offers that receive a final "acceptable" rating for the technical capability factor shall be considered for the overall assessment offerors. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical capability factor on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable, reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable, or unacceptable. The proposals shall be evaluated against the subfactors listed in paragraph (4) below.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated as described in the paragraph (5) below. Financial stability will be evaluated as described in paragraph (6) below. The SSA will then review all evaluated offers to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.</p>
<p>4. Factor 1 - Technical Capability:<br />Each subfactor within the technical capability factor will receive one of the ratings described below based on the criteria listed below. Individual subfactor ratings will be used to determine the overall technical acceptability of each offer. To be determined technically acceptable at the factor level, the Offeror must be rated acceptable in each subfactor. A final unacceptable subfactor assessment will determine an overall technical unacceptable rating.</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>REASONABLY SUSCEPTIBLE OF BEING MADE ACCEPTABLE - The proposal does not clearly meet some specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance, but there is reason to believe that through minor revisions, an acceptable proposal could result. For award without discussions these proposals are considered "Unacceptable."</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an Unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Industry Experience: The criteria are met when the contractor illustrates previous technical experience with contracts including the following technical experience:<br />a) chiller/thermal energy storage plant improvements; <br />b) Building Automation Systems (BAS)/Energy Management Control Systems (EMCS) experience; <br />c) experience communicating over a wireless mesh network system; <br />d) heating, ventilating, and air conditioning; and <br />e) electrical peak shaving/load shifting.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Key Project Personnel: The Government will assess the offeror's proposed key personnel management approach for the project. The subfactor threshold (minimum) is met when the offeror's proposal adequately demonstrates all of the following essential components:<br />1) Identification of appropriate key positions and definition of their responsibilities in both the management/administrative staff, as well as the field construction staff (including positions such as Project Manager, Project Superintendent, Safety Monitors and Quality Control Monitors). Also, identification of positions to be filled by subcontractors or temporary/part-time employees and provide information as to the qualifications required to fill such positions. Identification of levels of authority for key positions, including authority to sign contractual documents, authorize modifications, authorize field changes (not involving cost increases), make progress reports, submit Requests for Information (RFIs), provide material submittals and ability to direct subcontractors.<br />2) Acceptable approach to hire, manage, retain and replace personnel who have the knowledge, experience training, and required certifications (if any), to perform under this contract.</p>
<p>5. Factor 2 - Past Performance:<br />The past performance evaluation assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror's ability to successfully perform the solicitation requirements while meeting schedule, budget, and performance quality constraints as defined in the solicitation. The evaluation is based on recency, relevancy, and a demonstrated record of performance. The past performance factor will receive one of the following performance confidence assessments:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TABLE 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION<br />SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />LIMITED CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p><br />(i). Evaluation Process - The past performance evaluation considers the offeror's demonstrated record of performance in providing products and services that meet customer's needs. The Government may consider past performance in the aggregate in addition to on an individual contract basis. In conducting the past performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the offeror's past performance proposal submission and information obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and commercial sources as well as interviews with Government customers and commercial clients. It may also include interviews with any other sources known to the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Recency Assessment - An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. To be recent, the ESPC effort must have been performed during the past five (5) years from the date of issuance of this Notice of Opportunity. Past performance information that fails this condition may not be evaluated. NOTE: If any part of the performance falls within the above timeframe, the contract in its entirety may be evaluated for past performance.</p>
<p>(iii) Relevancy Assessment - The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine how closely the products provided/services performed under those contracts relate to the description of work in the Notice of Opportunity. A relevant contract is one that illustrates experience in developing, designing, implementing and funding an energy conservation effort.</p>
<p>A relevancy determination of the offeror's past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations. In determining relevancy for individual contracts, the Government will consider the portion of the effort accomplished on previous/current contracts compared to the portion to be performed on the proposed effort. For example: Past Performance for a subcontractor for Project Management will only be considered if that same subcontractor is to perform Project Management on the proposed effort. The Government will not be bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy.</p>
<p>The Government will use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TABLE 2 - RELEVANCY DEFINITIONS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION<br />Highly Relevant Present/past performance efforts involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant Present/past performance efforts involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat<br />Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>(iii) Performance Quality Assessment - The Government will consider the performance quality of recent, relevant efforts. The quality assessment consists of an in-depth evaluation of past performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS and commercial sources as well as interviews with Government customers and commercial clients. It may also include interviews with any other sources known to the Government. The quality assessment may result in positive or adverse findings. Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system. For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider the number and severity of the problem(s), mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in sustained improvements. Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated. The Government will use the following quality levels when assessing recent, relevant efforts:</p>
<p>TABLE 3 - PERFORMANCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT<br />Quality Assessment Description<br />EXCEPTIONAL (E)<br />(BLUE) Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many (requirements) to the Governments benefit. <br />VERY GOOD (VG)<br />(PURPLE) Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some (requirements) to the Governments benefit. <br />SATISFACTORY (S)<br />(GREEN) Performance meets contractual requirements. <br />MARGINAL (M)<br />(YELLOW) Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractors proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.<br />UNSATISFACTORY<br />(RED) Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear, or were, ineffective.</p>
<p>(iv) Assigning Ratings - As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating identified in Table 1 above. Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the Technical Capability subfactors, the resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at the factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor. More relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or relevant effort. A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating. Any offer receiving a rating of "No Confidence" will not be considered for selection.</p>
<p>6. Factor 3 - Financial Stability<br />The Government will utilize the comprehensive &lsquo;Credit eValuator Plus' credit report authored by Duns and Bradstreet (D&amp;B) in determining a company's financial stability as acceptable or unacceptable. D&amp;B furnishes ratings on estimated financial strength, promptness of trade payments, and capital adequacy, plus statistical data, such as financial performance ratios of rated companies. D&amp;B reports provide a complete view of current and future financial performances for U.S. businesses.</p>
<p>D. DISCUSSIONS<br />It is the Government's intent to make a selection without discussions; therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their complete information and best terms initially.</p>
<p>E. NOTICE OF OPPORTUNITY REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />Offerors are required to meet all Notice requirements in accordance with the basic DOE IDIQ ESPC contract, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for selection. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the Notice and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>

<SUBJECT>Examine zero-income SNAP units
<SOLNBR>FNS-ORA-01
<RESPDATE>122010
<CONTACT>Belal Hammad, Contract Specialist, Phone 7033052262, Email belal.hammad@fns.usda.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a procurement for research study in 2011 and is seeking statements of capability from potential offerors. Preference will be given to small businesses with experience and staffing to perform the requirement as demonstrated in the capability statement.
<p>Study Overview<br />The purpose of the study is to examine the characteristics, circumstances, and spending patterns of zero-income SNAP units. The percentage of zero-income units has been steadily increasing, and the pattern of increase started long before the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009. Generally, the SNAP caseload closely follows the national unemployment rate, but the relationship is less clear for zero-income units. For instance, the national unemployment rate hovered between 3.9 and 5.9 percent between 1999 and 2008, but the percentage of zero-income units increased each year, doubling from 8.5 percent in 1999 to 17.6 percent in 2009. The study will provide: <br />1.Descriptive analysis of the characteristics of zero-income SNAP units including demographic information, SNAP recipiency history, and measures of participation dynamics, including entry rates, spell lengths, exit rates, and reentry rates. <br />2.An analysis of spending patterns based on EBT Transaction Records. <br />3.Examination of units' circumstances including variability in their zero-income status, family composition, sources of income if/when they have income, and survival strategies.</p>
<p>Study Objectives and Research Questions<br />The proposed study builds upon cross-sectional data developed in a prior study. It seeks to better understand zero income units on the SNAP caseload currently and over time. The study can be considered in two parts: (1) A longitudinal component considering the circumstances of zero-income units using SIPP data, and including redemption patterns of zero-income units over several years using EBT data, and (2) a qualitative component providing greater detail on the characteristics and circumstances of a subset of zero-income units. <br />Objective 1: What are the circumstances of zero-income units now and in the past, and how do those circumstances compare to other SNAP units and non-SNAP units with similar income? The income groups could be divided into several subgroups, such as zero-income, 50 percent of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), 100 percent of FPL, and 200 percent FPL. This is a longitudinal component considering the dynamics of program participation for zero-income units using SIPP data, as well as benefit redemption patterns as evidenced in EBT Transaction Data.<br />Objective 2: Provide an in-depth view of low-income units' characteristics and circumstances through in-person qualitative interviews with 50 units. This is a qualitative component providing greater detail on the characteristics and circumstances considered in Objective 1 above of a subset of zero-income units. The most important research question for Objective 2 is to determine how, with zero income, the units are surviving. The purpose of the interviews is to provide greater depth and insight into the lives of zero-income units.</p>
<p>Data Sources and Sampling<br />There will be three data sources for this study:<br />1.Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP): The SIPP is an on-going, nationally-representative survey conducted by the US Census Bureau. The latest panel's sample size was about 46,000 households. As its name suggests, it collects data on households' cash and in-kind income sources, from paid employment to public programs, such as SNAP and social security income. Data is collected through a continuous series of national panels ranging from two and a half to four years, with the same households being interviewed at regular intervals during the panel period. Interviews are conducted in-person and on the phone and use computer assisted survey methods. All household members 15 years old and over are interviewed, although proxy response is allowed in some cases. The survey has two parts - a core section, which includes questions on labor force, program participation, and income; and topical modules, which are given at different times and cover a variety of income or program topics, such as child support, school enrollment, and taxes.<br />2.EBT Transactions data: There are two types of EBT data. FNS has a database that links QC and EBT data that FNS will provide to the contractor upon award to use for the analysis.<br />a.ALERT: The Anti-Fraud Locator for EBT Redemption Transaction (ALERT) data have a record of every EBT transaction for each SNAP household. Each record contains the store identification number, SNAP household account number, EBT card number, date and time of transaction, transaction type and amount, and account balance. <br />b.STARS: The Store Tracking and Redemption Subsystem (STARS) data have a record of each retailer authorized to accept SNAP benefits. Each record in the extract contains a store identification number, location (city, state, ZIP code), business type (supermarket, grocery, convenience, specialty, and so on), and total annual eligible food sales.<br />3.In-Person Interviews with Zero-Income Units: An important component of this study will be qualitative interviews with zero-income units. Using semi-structured, in-person interviews with approximately 50 units, the contractor will gather information about the characteristics, circumstances, and buying patterns of zero-income units. Interviews would be in-person and between one and two hours long. This is not intended to be a representative sample, but should reflect the overall pattern of characteristics of zero-income units discussed in the Background Section . For instance, one would anticipate most interviewees to be single-person units, split approximately evenly between ABAWDs and those not subject to work requirements.</p>
<p>Offerors are expected to have principal investigators who are PhD-level researchers with expertise in quantitative and qualitative research methods. For the quantitative work, senior-level staff must have experience working with large, nationally-representative surveys with complex survey design. This would include knowing how to properly link longitudinal data files, and having familiarity with using sampling weights, considering the survey's complex design on calculating standard errors, choosing appropriate significance tests, and other issues relevant to complex survey design. In addition, senior-level staff must have expertise with qualitative interviewing, which includes a sampling scheme that ensures completing the desired number of interviews, conducting research-quality interviews, using qualitative software to code and analyze data, and linking qualitative findings to quantitative findings in the analysis, reporting, and conclusions.</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted to belal.hammad@fns.usda.gov NO LATER THAN 4:00 p.m. on December 20, 2010. Responses will be considered solely for information purpose only. This is not a request for proposal (RFP) and responses may or may not be used for future RFP. The Government is under no obligation to pursue further action on this request. <br />For questions concerning this notice, please contact Belal Hammad, Contract Specialist, at 703-305-2262.</p>
<p>Please limit the length of the packages to 20 pages. Packages over 20 pages will not be assessed.</p>

<DESC>Distribution approved for Public Release; distribution unlimited, per DoD 5230.24 and OPSEC/Security Review conducted  9 December 2010.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.201(e).  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research to obtain information on responsible sources that can provide a Non-Lethal Weapons Professional Military Education (NLW PME) course geared to senior military field commanders/planners and senior civilians on behalf of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD). 

Background:
The purpose of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program is to provide war fighters a family of non-lethal weapon systems with a range of capabilities across the full spectrum of threats and crises.
  Non-Lethal weapons are defined as weapons, devices and munitions that are explicitly designed and primarily employed to immediately incapacitate targeted personnel or material, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel and undesired damage to property in the target area or environment. Non-lethal weapons are intended to have reversible effects on personnel and material.  These escalation-of-force options can range from simple, commercially available items such as bean-bag rounds, pepper spray and entangling devices to directed-energy systems that provide non-lethal effects at greater distances.  Non-lethal weapons have applications in numerous military scenarios, including deterring potentially dangerous individuals at extended ranges, stopping suspicious vehicles and rendering enemy assets inoperable with little or no collateral damage.
  These escalation-of-force tools provide the commander flexible options, both in time and range, to the diverse and challenging threats our forces face.  Non-lethal weapons do not replace lethal force options but rather expand the force options available to war fighters so they can tailor their capabilities to mission needs. 

The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) sponsors a Non-Lethal Weapons Professional Military Education (NLW PME) elective course that is offered at Intermediate and Senior Service Colleges, such as the Marine Corps Command & Staff College, the National Defense University, the Air War College, and the Army War College.  The typical course length is between 24-30 hours of instruction over a 10 week period.
  The intent of the course is to provide the student with a better understanding of the applicability of NLWs in an operational environment, as well as, considerations to be made during operational planning.   

Requirement:
JNLWD is seeking potential sources that have conducted similar Non-Lethal Weapons courses, including discussion of current and future non-lethal technologies and the implications of their use. 

Responses should be limited to no more than five pages, single spaced, in 10 point or greater font. Responses should include the following:

1.	A cover page, not included in the page count, identifying the submitting organization, its CAGE Code, address and a technical point of contact with corresponding telephone number and email address.
 The cover page should also indicate the organizations size, i.e. large, foreign, small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.   

2.	Brief description of the each course taught/proposed including topics covered and the level at which courses were taught, i.e. undergraduate or graduate.

3.	Curriculum vitae (CV) for prospective instructors.  CV will not count towards the maximum page limit.

4.      The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, size: $7.0M.  Firms shall indicate their business size based upon NAICS code 611430.

MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request for information.
 Interested parties are requested to submit a response in a Microsoft Office compatible format by 07 January 2011.  Only electronic submissions will be accepted. Interested sources shall send responses via e-mail to gerald.francom@usmc.mil.  E-Mail responses should identify the submitting organization and include Sources Sought Number M67854-11-I-7006 in the subject line.  THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY SERVICES/ITEMS.

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has an ongoing requirement for lease of antenna sites at site-specific locations. ATF has determined that it is in the Government's best interest to award these requirements with a base year and up to four option years. The vendor names, site locations, and estimated costs (for Years 2011-20xx) are identified below.
<p>&bull; Jefferson County 9-1-1 Dispatch, House Springs ,MO; Site: House Spring, MO; Estimated value: $28,058.05<br />&bull; Jordon Realty Inc. ,Pottsville, PA; Hazelton Tower; Estimated value; $55,981.07<br />&bull; M.E.

<p>These contractors retain ownership of the individual towers where ATF's communications equipment is located. These sites were selected based on a survey conducted to determine what sites could meet the needs of ATF's Private Land Mobile (LMR) system which provides administrative and tactical radio communication coverage needs. Criterion includes:<br />1) Provides the maximum transmit capability<br />2) Receives coverage range for clear as well as encrypted transmissions<br />3) Provides minimal interference on receive frequency<br />4) Provides the best level of safety for ATF agents in the field<br />5) Equipment housing facility and height<br />6) Utility support<br />7) Security<br />8) RF noise level/interference<br />9) Site access<br />10) Telco Access <br />11) Cost</p>
<p>In support of ATF's LMR systems' infrastructure needs, communication equipment is installed and housed in various locations throughout the Continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. The locations include remote, mountainous, rural, and/or metropolitan sites. A yearly site lease is established where ATF communications equipment is housed and renewed annually thereafter as long as there is an existing need for LMR coverage to support ATF operations. THIS IS A PARTIAL SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 531390 with a size standard of $2 million dollars. Any award resulting from this requirement will be issued pursuant to FAR Part12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide this service, at the above designated locations, interested parties may submit technical literature showing their capability of meeting the Government's requirement by December 10, 2010 at 2:00 PM EST. E-mail your response demonstrating your firms experience and capabilities to Simone Rittenhouse at simone.rittenhouse@atf.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Kansas City Plant (KCP) seeks partners for commercializing a new patent-pending heavy oil sands processing concept that enables the separation of oil from sand without the use of water.  This environmentally benign process has potential applications for on-site processing where water is difficult to obtain, such as reserves found within the Uinta Basin, Utah.  This clean process also removes environmental issues tied to waste water contamination, including naphthenic acid and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  This technology involves a two-step process using limonene extraction followed by liquid/supercritical carbon dioxide to remove the residual oil/limonene from the sand.  This closed loop process returns both clean limonene and carbon dioxide to the loop, while extracting the oil for final processing.<br /><br />
<p>The KCP anticipates that partnerships to commercialize this technology will take the form of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) accompanied by patent license agreements or options.</p>
<p>The KCP is an advanced manufacturing facility managed and operated by Honeywell Federal Manufacturing &amp; Technologies LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell Corporation, for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) under Contract DE-AC04-01AL66850.</p>

<SOLNBR>04-09-161

<CONTACT>Adelis M. Rodriguez, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-492-3623, Fax 301-492-3437, Email adelis.rodriguez@nrc.gov
<DESC>The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to perform a non-competitive contract modification to increase the value of the contract NRC-04-09-161. This firm fixed priced contract was awarded to James J. Johnson and Associates for the work related to analysis of the dynamic response of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Power Plant (KKNPP) during the July 16, 2007 Niigata Prefecture Chuetsi-Oki earthquake and development of an associated lesions learned report on items of interest by the NRC.
<p>As part of phase 3 of the contract, the contractor was required to participate in benchmarking exercises organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to analyze models and perform analytical methods based on information provided by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) under agreement with IAEA. As a result of a review meeting during May 2010, the IAEA increased their requirements for participants in benchmarking exercise for structure response. The increase in requirements will require the contractor to review and re-analyze the soil and structure models that were submitted in the reports as deliverables for previous phases in this project. The current value of the contract is $257,700. The estimated cost of this additional work is $30,000, which will bring the contract value to $287,700.</p>
<p>The contract was initially awarded as a sole source, under FAR 6.302-1 (b)(1), which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy NRC's requirements. The justification for the sole source award was Dr. James J. Johnson's unique knowledge of the post-earthquake condition of the KKNPP because he visited the KKNPP shortly after to assess damage of the plant first hand and develop lessons learned and recommendations for the IAEA as part of the IAEA review team. Since the proposed modification is an extension of the current work performed, he is considered the only responsible source to perform the work under this modification.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is neither a request for quotation nor a solicitation of offers. Interested respondents must submit a written capability statement, including technical information sufficient to demonstrate a bona fide written capability to meet this requirement, to the point of contact of this posting no later than 7 calendar days from the date announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic, email and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered. If no response is received within 7 calendar days award of the contract modification will be made to James Johnson and Associates.</p>

<p><strong>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Contracting Division (AFRL/RWK) is soliciting cost and technical proposals for the Flight Vehicle Integration Branch (AFRL/RWAV) on the following research effort: Integrated Precision Ordnance Delivery System (IPODS) Phase IIA and Phase IIB, Preliminary Development and Component Test. Phase IIB must be submitted as an option. The Government is requesting proposals for new, innovative and creative solutions to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology discussed in this BAA.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that technical and cost proposals will be evaluated with the intent of negotiating two contracts for Phase IIA. After 12 months, the Government will down-select to one contractor with the intent to exercise the Phase IIB option to the winning contractor to continue the preliminary development and component testing of the IPODS technologies. It is the Government's intent to award the remaining Phases (III-IV) to the Phase IIB winner; however, the Government reserves the right to award one or no contracts pursuant to this BAA. Upon completion of Phase IIB, it is anticipated that Phase III would further refine the design for a Detailed Development and System Level Test. Additionally, there may be a Captive Flight Demonstration under an optional Phase IV. This is a full and open competition; not limited to the offerors awarded the IPODS Phase I contracts.</p>
<p>(1) Introduction: IPODS serves as a technology development and maturation program for a weapon needed to attack tunnel targets and hold at risk critical mission areas behind blast doors. These technologies will also provide alternate payload delivery capabilities in areas to be determined.</p>
<p>(2) Program Objective: The fundamental objective of the IPODS Program is to advance component technologies for an airborne released, highly maneuverable weapon capable of defeating internal tunnel defenses and mission areas of tunnels. The IPODS shall be compatible with multiple Air Force aircraft using existing carriage hardware. Key technical tasks of Phase IIA and IIB include preliminary development and component level testing. Phase III includes detailed development and system level testing of the IPODS concept and the Optional Phase IV is a captive flight demonstration.</p>
<p>(3) Technical Requirements: IPODS will be designed to, and evaluated on, its ability to meet the performance requirements listed in the System Requirements Document (SRD), which is found in Annex A. Additional technical information and aircraft compatibility information is found in Annex B. A Certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, is required to be submitted to the Deputy Program Manager in order to receive the Annexes. See Section/Paragraph I(9)(d) for further details on how to request the Annexes.</p>
<p>(4) Program Tasking: The program is anticipated to include four phases.</p>
<p>a) Phase IIA Preliminary Development and Component Test: Refer to Section/Paragraph V for evaluation criteria details. See Section/Paragraph II(3) for anticipated Periods of Performance. Under Phase IIA, the contractor shall accomplish the preliminary development and component testing of the IPODS technologies.

The Cover page is NOT included in the page count.</p>
<p>(3) Funding Restrictions: The cost of preparing Proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.</p>
<p>(4) Contractual Authority: Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise obligate the Government. The Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts, based on the proposals received and the requirements of the Government. <br /><br /><strong>V. PROPOSAL/APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>(1) Phase IIA Proposal Evaluation Criteria: Phase IIA proposals will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section I of this BAA, utilizing the Factors and Subfactors below. Factor 1 through Factor 3 shall be used as the evaluation criteria for the Phase IIA selection. Additionally, a risk assessment (See Section/Paragraph V(1)(d)) will be made of the offeror's proposals, and selections will be made based on the Best Value to the Government. Awards may be made without discussions. Proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following evaluation criteria. Factors and Subfactors identified below are of equal importance.</p>
<p>a) Phase IIA Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit</p>
<p>Subfactor (1)(i) Soundness and scope of offeror's proposed technical approach and consistency with established systems engineering practices as described in Defense Acquisition Guidebook Chapter 4 (https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=332951)</p>
<p>Subfactor (1)(ii) Extent to which the offeror demonstrates that the defined requirements (See Section I) can be accomplished with the proposed technology</p>
<p>Subfactor (1)(iii) Scope, traceability and feasibility of proposed analysis and test plans</p>
<p>b) Phase IIA Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience</p>
<p>Subfactor (2)(i) Personnel/Management: Experience and capabilities of key personnel (both technical and management); experience and capabilities to manage technical risks, control cost and schedule.</p>
<p>Subfactor (2)(ii) Facilities, equipment and techniques necessary to accomplish the project.</p>
<p>Subfactor (2)(iii) Subcontract Management: Experience and capabilities to manage subcontractor performance, cost and schedule; nature and extent of reliance on subcontractor. <br /><br />Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Experience should be relevant to the tasks identified in this BAA, to include design, development and flight testing of weapon systems. The government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.</p>
<p>c) Phase IIA Factor (3) Cost: Cost Realism and Cost Analysis:</p>
<p>Subfactor (3)(i) Proposed cost is realistic for work to be performed and consistent with the methods of performance and material described in offerors' technical proposals.</p>
<p>Subfactor (3)(ii) Proposed cost is fair and reasonable based on a cost analysis.</p>
<p>The total cost to be evaluated will include the cost of performing the contract, the cost of testing, and any applicable offsets for GFP or acquisition of data rights.</p>
<p>d) Risk Assessment: Risk will be assessed at each Subfactor level as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. The following definitions will be used during the risk assessment:</p>
<p>(i) High: Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.</p>
<p>(ii) Moderate: Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>(iii) Low: Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>(2) Review and Selection Process for Phase IIA: The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>a) Category I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p>b) Category II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p>c) Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p>(3) Phase IIB Down-selection Evaluation Criteria: The down-selection decision will be based on the Best Value to the Government. Awards may be made without discussions. Scientific/Technical Merit will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the Factor and Subfactors below. All Subfactors are of equal importance. During the Phase IIA Program Reviews, the Government team shall use the Subfactors below to assess the contractors' ability to achieve the system requirements. Additionally, a risk assessment (See Section/Paragraph V(1)(d)) will be accomplished. Results of the Government assessments shall be the decision point for down-select and exercise of the Option for Phase IIB to the winner.</p>
<p>Phase IIB Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit</p>
<p>Subfactor (1)(i) Soundness and scope of contractors' technical approach and consistency with established systems engineering practices as described in Defense Acquisition Guidebook Chapter 4 (https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=332951)</p>
<p>Subfactor (1)(ii) Extent to which the contractor demonstrates that the defined requirements (See Section I) can be accomplished with the technology being developed</p>
<p>Subfactor (1)(iii) Scope, traceability and feasibility of proposed analysis and test plans</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>(1) Award Notices for Proposals: Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award, by letter or e-mail. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award. The Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their Proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>(2) Administrative and National Policy Requirements: The offeror will require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>

<p><strong>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>(1) Clauses: As of the date of this BAA all required clauses below and in the model contract are considered current and any clauses found to be obsolete prior to contract award shall be updated.<br /><br />(2) Support Contractors: Only Government employees will evaluate the proposals for selection. AFRL has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. <br /><br />(3) Communication: Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of Proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. <br /><br />(4) Debriefings: When timely requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305 (b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016). <br /><br />(5) Wide Area Work Flow Notice: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (Mar 2008), which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/. <br /><br />(6) Item Identification and Valuation: Any contract award resulting from this announcement shall contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item such as an IPODS prototype for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html.<br /><br />(7) Forward Pricing Rate Agreements: Offerors who have forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA) should submit them with their proposal. <br /><br />(8) Pre-Award Clearance: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance is expected to pertain to this BAA.</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received by the due time and date in this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is W911W6-11-C-0015 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). Under this effort, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command intends to award a commercial contract utilizing FAR Part 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items, to acquire one hundred nineteen (119) Thermite TVC 2.0 Model 3520 computers, 30 each of part number 1090-3520-05 and 89 each of part number 1090-3520-04. The intended source for this acquisition is Quantum3D Inc., 6330 San Ignacio Ave, San Jose CA, 95119.  Anticipated delivery date is within 90 days after contract award for the first thirty (30) computers and by 1 August 2011 for the remaining eighty nine (89) computers (estimated award date 21 December 2010).  This acquisition is to procure Thermite Computers for use in conjunction with fielding the Kiowa Warrior Manned/Unmanned Level II (KW L2 MUM) System for the OH-58D and the Apache Video for UAS Interoperablity - Level 2 (VUIT-2) System for the AH-64D. The Thermite, TVC-2.0 Model 3520 computer is a critical component of both systems, and is the only  system that is compatible with the VUIT-2 and the KW L2 MUM electronics suite and currently tested with an air worthiness release for use in the electronics suite on both the AH-64D and OH-58D aircraft. Quantum3D's compatibility with the existing electronics package makes them the only source capable of providing the computers necessary in time to meet our urgent schedule. Procurement of these components on an other than a sole-source basis will jeopardize critical deployment schedules, and further degrade force protection and readiness multiplying already serious risks of personnel casualties and loss or damage to aviation assets. This combined synopsis/ solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, RMM00110018, is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 611710 and the business size maximum is $5.0 Million.    
1.  INTRODUCTION:
The Bureau of Indian Education, Division of Performance and  Accountability (BIE/DPA) serves as a state education agency (SEA) for 174 schools with academic programs serving 43,823 students that includes 6,218 students with disabilities (NASIS, 2010) located in 23 states on or near 63 American Indian reservations.  BIE/DPA requires technical assistance and special education professional services to provide BIE-funded schools professional development activities as authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) of 2004, P.L. 108-446.
2.  PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is to provide the BIE Associate Deputy Directors, Education Line Officers, school principals, and BIE-funded school staff with the most current, up-to-date information on critical issues in Special Education.  The Special Education Academy is one activity to provide the BIE and school staff at keeping abreast of critical information to meet their responsibilities under the IDEA 2004 requirements in achieving positive educational results for students with disabilities and their families.  This purpose aligns with the mission of the BIE . . . "to provide quality education opportunities from early childhood through life . . . " and is also required by IDEA 2004.  Additionally, the proposed special education professional activities do not exist within the human resource structure of the BIE/DPA special education office to fully comply with the intent of the IDEA 2004, P.L. 108-446. 
3.  BACKGROUND:
The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA, P.L. 94-142) was enacted by the United States Congress in 1975 which required public schools accepting federal funds to provide equal access to education for children with physical and mental disabilities.   Since 1975, the EHA has been revised and renamed as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) of 2004.  Today, the IDEA 2004 holds schools and States accountable and responsible for the academic achievement of students with disabilities.  Accordingly, the BIE/DPA has moved into a period of creating data systems and collecting special education data around required compliance and performance indicators.  Since the inception of the first BIE Special Education Academy in 2008, there has been tremendous interest by school general and special education staff as shown by conference evaluations.  Attendance by school staff, education line office staff, and associate deputy directors has increased by 200 from 300 to 500 over the past three years.  The anticipated attendance by school staff for the 2011 BIE Special Education Academy is 600.  The BIE, like the States, has a responsibility to implement the IDEA 2004 at the State (BIE/DPA) and school levels. 
4.  SCOPE:

Questions and Answers:  1.  One stated preference is knowledge of the hunting and fishing industry in Minnesota.  We have worked throughout the nation and are known for being able to learn and understand quickly the issues and the parties involved in focus groups, dispute resolution actions, negotiated rule making.  As environmental neutral third-party participants, we assume it is our job to get quickly up to speed on all these factors.  While we cannot state that we have intimate knowledge currently of these factors in Minnesota, we are confident of being able to learn quickly through a number of proactive measures.  I would hope that we would not be dismissed automatically because of no prior work with these parties in Minnesota.  Can you confirm this one way or the other?  Can we assume that you do NOT have one particular vendor is mind for this project?
All vendors will be evaluated per the evaluation criteria listed in the solicitation.
2.  We are investigating the University of Minnesota venue, and we assume that the estimated cost of any listening session site (and services) we find suitable at the University can be included in our proposal/response.  The wording in the solicitation does not make this clear, but we assume that this is a legitimate pass-through cost.  Comment?
The solicitation states "using the facilities found at the University of Minnesota at the Facilitators expense."
3.  Do you have an estimate (or range) of the number of people who will be invited to participate in the listening session?  Will the participants have an opportunity to review and suggest edits of comments made, prior to a final transcript being approved?
There will be no more than eight participants who will not have final transcript approval.
4. I believe that I read the solicitation to say that all services will be completed by the end of February 2011.  This works for us, but does require that a contract be announced ASAP so that work may start immediately.
It is our intent to finish the contract process as soon as possible.
5.  Although it is not mentioned, is there a desire to have a video recording of the listening session as well as an audio recording (transcribed)?  Perhaps it may be offered as an option.  In thinking about a template for use in other states and agencies, such a video recording may be easily made and could prove valuable.
We removed this option because of cost and any perceived influence it might cause the participants.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.
  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.
  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.
  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC>This Request for Proposal (RFP) is for the acquisition and implementation of a Tips, Complaints and Referrals (TCR) Triage solution for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This RFP contains a two-part source selection process. In Part One, all offeror(s) responding to Factor One, Corporate Experience, will be evaluated and a decision made on a Go / No Go basis. The assessment will be based on whether the offeror submitted an acceptable example of a previously implemented solution that clearly demonstrates corporate experience. Failure of offeror(s) to submit a Corporate Experience example during Part One will preclude further participation in this acquisition.
<p>At the concussion of this assessment, a list of qualified firms receiving a "Go" will be posted on FedBizzOps (www.fbo.gov). These offeror(s) will then be invited in writing to submit a technical and price proposal in accordance section L, Part Two instructions. All offeror(s) receiving a "No Go" will be notified by email.</p>
<p>In response to this RFP, the SEC contemplates awarding a Labor Hours, Time and Materials (TM) contract through competitive negotiated procedures. Source Selection will be conducted through the procedures outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 15 to an offeror that offers the best value to the Government in terms of price, technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet the stated Government requirement.</p>
<p>The NAICS code applicable to this project is 518210, Size standard is $23 million. This announcement constitutes the only combined synopsis/solicitation. Copies of this RFP will be available via FBO. In order to be considered for award, interested contractors must register in CCR and are responsible for printing all RFP related documents. It is the responsibility of all potential offeror(s) to monitor the FBO website for the release of any amendments or related information. All questions regarding this solicitation should be forwarded to Matthew Graham at grahamm@sec.gov</p>

<p><br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Proposed alternate designs, as long as it allows for safe loading, unloading, and transport of the M-Gator while still having room for the high pressure tanks, will be considered.<BR><BR>Custom trailer fabrications will be considered so long as the specs of the proposed trailer meet or exceed the specs listed in the SOW and that the vendor provides adequate references concerning models they have fabricated in the past. The trailer will need to be serviced locally, so it needs to be fabricated with standard, commercially available parts.<BR><BR>The fill station placement, as described in the SOW, is listed on the left side to counterbalance the weight of the additional high pressure tank on the right side of the trailer and still provide for adequate room at the nose of the trailer to allow for some equipment storage capability and workstation space. Alternate placement locations will be evaluated provided that the design maximizes usable space.

<RESPDATE>121510
<ARCHDATE>12302010
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676

<a href="mailto:steve.manley@faa.gov">steve.manley@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This announcment is amended to add a consolidated list of comments to the proposed ADS-B vehicle transponder specification.  The previous set of comments was not all inclusive.__________________________________________________
This announcement advises that FAA will hold an industry day to discuss a proposed FAA specification for manufacture of airport ADS-B vehicle transponders.  
The FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Program Office posted Announcement Number 9690 entitled "Vehicle Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) - Draft Specification and Advisory Circular" on July 2, 2010.  The announcement detailed FAA's plans to establish specification requirements for use of ADS-B equipment on airport surface vehicles, aside from aircraft, in order to mitigate safety risks on airport movement areas.    These specification requirements apply to vehicles equipped with the ability to transmit Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) messages.  The transmitted messages will be displayed on traffic displays for both air traffic control and aircraft operators who choose to equip with the ability to receive ADS-B information.   
This will not result in an FAA acquisition.  As stated in the July 2, 2010 announcement, the specification provides the basis for manufacture of the transponders.  The transponders will be qualified through FAA testing.  Airport authorities will purchase the transponders from qualified vendors.  Use of vehicle transponders at airports is not mandatory; however, airport authorities have expressed interest in vehicle transponders.  
The July 2, 2010 announcement asked industry to submit comments on the draft documents.       
The FAA has reviewed the received comments and has updated the draft specification.    This updated document is attached hereto, as well as a matrix of comments received.  
Industry input to these documents is appreciated.   
The FAA will proceed to internally coordinate the draft document.  Based on that coordination, the attached document may not be final.  
FAA will conduct an industry day in order to familiarize attendees with the vehicle ADS-B specification and the proposed FAA test approach to ensure specification compliance.  The presentation will be directed to potential vehicle transponder manufacturers; however, other interested parties may attend.  
Vendors are encouraged to submit questions no later than December 14, 2010 via E-mail to Steve.Manley@faa.gov.  The FAA will also conduct one-on-one discussions with vendors as requested.  Additional presentations may be held in the future.     
The industry day will occur on December 17, 2010 at FAA Headquarters, 800 Independence Avenue, Washington D.C. 20591 from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM in the second floor Bessie Coleman Conference room.
Interested parties are asked to contact Ms. Amy Kirkham at akirkham@regulus-group.com in order to confirm attendance.      
The July 2, 2010 announcement can be accessed at https://faaco.faa.gov/ by archive keyword "manley".   Interested parties should access this announcement for background information.   
All communications and questions shall be directed to Stephen B. Manley by E-mail at:Steve.Manley@FAA.gov.

<DESC><p>Q8. Will NGA recognize Dept of State uplifts for personnel working in a war zone?<br />A8. NGA does not use these, but as a result of competitive Source Selection, some NGA support contracts have differentials for working in a war zone.</p>
<p>Q9. Will gov't provide security for contractor personnel?<br />A9. TBD.</p>
<p>Q10. Are there special training requirements for personnel assigned overseas? Are these necessary prior to deployment?<br />A10. Specifics for this RFI requirement are TBD, but we include CENTCOM-Joint Theater Support Contracting Command (C-JTSCC) applicable clauses in all Afghanistan contracts.</p>

<p>Q16. What are you looking for in terms of the pricing catalog? Could you provide an example of what exactly is needed?<br />A16. We would like to review any published prices you have for services similar to those needed for this RFI requirement. For example, do you have GSA Schedule labor rate categories that could be proposed to meet this RFI requirement?</p>
<p>Q17. Can we use uncleared personnel for other menial tasks that do not require a security clearance?<br />A17. Specifics for this RFI requirement are TBD; NGA has had a contract where the contractor used escorted uncleared subcontractor personnel for BOSC work in CONUS. <br /><br />Q18. Will the gov't provide what positions will not require security clearances?<br />A18. TBD.</p>
<p>Q19. Will you be publishing the number of personnel and complete job descriptions required for this RFP?<br />A19. TBD, but probably not since this will most likely be a services contract with a Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>Q20. Will the contractor personnel working on this contract be housed in the same areas as the NGA personnel.<br />A20. TBD.</p>
<p>Q21. Will the contractor personnel be provided all life support activities on base? Or will the contractors need to find off-base or contract housing on Bagram?<br />A21. TBD.</p>

<DESC>To manage the overall vegetation (including, brush/slash, dead trees and understory as necessary) of designated areas in TA47 and TA48 to improve heavy, full spectrum, maneuver training accessibility and TADSS capability across the landscape. Woody species management will be accomplished by the maneuver lane thinning method or BCV habitat thinning method as described in the statement of work. All vegetation removal will either be cut or grubbed. Cut trees must not leave a stump height greater than two inches. Any ground disturbance that is deeper than three inches must be back filled.
<p>All cut/grubbed woody species (slash) and dead vegetation must be treated in one of the following ways: mulched, or stacked for burning, or removed from Ft. Hood. If mulched, pieces shall be two to four inches in width and length and the material should be spread over the landscape no thicker than a two inch layer unless mulch is used as a soil erosion BMP determined by NRCS Contracting Officer Technical Representative. If stacked for burning, all materials will be piled in 8 ft. tall, 15 ft. wide and no longer than 70 ft. All brush piles will be at least 150 ft from any identified endangered species (ES) habitat and no less than 300 ft from the installation boundary. Contractor may post and stay Ashe Juniper trees on site and may cut fire wood from Mesquite or hardwoods, except Red Oak, on site. All limbs that are cut from selected standing trees, including incidental wounds to trees, will be sealed by treating with paint or tree wound dressing spray. If any equipment is used on a diseased tree, living or dead, (as determined by NRCS personnel) the equipment must be sterilized by soaking equipment in a 20% bleach solution for at least 5 minutes and rinse with clean water before the equipment can be used on another living tree. Work will not be conducted in any DPW-NR identified ES habitat areas during nesting season. For all other birds protected by MBTA, 50% of the TA can be worked during nesting season per DPW Environmental guidelines. Period of performance for this project will be from January 24, 2011 through December 9, 2011.<br /><br />There will be a mandatory site visit for this requirement at 0900, 02 Dec 2010.&nbsp; No bids will be accepted from an entity which was not represented at the site visit.<br /><br />The Solicitation Document, Statement of Work, Terms and Conditions, and a Wage Determination have been attached and may be downloaded from this site.<br /><br />The solicitation has been amended to show separate Contract Line Item Numbers for each Training Area.&nbsp; Training Area 48 vegetation is thicker (as shown at the mandatory site visit), and is higher priority.&nbsp; Offerors must acknowledge receipt of the amendment, and submit offers using the revised bid schedule (page one of the attached "Terms and Conditions - revised" file).<br /><br />Questions from the site visit have been posted.&nbsp; If any unanswered concerns remain, please contact the contracting officer by email as soon as possible.</p>

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>SCOPE: The TSA seeks to acquire and replace approximately 79,000 computers over a 5 year ordering period with Energy Star and EPEAT compliant desktop and laptop units. Related components under this action include Thin Client laptops, Thin Client desktops and associated peripherals to be deployed at TSA Headquarters and its various field offices. A detailed list of the products required by the TSA may be found as an attachment to the original RFI.
<p><br />SET ASIDE STATUS: As stated in the Request for Information (RFI) HSTS03-10-R-CIO253 of 10/22/2010, TSA reserved the right to use all information from responses to the RFI to determine if any small business set-asides might be applicable to any resulting solicitation. Based on the Capability Statements received in response to the RFI on 11/08/2010, the TSA originally intended to designate this requirement as a 100% set-aside for qualified HUBZone small business concerns.<br /><br />Based on further research, the Small Business Administration's HUBZone regulations provide:<br />(f) A qualified HUBZone SBC may submit an offer on a HUBZone contract for supplies as a nonmanufacturer if it meets the requirements of the nonmanufacturer rule set forth at &sect; 121.406(b)(1) of this chapter, and if the small manufacturer providing the end item for the contact is also a qualified HUBZone SBC.<br />(1) There are no waivers to the nonmanufacturer rule for HUBZone contracts. <br />(i) SBA will not issue contract-specific waivers as it does for small business set-aside and 8(a) contracts under &sect; 121.406(b)(3)(i) of this chapter. <br />(ii) Class waivers issued under &sect; 121.406(b)(3)(ii) of this chapter do not apply to HUBZone contracts. <br />(2) For HUBZone contracts at or below $25,000 in total value, a qualified HUBZone SBC may supply the end item of any manufacturer, including a large business, so long as the product acquired is manufactured or produced in the United States. <br /><br />As a result, the 100% Set -Aside designation for HUBZone Small Business Concerns is hereby cancelled. <br /><br />This special notice seeks only to communicate TSA's intent to designate its Desktop Procurement now as a 100% set-aside for qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSBs). Notice of this total SDVOSB set-aside shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. <br /><br />The TSA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. TSA anticipates issuing an RFP during the later part of December 2010.<br /><br /></p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers 12/9/2010:

Question 1: ROM should this be in time or dollars?

Answer 1: The ROM should be in dollars. An estimated time and schedule to complete the effort would be beneficial as well.  


Question 2: How many users of this system are anticipated?

Answer 2: It is estimated that there will be 400 users.  

Question 3: Do standards exist already to measure the gaps against?

Answer 3: Yes, there are current standards available.  Below are examples of the standards that exist to measure gaps against.     

Gap Analysis - Access
The access gap is defined as the ability for Veterans to access the services they are in need of within a defined geographical area.  Some organizations do not apply to Access gaps; however the ones who do apply the same principle; providing needed services to Veterans in their communities.  Organization specifics are provided below.
a)	VHA - Access gap is based on the number of enrollees within the defined guidelines (drive-time to the nearest facility for a specific type of care).  The goal is not 100% access, but to target areas with limited access and large Veteran enrollees are key areas of focus.
b)	NCA - Access gap is providing the burial capabilities in existing cemeteries to meet demand and expanding to new areas (satellites or new service).
c)	VBA - Not applicable.
d)	OIT - Not applicable.
e)	Staff Offices - Not applicable.

Gap Analysis - Utilization
The utilization or workload gap is defined as the demand for services that is estimated through the future planning horizon.  The gap is identified by comparing the current workload demand to the projected need for services.  If a gap exists that can be reduced by a capital or non-capital solution, but only non-capital solutions are chosen to reduce it, include an explanation in the Strategic Capital Assessment of the possibility and effect of using non-capital solutions (e.g., telehealth, purchased care, extending business hours, etc.).  Some organizations do not have utilization or workload measures, but where measures exist, the different metrics are described below.
a)	VHA - Utilization gap is based on Bed Days of Care (BDOC) for inpatient care, Clinic Stops for outpatient care and procedures for Dental Clinic.  Projections are broken into 11 groupings (Strategic Planning Categories) and compared to base year actual workload.
b)	NCA - Not applicable.
c)	VBA - Workload is defined as the number of claims processed.
d)	OIT - Not applicable.
e)	Staff Offices - Not applicable.

Gap Analysis - Space
Space gap is defined as the amount of square footage needed (or in excess of need) to meet the demand.  The need for space has different drivers and classifications for each organization as noted below.  In cases of excess space, disposal or reuse of that space should be included as a way of addressing the gap.
a)	VHA - Space gap is identified using a full analysis of existing space, planned divestitures, and funded additions to space, compared to an ideal state of available space.  The ideal space is generated using projected workload for the FY 2019 using the Space Calculator tool.  Details of this analysis are available in supporting documentation for 2019 Space Analysis.
b)	NCA - Space gap is identified as the need for additional space due to increase in demand at a given facility, resulting in the need for committal shelters or administrative space to effectively meet the demand.
c)	VBA - Space gap is generally defined as additional space needed to support new FTE requirements.  The FTE would be used to address workload or demand gaps and require space for operation.
d)	OIT - Space gap is generally defined as additional space needed to support new FTE requirements.  In addition, OIT may have space needs due to consolidation or loss of space in existing facilities.
e)	Staff Offices - Space gap is defined as additional space needed to support new FTE requirements.

The input for the space gap is always the amount of space that is being added or removed based on the methods above.  The gap, either a space need or excess space should be addressed such that the total proposed space equals (or is within the guidelines) of the gap. Space excess should have offsetting reuse or disposal and space needs should have offsetting new space with major, minor, leasing, etc., space.
Gap Analysis - Condition
The condition gap as defined in the SAT is an estimate of dollars needed to address deficiencies at the facilities.  These deficiencies are identified via assessments and critical issues are assigned correction estimates.  The level of assessment is different for each organization as noted below.
a)	VHA - Condition gap is derived from the Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) process.
b)	NCA - Condition gap is derived from internal assessments conducted at the facilities.  Different systems are used for NCA compared to the FCA process, but the intent is the same.  In addition, NCA has information related to the Visual/National Shrine quality at the facilities that fits within the condition gap.
c)	VBA - Condition gap is derived from the Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) process.
d)	OIT - Condition gap is derived from the Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) process.  In addition, OIT has conducted an internal assessment (Facility Infrastructure Standards and Improvement or FISI) at selected sites to identify IT specific condition issues not capture as part of the FCA process.
e)	Staff Offices - Condition gap is derived from the Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) process.

The input for the condition gap is always the dollar amount (whole dollars) of deficiencies that will be addressed by the methods above.  This is not the project cost; it is only the deficiency amount being addressed.  The gap (dollar amount) should be addressed such that the total FCA amount equals (or is within the guideline) of the gap.

Gap Analysis - Energy
The Energy Gap template is designed to identify the energy goals and targets outlined in executive orders that are directly related to facility energy usage.  The energy gap is defined by the EOs, therefore all VA organizations are expected to comply with the established goals and provide a copy of the energy management plan.  
The input for the energy gap is always the dollar amount (whole dollars) that will be needed to meet the defined target/goal by the available capital program types.  As there is no specific gap for energy, only annual or future year targets to address, the total investment amount does not need to offset any specific gap.  Investment dollars should be aligned and sequenced such that the annual goals are met and any future year targets are met.
Gap Analysis - Other Gaps
The Other Gap template is used to capture legitimate gaps that do not have specific quantitative analysis to provide the exact gap to be addressed.  The following gaps are examples of gaps that could be addressed in the Other Gaps area of the SAT.  This is not intended to be a full list of all options, only a sample. 
a)	Security
b)	Privacy
c)	Parking
d)	Functional
e)	New Services
f)	Other

All gaps need to be explicitly defined in this section of the SAT, with some metric as to the size of the gap being provided.  Since this is user input, there is no specific organizational definition.  Parking gaps must be accompanied by a parking analysis.  Physical Security Assessments should serve as the starting point for security gap correction costs, however descriptions of specific deficiencies must NOT be included in this submission.  If land acquisition is the only way to meet required vehicle stand-off security requirements, it should be included as a cost in the appropriate construction program.
The input for the other gap will vary based on the user defined gap, but generally would be dollars or units being made accessible based on the methods above.  The outcome of the Other section is simply that any gap defined here, along with its metric, is addressed by the investment amount required for closing that gap.

Question 4: Section 1, question d: do you have examples of the business rules?

Answer 4: The list provided below should be considered examples only and may be subject to change.  
Business Rules: The following are examples of business rules that should be applied to the specific gap areas, in addition to the basic data validation for individual fields.
Gap Analysis - Access:

1)   If any individual field fails validation upon entry, display error message and prevent entry of that data.
2)   If the "Post Plan % Enrollees Inside Access Standards" field exceeds the defined target upper bound (variable, currently 73%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field. (VHA Only)
3)   If the "Post Plan % Enrollees Inside Access Standards" field is lower than the defined target lower bound (variable, currently 67%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field. (VHA only)

Gap Analysis - Utilization:

1)	If any individual field fails validation upon entry, display error message and prevent entry of that data.
2)	If the "Post Plan % Utilization Gap Addressed" field exceeds the defined target upper bound (variable, currently 100%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field. 
3)	If the "Post Plan % Utilization Gap Addressed" field is lower than the defined target lower bound (variable, currently 95%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field.
4)	If "Gap From Baseline" is a negative number there is no gap and no entry should be allowed in the Planned fields.

Gap Analysis - Space: 
1)	If any individual field fails validation upon entry, display error message and prevent saving of that data.
2)	If the "Post Plan % Space Gap Addressed" field exceeds the defined target upper bound (variable, currently 100%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field. 
3)	If the "Post Plan % Space Gap Addressed" field is lower than the defined target lower bound (variable, currently 95%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field.
4)	Gaps may be positive (space need) or negative (excess space), % of gap addressed should reflect % of the gap regardless of positive or negative.
5)	If any data is entered into the "Planned - Other" column, require the "Other Explanation" field to be populated before allowing to save.
6)	If "Post Plan % Space Gap Addressed" at the station level is within bounds, but individual space types are outside of those bounds, provide a warning and require the "Comments" field to be populated before saving.

Gap Analysis - Condition:
1)	If any individual field fails validation upon entry, display error message and prevent saving of that data.
2)	If the "Post Plan % Condition Gap Addressed" field exceeds the defined target upper bound (variable, currently 100%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field. 
3)	If the "Post Plan % Condition Gap Addressed" field is lower than the defined target lower bound (variable, currently 95%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field.
4)	If any data is entered into the "Planned - Other" column, require the "Other Explanation" field to be populated before allowing to save.
5)	If "Post Plan % Condition Gap Addressed" at the station level is within bounds, but individual systems are outside of those bounds, provide a warning and require the "Comments" field to be populated before saving.

Gap Analysis - Energy:
1)	If any individual field fails validation upon entry, display error message and prevent saving of that data.
2)	If any data is entered into the "Planned - Other" column, require the "Other Explanation" field to be populated before allowing to save.

Gap Analysis - Other Gaps
1)	If any individual field fails validation upon entry, display error message and prevent saving of that data.
2)	If the "Post Plan % Other Gap Addressed" field exceeds the defined target upper bound (variable, currently 100%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field. 
3)	If the "Post Plan % Other Gap Addressed" field is lower than the defined target lower bound (variable, currently 95%, but could be changed so need flexibility), provide a warning and require entry of explanation in the "Comments" field.
4)	If any data is entered into the "Planned - Other" column, require the "Other Explanation" field to be populated before allowing to save.
5)	If "Post Plan % Other Gap Addressed" at the station level is within bounds, but individual gaps are outside of those bounds, provide a warning and require the "Comments" field to be populated before saving.

Projects and Resources:
1)	Cost must not exceed project type
2)	Primary gap must exist for facility selected
3)	Gap closure must not exceed gap.  This check should be completed whenever the project is saved.
4)	In CAM view, projects cannot be approved if aggregate VISN/Market gaps are exceeded.
5)	Funding requirements must have a dollar value in at least one column, if no funding requested, return an error and require data entry before allowing saving.  
6)	For all lease projects, data must be entered in more than one cell (as leases require funding in each year throughout the lease term).
7)	Market Penetration percentage change values will be limited to between 0% and 5%.
8)	Project creator must "submit" each project for approval by the CAM.  This may either create an in-system notification or may be a mailto function which sends an automatically-generated email to the CAM to indicate that a project requires approval.
9)	Administration level approvals are required for all projects and associated Network level plans to be considered "Final".

Strategic Capital Assessment:
1)	If any field is left blank and not answered, display error message and prevent saving of that data until all entries are completed.

Question 5: Section 1, question e: can you please provide more details on what is being requested? 

Answer 5: The tool should not only provide a report of the manipulated data but also provide data identifying user access information; the average length of time spent inputting data, manipulating GAP information and other user statistics. (Possibly part of customizable ad-hoc reports from an administrator's perspective).

Question 6: Can you please tell me if this requirement is coming out of the OI&T branch of the VA in DC?  
Answer 6: The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM), is accountable for meeting a number of requirements pertaining to its capital asset management.  Capital Asset initiatives, which include the enhanced-use lease (EUL) program and Strategic Capital Investment Process (SCIP), are coordinated to ensure capital investments are based on sound business practices and principles and, most importantly, meet veterans' health care, benefits and burial needs. The requirement is coming from the Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) however it is a project being managed by the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T).

The purpose ofthe Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) and Related Systems is to provide themaintenance and operation of a voluntary, independent, confidential incident reportingprogram, and to conduct research and development using incident reports to supportimprovements in the performance and safety of the current and future domain systems. These safety reporting systems encompass aviation, railroad, and potentially otherdomains, such as medicine.  In aviation, the mission of the ASRS since 1976 has been toacquire information concerning current and potential deficiencies and discrepancies inthe operational performance of the National Airspace System and to maximize the effectiveuse of that information to further aviation safety and system planning.  The ASRS domainfunctions through an Interagency Agreement with the Department of Transportation'sFederal Aviation Administration (FAA).	A recent agreement between the Department ofTransportations Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and NASA Ames Research Center(ARC) has added the Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C3RS) to the ASRS program.  C3RS will expand the advantages of the existing ASRS confidential reporting system tothe arena of railroad safety.  The ASRS and Related Systems is managed by the HumanSystems Integration Division (Code TH) at NASA ARC, Moffett Field, CA.

<AWARDEE>Applied Biosystems LLC, 850 Lincoln Centre Dr, Foster City, CA 94404-1128 US
<DESC>A sole source blanket purchase agreement was awarded to Applied Biosystems, LLC headquartered in Foster City, CA for DNA testing supplies to operate USDA-owned, Applied Biosystems brand name Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment used for commodity testing under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).
<p>The total amount of the award is not to exceed $200,000.00 over a 5-year period of performance.</p>
<p>Justification Statement:</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), GIPSA (Grain, Inspection, Packers &amp; Stockyards Administration), TSD (Technical Services Division) Laboratory in Kansas City, MO uses the DNA testing supplies to validate real-time PCR methods and verify accuracy, precision, and reliability using publicly available methods currently used to identify transgenic events in biotechnology-derived grains and oilseeds. Also, GIPSA provides scientific expertise, engages U.S. stakeholders, and influences outcomes on issues related to testing of biotechnology-traits in grains. GIPSA facilitates grain marketing by verifying the accuracy, precision and reliability for testing of biotechnology-derived traits that are (or could be) inadvertently released into the marketplace. In the event of such a release, GIPSA must act quickly to ensure accurate testing is available in the marketplace. The GIPSA PCR testing uses Applied Biosystems brand primer/probe sets and master mix enzyme reagents that are solely available from Applied Biosystems.</p>

<DESC><BR>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, the test program in FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quotation (RFQ) number W912LP-11-Q-0009.  All proposals shall reference the RFQ number and shall be submitted by 8:00 a.m. local time on 3 November 2010. The anticipated award date is 8 November 2010. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-46 dated 29 September 2010.  This acquisition is open for Full & Open Competition. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611519 size standard of $7.0m. Contract line item numbers and quantities: CLIN 0001, Base Year (FY 11) for Basic Narcotics Investigations, 5 course iterations; CLIN 0002, CMR Reporting for Base Year (FY 11); CLIN 0003, Option Year #1 (FY 12) for Basic Narcotics Investigations, 5 course iterations; CLIN 0004, CMR Reporting for Option Year #1 (FY 12); CLIN 0005, Option Year #2 (FY 13) for Basic Narcotics Investigations, 5 course iterations; CLIN 0006, CMR Reporting for Option Year #2 (FY 13); CLIN 0007, Option Year #3 (FY 14) for Basic Narcotics Investigations, 5 course iterations; CLIN 0008, CMR Reporting for Option Year #3 (FY 14); CLIN 0009, Option Year #4 (FY 15) for Basic Narcotics Investigations, 5 course iterations; <BR>CLIN 0010, CMR Reporting for Option Year #4 (FY 15); Description of requirements for the items to be acquired:  Furnish all labor, material, supervision, and associated services to carry out the Midwest Counterdrug Training Center's (MCTC) mission requirements as defined in the Statement of Work. Vendors are invited to provide a proposal for each CLIN 0001-0010. If applicable, similarly priced courses will be combined into one SUBCLIN Item to allow the MCTC the flexibility to select the courses from within that price range. Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR).  Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government. Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered with the Government's stated importance of evaluation criteria. The Technical factors will include Course Content and Materials and Instructor Qualifications. Technical and Past Performance when combined, are significantly more important than Price. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. FAR 52.212-3 (Alt 1), Offeror's Representations and Certifications, Commercial Items (Offerors shall include a completed copy as part of their quote or a completed registration on the ORCA website (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx).

Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.

However, as a clear indicator of vendor's intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee.   Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.
