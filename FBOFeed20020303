<DESC>NA The ATEAM - Kansas Army National Guard is seeking sources for a commercially available off-the-shelf software product that provides “user friendly” performance of the aforementioned tasks.  Statement of Objective - The ATEAM - Kansas Army National Guard re manufactures turbine engines.  They are currently using a software system that does not allow everyone at the facility to access the system.  The objective this market research is to  identify commercial off-the-shelf software systems capable of allowing a ll personnel to have client software at their workstations.  The client software must access a central database, which will allow cost analysis and other standard reports to be generated.  At minimum, the database will hold the following information: order  processing (shop routings, shop floor control); material control (purchasing, shop material usage); labor hours reporting; data collection (quality control); receiving and shipping data; accounting (invoice processing, accounts payable); payroll accountin g; and barcoding capabilities.   Standard commercial practices govern most of the functions and activities on a day-to-day basis. Customer order processing activities include single and multiple sales of rebuilt end item products as well as the identificat ion and routing control of the individual components.  Order processing includes determination and application of various credits for individual components.  Order processing includes the application of cost data specific to the serial number identity of i ndividual parts.  Material control includes all warehouse-associated functions on a level that is consistent with serial number control of some parts and bulk issue point of use control of low cost consumable parts.  Material control includes functions up to but not limited to the review and forecasting report level. Labor reporting includes those human resource management functions applicable to a level that allows tracking on levels from an individual, through a department and over user specified time per iods.  Labor reporting includes the ability to track labor by task, by customer order number or definable for specific periods of time. Data collection includes those functions that allow for historical retrieval of specific control factors that may includ e serial number identification of parts, dimensional characteristics of specific parts or critical performance characteristics of parts, sub assemblies or end items. Data collection includes those functions that allow for historical retrieval of specific c ontrol factors that may include serial number identification of parts, dimensional characteristics of specific parts or critical performance characteristics of parts, sub assemblies or end items.  Access to the entire system must be through multiple comput er workstations and must be definable to individual user requirements.  FSS Contractors who have a software product that they believe will satisfy all of the requirements and more provided above, should submit detailed information on their product not late r than 20 March 2002:  Submit General Information about your firm * Company Name: * Address: * Point of Contact Telephone Number E-mail address * GSA Schedule Number *. Provide description of your Software system.   Provide three to five recent (within the  last 5 years) relevant examples of similar applications of your software and include the following information: * Name of Client using application software * Address * Point of contact Name Telephone Number E-mail address * Nature of the business using th e software system.  This is not a request for proposal.  Questions from contractor will not be addressed until after software product information and usage background information has been submitted. Please submit product information and the information req uested above to: Mr. Tom Coleman, Contracting Officer, USPFO for Kansas, 2737 S. Kansas Ave., Topeka, KS 66611-1170 or e-mail to tom.coleman@ks.ngb.army.mil.
