<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC) has a requirement to continue Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility located in Fairmont, WV. NASA GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the continued O&M support to West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC). WVRUC will continue to support; data center environment maintenance services, general facility operation and maintenance services, communication services, furniture and general office furnishings services, occupant services, library services, mail room operations, handyperson services, security services, vending machine services, document photocopy services, engineering support, planning and coordination services, executive administrative assistant, general office supply services, ADP services, training services, and network operations and maintenance services.  This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source. NASA and the West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC) in the early 1990s partnered to build the NASA IV&V Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia. By Public Law 102-139 ñ October 28, 1991, NASA provided funding to WVURC to build the building. After construction, a Memorandum of Understanding was established between NASA and the West Virginia University agreeing that WVURC would provide the building to NASA for NASAís use but would be ìresponsible for the development and daily operation of the facility.î Follow on agreements were established (cooperative agreements and contracts) between NASA and WVURC to continue to provide operation and maintenance (O&M) services to the facility for NASA. The grant stipulated that NASA would occupy the facility to perform IV&V services for the Agency.  In support of this activity, NASA awarded a contract to WVURC for the operation and maintenance of the facility in support of the NASA activities since the original occupation of the building in 1993. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of specialized services, such services may be deemed to be available from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to recovered though competition.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Nov 9, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Ryuichiro Murakami, Contract Specialist, Phone 81-42-552-1046, Fax 81-42-551-0973, Email ryuichiro.murakami.jp@yokota.af.mil - Namiko Kaneko, Contract Specialist, Phone 042-552-3010 (DSN: 225-7663), Fax 81-42-552-9846, Email namiko.kaneko.jp@yokota.af.mil
<DESC>This project is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Camp Zama, Yokota Air Force (AF) Base, and other U.S. Army and AF installations in Japan.  The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades.  Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may be as low as Y1,000,000, or may be well in excess of Y100,000,000, however most task orders will fall in the range of Y1,000,000 to Y50,000,000 (Y means Japanese currency yen).  The program value is Not-to-Exceed Y7,500,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods. The government may award as many as eight (8) contracts but anticipates awarding approximately six (6) contracts.  The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Army/Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP will identify a seed project and award of the seed project will satisfy the guaranteed minimum for the first contract awarded.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of Y500,000.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees. An actual solicitation is expected to be issued on or about 1 Nov 07.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package.  The entire solicitation, including MACC General Provision and a seed project package, will be made available only on Electronic Posting  System (EPS) single government point of entry (GPE) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package.  Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation.  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov.   


This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs. 


NOTE:     The offeror represents that it has been duly authorized to operate and to do business in the country of Japan in which the contract is to be performed IAW DFARS 252.225-7042, Authorization to Perform.  Also the Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with any host government (Japanese government) and political subdivision laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the performance of the work IAW FAR 52.236-7, Permits and Responsibilities.


A pre-bid/pre-proposal conference will be conducted at Camp Zama, Kanagawa-ken, Japan on/around 15 Nov 07 for the purpose of explaining the concepts involved in and answering questions regarding the project and solicitation.  


If there are any questions on the above information, please send them to both Mr. Ryuichiro Murakami, ryuichiro.murakami.jp@yokota.af.mil  and Ms. Namiko Kaneko, namiko.kaneko.jp@yokota.af.mil by e-mail or FAX at 042-551-0973.

<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a Sole Source commercial Basic Ordering Agreement in accordance with FAR Parts 12, 13 & 16.  This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-20, 6 Sep 07.  The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 446110 and the size standard is $6.5 M.

The government has determined US Bioservices is the only source that can satisfy this agency requirement. The requirement is to provide Carticel (autologous cultured chondrocytes), a biologic cell-based therapy indicated for the repair of symptomatic cartilage defects.  The process involves the biopsy of healthy cartilage from a patient and the culture of separated chondrocytes for 4-5weeks for subsequent implantation in the affected knee of the patient.

Carticel is the first and only biologic, cell-based therapy licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Any responsible source believing they can provide the same service, licensed and approved by the FDA, may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.   This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.     

Any company that feels they may be able to provide service that meets the needs of the Government must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) and FDA licensing to support their claim.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

Questions should be addressed to Donna Kichton, Contract Specialist, USAF Academy (719) 333-4143 or via e-mail at donna.kichton@usafa.af.mil.

As a result, \par the AGM-130/GBU-15 Data Link Sub-System [Weapon Data Links (WDL), Switchable Data Links \par (SDL), AXQ-14 Pods, ZSW-1 Pods, and all associated test sets and support equipment] must be \par modified to operate in the new frequencies approved for CONUS training use by the National \par Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  Raytheon, the OEM for the Data Link \par Sub-System, is adapting some of the data links to operate only in the new frequencies, and to be \par specifically for CONUS training use.  Raytheon will modify the rest of the Data Link Sub-System \par to operate in the new CONUS-training frequencies while continuing operation in the current training \par frequencies (now for OCONUS use) and the operational frequencies.  Boeing, the OEM for the \par AGM-130 weapon and the F-15E Air Vehicle, will advise and assure the AGM-130/GBU-15 \par Weapons System modifications meet all the requirements of the unmodified system.  The \par Government AGM-130/GBU-15 Program Office, BAE, Raytheon, and Boeing will work together \par to effect this change known as the AGM-130/GBU-15 Training Frequency Relocation (TFR).  \par \par The AN/GJM-65 Advanced Support Equipment (ASE) tester will need to be updated to test the \par data links and weapons in the new CONUS-training frequencies as well as the current \par (now OCONUS) training and operational frequencies.  The modifications to the components and \par the resulting tester will be qualified to the same use and environment specifications currently in effect \par for the AN/GJM-65 tester.  To add the new test capability to the AN/GJM-65, a new Radio \par Frequency Interface Assembly (RFIA) will be designed, qualified and produced; and the existing \par system and weapons test software will be updated.\par \par Item: 0001\par \par Description: Modification of existing AN/GJM-65 Test Set SOW 3.2 & 3.3\par Supp. Description: Not Stocklisted\par Total Line Item Qty: 2.0000 EA\par \par Destn: PLANT,,  .,00000     . \par Delivery:          , 2.00 EA \par \par PR Number(s): FD20200877081\par Item: 0002\par \par Description: Long-Lead / Obsolescence Avoidance Material SOW 3.4\par Total Line Item Qty: 1.0000 LO\par \par Destn: PLANT,,  .,00000     . \par Delivery:          , 1.00 LO \par \par PR Number(s): FD20200877081\par Item: 0003\par \par Description: Contractor Meeting/Event Support SOW 3.1\par Total Line Item Qty: 0.0000 EA\par \par Destn: PLANT,,  .,00000     . \par Delivery:          , .00 EA \par \par PR Number(s): FD20200877081\par Item: 0003AA\par \par Description: Contractor Meeting/Event Support (Modification Development) - SOW para. 3.1\par Total Line Item Qty: 0.0000 LO\par \par Destn: PLANT,,  .,00000     . \par Delivery:          , 1.00 LO \par \par PR Number(s): FD20200877081\par Item: 0003AB\par \par Description: Contractor Meeting/Event Support (Production) Reserved - SOW para 3.1\par Total Line Item Qty: 0.0000 EA\par \par Destn: PLANT,,  .,00000     . \par Delivery:          , 1.00 EA \par \par Plus 0029 additional items\par \par Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation. \par The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to \par solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of \par FAR  6.302.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for engineering and technical services for their Scientific Research and Development Squadron One (VXS-1) and their Military Support Division (MSD). Due to the complexity associated with the development of advanced technology weapon systems and the continual turn over of military personnel, NRLs MSD and VXS-1 must augment their military/civil service staff with these specialized services. This not only ensures project continuity but also provides highly qualified expertise with unique knowledge not normally found in fleet personnel. The program and engineering services afford a single Point of Contact (POC) for the NRL MSD and VXS-1 managers to assure critical communications and information are maintained between program sponsors during the requirements identification phase and throughout the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The technical services provide the expertise required for the performance of specialized design, fabrication, installation, operation, removal, and maintenance of one-of-a-kind research systems associated with VXS-1 airborne research laboratories.     Contractor services also used for NRL?s military contingent and to provide VXS-1 maintenance management assistance. The anticipated period of performance is a basic award of twelve months with four 12-month options, if exercised. The anticipated level of effort is 17,680 each for the basic contract year and Option 1, year 2, if exercised, and 17,160 for each of the additional option years, if exercised. The incumbent contractor is Eagle Systems Incorporated, at 22560 Epic Drive, California, MD 20619, Contract number N00173-03-C-2009. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. This is not a solicitation. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.
All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Description

The following procurement will be released as a set aside for 8(a) firms under NAICS 541519 with a size standard of $23 Million.

The Information Technology / Information Management (IT/IM) Department, Fleet Readiness Center East (FRC East) is responsible for managing the FRC?s IT/IM resources.  A requirement exists for the performance-based acquisition of on-site contractor support services in performing and managing IT/IM support for FRC East customers of the IT/IM Department.  The scope includes systems and applications development, maintenance and enhancement; integration of systems and applications; web development and support; database development, programming and administration; data analysis; systems administration; maintenance and support of production systems; and, general data entry required to support documentation requirements associated with tasks under this effort.

As a result of migrating much of the FRC East?s IT functions to the NMCI Contract, the FRC East IT/IM Department functions have evolved/increased due to the Legacy Transition.  There are still many legacy applications in use at the FRC East, and Contractor Support Services are required to maintain those systems until a full migration to the NMCI System is completed.  Additionally, support is required to augment the Government staff in fulfilling some of the FRC East?s NMCI responsibilities, such as tracking NMCI Seats and processing Move-Add-Changes (MACs).

The FRC East is an aviation repair facility owned and operated by the Department of Defense (DoD) and staffed by civilian employees and military personnel.  The FRC East overhauls and repairs designated airframes, engines, and components and provides field teams and manufacturing, engineering, and logistic support services.  The facility is located in Eastern North Carolina adjacent to the town of Havelock.

This procurement is being released as a set aside for 8(a) firms.  A contract with a base period and four option periods is anticipated.  The complete Solicitation will be released on or about 8 November 2007, and may be viewed at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) home page at the following web address:  http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement amendment is to answer questions that were received in response to the Request for Information, #13633 - Environmental Mitigation Monitoring - posted on 10/15/07: 1.  Is it correct to assume that the 20 page limit for submittals does not include resumes?  In other words, resumes included in an Appendix are not counted in the 20-page limit?  YES, THIS IS CORRECT. 2.  Under "Evaluation of Capability Statements" in the RFI, number (3) reads "degree of past projects to current project."  Is it correct to assume what is meant here is the "degree of similarity" of the submitter's past project experience to the current project's needs/requirements?  YES, THIS IS CORRECT. 3.  The RFI does not provide any information on what types of projects or study requests the MMS is anticipating for the new contract.  It is understood that these may be constantly changing over the term of the contract, but any information would be extremely beneficial.  NEAR TERM STUDIES THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED INCLUDE ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL PLATFORM LIGHTING EFFECTS ON BIRDS, FISH, & MARINE MAMMALS; SUBSEA WELL ABANDONMENT STUDIES IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL; DRILL MUDS & WATER COLUMN SAMPLING.  OTHER FIELD MONITORING STUDIES COULD INCLUDE ENDANGERED SPECIES DETECTION STUDIES; HIGH ENERGY SEISMIC SURVEY RELATED MONITORING TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS; BIOLOGICAL & BIOCHEMICAL PROFILING OF SHELL MOUNDS; DRILLING DISCHARGES & SEDIMENT TRANSPORT SAMPLE COLLECTION IN THE VICINITY OF HARDBOTTOM AREAS; GAS DISPERSION ISOPLETHS DIAGRAM DEVELOPMENT FOR POTENTIAL H2S RELEASES ASSOCIATED WITH PACIFIC OCS PLATFORMS.  IN ADDITION, EXPERIENCE AND ABILITY TO PERFORM TECHNICAL SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH MARINE BIOLOGY; WATER QUALITY/MARINE CHEMISTRY; AIR QUALITY; FISHERY BIOLOGY AND SEISMIC SURVEY.  4. The RFI is specifically targeting small businesses as defined by NAICS code 541620 with the annual gross revenues of less than $6.5 million.  Is there a specific target of qualified responses the MMS needs in order to proceed with keeping the solicitation as a small business set-aside?  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST BE RECEIVED FROM TWO OR MORE QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES TO PROCEED WITH A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. 5.  Based upon responses to the solicitation, assuming the MMS elects to proceed with issuing an RFP, what is the expected or anticipated release date for the RFP? LATE NOVEMBER/EARLY DECEMBER 2007. 6.  Assuming an RFP is issued, what is MMS' anticipated or hoped-for date of having a company under contract to commence work?  JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007. 7.  The RFI states "Based on the review of the responses to this Request for Information, the MMS reserves the right to issue a small business set aside or full and open competitive requirement and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR 15.202. However, please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition based on the review of the responses to this RFI".  Does this mean that the MMS can use the submitted responses to proceed to identifying possible contractors and immediately proceed to requesting those companies to submit formal proposals and participate in selection interviews?  YES, THIS IS CORRECT.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT to the original SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE NIHES2008017 posted October 16, 2007.   

The Sources Sought Notice is being changed, several questions have been answered, and the response date has been extended until November 2, 2007.

The change is to delete the following two statements - This requirement is restricted to 100% small business participation. and See Numbered Note 1.-

The Questions and Answers are as follows:

Question: The Notice states that -The Contractor shall work in concert with NTP staff scientists and contractors to provide technical writing, copy editing, proofreading, word processing, desktop publishing, graphics, file research, and record keeping services. Please define what is meant by -file research.-
Answer: To clarify the kinds of work involved in this project, the term file research could more precisely be described as reviewing laboratory reports and extracting relevant experimental information and also capturing, downloading, and reformatting files of tabular data.

Question: Please clarify number of copies and acceptable delivery methods.  The Notice states that Interested organizations should submit five (5) copies of their capability statement.... Do organizations also need to submit an original in addition to the five copies?  The Notice provides for both mail and fax as acceptable delivery methods.  Are interested organizations to fax five (or six if an original is also required) copies if they choose that method of delivery?  If only one copy is to be faxed, please consider also accepting statements via email.
Answer: None of the documents need to be coded as the original; all five may be identical copies.  If one copy is faxed and four copies are to be made then please note this on the transmittal form.  E-mail in a PDF format may be sent to sedgley@niehs.nih.gov.

Question: Please provide an address for delivery by Federal Express, UPS, or other commercial delivery services.
Answer: For commercial delivery send to: David Sedgley, Third Floor Desk, 79 T.W. Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.    

Question: Since this activity already seems to be set aside for small business, can you please clarify why you are doing this sources sought?
Answer: The activity was incorrectly identified as a small business set-aside.  The statements This requirement is restricted to 100% small business participation.  See Numbered Note 1. should not have been placed in the notice.  The purpose of this sources sought notice will be to determine whether or not this work will be restricted to some specific type of small business, all small businesses, or fully open to competition.  

Question: What does it mean when it says This is a follow-on requirement?   What does that mean for the incumbent?
Answer: There is a contract currently in place that is being re-competed.  Depending upon the outcome of this investigative effort the incumbent may or may not be eligible to compete for the follow-on replacement contract.  The existence of two or more technically capable, small businesses in several categories (Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zones, or 8(a) small businesses) could require that the competition be offered to small businesses in that category alone. 

The response date has been extended - interested organizations should now submit five (5) copies of their capability statement, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages in length, excluding standard brochures, for receipt by the agency on or before November 2, 2007.

<DESC>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), the Federal agency that oversees the AbilityOne formerly Javits-Wagner-.O Day (JWOD) Program, is seeking a commercial manufacturer of Spring Powered Staplers, to partner with a selected nonprofit agency to furnish such products to the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program. The products described must utilize the spring powered technology that allows stapling of 2?20, 2-25, and 2-60 sheets depending on model with a minimum of 70% less effort than standard commercial staplers.  The successful partner must offer a line of staplers to satisfy this light, medium, heavy duty, offering; and meet and/or exceed the FAR and other published Federal standards, including Executive Orders and applicable agency-unique requirements. To be considered for this commercial partner opportunity, the following criteria, at a minimum, must also be met:

1) Possession of a nationally-known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales and market share.  Both the SKILCRAFT brand name and the selected partner?s brand name will be boldly displayed on the product, all packaging and all collateral material.

2) The successful partner must offer a complete line of high quality spring powered staplers that satisfy at a minimum the light - 2-20 sheets, medium ? 2-25 sheets, and 2-60 sheet heavy duty staplers.  Extra consideration will be given to the manufacturer?s willingness to assist by reducing the procuring cost of any manufacturing equipment and/or component parts.  

3) Willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement, which includes on-going technical and production assistance while enabling the selected nonprofit agency to meet the suitability criteria of the AbilityOne Program in the production process by supplying component parts of the various staplers for assembly by blind employees, and providing training and instruction in the proper assembly techniques to complete the manufacturing and packaging process; thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled.

4) The chosen commercial manufacturer must be willing to commit to a high priority for delivering the bulk materials to the nonprofit agency in order to assure the agency of on-time deliveries to the end-use customers.

5) Commitment to working cooperatively with AbilityOne personnel to market the products to Government customers under the AbilityOne Program.
  (b)In determining the suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee also considers other information it deems pertinent, including comments on a proposal published in the Federal Register to add the commodity or service to the Procurement List and information submitted by Government personnel and interested persons. Because the Committee?s authority to establish fair market prices is separate from its authority to determine the suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee does not consider comments on proposed fair market prices for commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List to be pertinent to a suitability determination.

6)Willingness to work with the selected nonprofit agency, NIB or NISH and the Committee to ensure that the products? price to end-users is a fair and reasonable price.  

7)Manufacturers? submissions must demonstrate that the specific products meet the various criteria, as well as indicate what work functions the nonprofit agency?s employees would perform.  Submission should recommend ways to maximize the employment for people who are blind or severely disabled in the fulfillment of the products.

The deadline for response is November 23, 2007

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-TIRNO-RFI-PCIS

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service(IRS) is considering the implementation of the Pre-Populated Collection Information Statement(PCIS) project. The PCIS system is envisioned to be a PC-based application that will automate the search, population, calculation, and user manipulation of data received from internal & external sources in order to produce a taxpayer financial profile & financial statement for balance due cases.  PCIS will provide IRS Employees the ability to consolidate and analyze a Taxpayer?s financial information and expeditiously generate Collection Information Statements(CIS).  

The purpose of this RFI is to describe the general nature of the IRS need, the information desired of industry, and to provide instructions for submission of industry responses.   In planning for the follow-on procurement(s), the IRS is seeking innovative & cost-effective solutions that will ensure reliable performance, and increased efficiency & customer satisfaction.
At the IRS, the collection function is most closely associated with the Revenue Officer(RO) position.  Currently, the Small Business/Self Employed(SB/SE) Division has over 4,000 field ROs responsible for revenue collection.  SB/SE is leading the efforts to develop the PCIS system with buy-in and support from other parts of the IRS organization also involved in collecting unpaid taxes.  Collection of unpaid assessments can be facilitated through field or telephone contact with taxpayers or taxpayer representatives.   

PCIS will provide Collection Revenue Officers, Offer-In-Compromise(OIC) Specialists, and field Bankruptcy employees, with integrated public records, asset locator information, and other internal/external information. PCIS will provide collection employees with financial information at case assignment.  It will enable thorough initial case analysis of balance due cases sooner, enhance the quality of field contacts with taxpayers, decrease case cycle time and verify financial information.  

Collection employees should be able to:
? View and analyze the ?financial profile? & ?financial statement?
? Validate the data
? Update, or change the information
? Delete erroneous information not belonging to the taxpayer
? Add discovered information not in the system
? Associate cross-reference case information
? Receive professional license information
? Receive related business info from 3rd party sources
? Associate loans & mortgages to valued properties & see equities
? ID the present market value on real property
? ID Kelly Blue book values on vehicles going back 3 years
? Receive cases through batch processing or request specific case pulls
? Formulate probing questions due to advanced preparation & review of the info gained from PCIS.
? Receive Tax Delinquent Account(TDA)/Tax Delinquent Investigation(TDI) addresses going back 10 years 
? Possible pre-populate Financial Statements 433A, and 433B.

We appreciate your response; it will be used solely by the IRS as market research.  We will not divulge individual responses to the RFI outside of the IRS team.  Please provide points of contact, including name, address, phone/fax number(s) and e-mail.

Responses must be submitted to Tanya M. Conner within 10 calendar days after issuance of the RFI.  Clarification questions in response to the RFI and final responses to the RFI may be emailed to Tanya.M.Conner@irs.gov  on or before 2:00 PM (EST) October 30, 2007.  No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.                
  
Summary of Project Goals:
In 2004, SB/SE Collection Cycle Time Teams determined that ROs expend significant time and resources in securing financial statement data.   The process for gathering financial data includes a combination of manual records searches, internal and external data base searches involving multiple logins and passwords, and requesting information from the taxpayer or taxpayer rep.  PCIS may be developed on its own server to be accessed by desktop & laptop computers which operate in a Windows-based Personal Computer(PC) system.  It will interface to internal IRS systems and external data sources.  The PCIS application will consist of functionality that will allow ROs and other IRS collection employees to view and edit information imported into the financial profile and financial information statement that are received at case assignment and cases can be manually input for overnight batch processing on related entities and in Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (TFRP) cases where we are trying to determine collectability before making an assessment.  PCIS will allow the Collection employees to add additional information and to perform comprehensive analysis of Taxpayer?s financial information as well as automate the population and generation of an information statement Form 433-A and the Form 433-B or at least generate/print a form with corresponding information.  Form 433A and Form 433B may be viewed at www.irs.gov.  

Currently all Collection employees must use a variety of internal and external systems on specific cases to verify the financial condition of the taxpayer, as prescribed by Internal Revenue Manual requirements.  Following case assignment, SBSE Collection Field Revenue Officers and other collection employees conduct multiple searches to obtain financial information and access various IRS systems.   This includes gaining access to host of financial data including the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS), the Integrated Collection System (ICS), the Cash Transaction Register (CTR), ChoicePoint/Accurint, Credit Bureau, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), Kelly Blue Book, Federal and State Tax Tables, Allowable Expense Tables, and Real Estate Comparables.  For searches performed electronically multiple logins and passwords are involved.

PCIS is a PC based application that will interface with 4 other system applications currently in production including Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS)/Master File (MF), United States Postal Service (USPS) Address Information System, ICS, and AOIC.  PCIS will align to the IRS Enterprise Architecture model and the business-driven approach recommended for federal IT projects.  The Contractor shall develop an interface between the PCIS system and 5 other system applications currently in production including IDRS/MF, USPS Address Information System (AIS), ICS, and AOIC.  It will interface with external taxpayer and taxpayer asset locator systems as Kelly Blue Book, ChoicePoint, Data Matrix System (DMS), Secretary of State, and other public record data.  The PCIS system will go beyond the mere population of data into information statements by formulating a taxpayer financial profile.  PCIS will contain decision-making capabilities to value and distinguish between internal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) based data and non-TIN based data.  

The IRS is developing 2 very similar documents called:  Detailed Requirements for the IRS Pre-Populated Collection Information Statement (PCIS) for Form 433-A, Collection Information Statement for Individuals; and Detailed Requirements for the IRS Pre-Populated Collection Information Statement (PCIS) for Form 433-B, Collection Information Statement for Businesses available at www.irs.gov      

The Register User Portal (RUP) already performs XML scanning from within the 2nd firewall. With an RUP solution, the external trading partner, a registered RUP user, would use 'https', SOAP headers, and imbedded XML. Two Java Servletts would have to be written to run on a server between the 2nd and 3rd firewall. One Servlett for incoming traffic and one for outgoing traffic. The incoming Servlet would take the data coming from the trading partner, wrap it appropriately to get the data through the 3rd firewall, and deposit the data in an appropriate incoming directory on a server behind the firewall. The outgoing Servlet when invoked would query the outgoing directory on the server with an appropriately wrapped message sent through the 3rd firewall. If there is an outgoing file available, the Servlet would retrieve the file and pass it to the trading partner. For PCIS the trading partner would have to 'poll' for files to be processed. PCIS will have the files available around 8:00 P.M. Sun - Fri. The trading partner would establish an authenticated session through the RUP every 15 mins until the PCIS file was detected and downloaded. When the trading partner has finished processing the PCIS requests, a session would be established with the RUP and the response file would be uploaded.   The RUP solution was proposed by IRS Enterprise Architecture.  The solution is being evaluated to determine if this potential solution is an appropriate approach to obtaining TIN bases (credit bureau) and non-TIN based (such as Accurint, ChoicePoint, Lexis Nexus, Secretary of State, or other 3rd party provider) information.  

The PCIS project will be managed using accepted project management practices implemented within the IRS Enterprise Life Cycle(ELC) methodologies.  Detailed information about these processes is available on the ELC Web page at http://bsm.web.irs.gov/ELCweb/. Associated deliverable documents may be required of the vendor to achieve compliance with ELC guidelines.

Requirements have not yet been finalized, but may include the following categories in the RFP:  Architecture, Infrastructure, Functional, Non-Functional, Security and Training.

As a U.S. Government entity, the IRS and its technology systems are required to conform with federal guidelines, where applicable.  Examples include, but are not limited to:  The Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98), Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. ?794d), E-Government Act of 2002, Interagency Committee of Government Information (ICGI) recommendations, U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Statutes.

The IRS business outcomes or desired end-results are based on IRS goals and objectives, as well as being driven by government directives.  The IRS has identified 3 core business outcomes that map directly to the goals and objectives laid out in the IRS Strategic Plan:  2005-2009:
1. Improve Taxpayer Service leading to increased customer satisfaction.
2. Enhance Enforcement of Tax Laws leading to increased voluntary compliance.
3. Modernize the IRS through its People, Processes and Technology leading to increased efficiency through technology utilization and responsiveness.

The IRS is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider when determining its acquisition strategy and development of the Request for Proposal (RFP):
1. How many years of experience does your firm have performing IT development as described in this RFI?
2. What type of web portal services does your organization currently provide?
3. Have you performed any web portal managed services tasks for the Federal Government or for State Governments? If yes, please explain.
4. The IRS has extremely high security and privacy concerns.  Preventing disclosure of privacy data (e.g., tax account data) is a major factor in any IRS application design.

<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Astoria-Pacific International for a Service Contract on the existing Astoria Flow Analyzer and FASPac operating system. The Government intends to award a contract for a base period of one year and two option years, to include travel and expenses, renewed annually.

Mission:  TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

Nature and Description of Action:  The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau?s Lab has previously acquired the Astoria lab instrument, and now has a requirement for post-warranty service. This service is critical to the mission, as there is a need for uninterrupted use and operation of this analyzer and operating system.

A sole source to Astoria-Pacific is intended for this order, based on the fact that they are the manufacturer of the equipment and supplier of parts.  No other known source has these capabilities.

No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than three days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Astoria-Pacific.  If you would like a copy of the Sole Source Justification, please fax or e-mail your request.

The description of the item is as follows:  The MK 84 MOD 10 IM Kit consists of one base plug assembly, a shipping cap, and two fuze liners.  The base plug consists of one 14' diameter 2.5' thick ASTM A633, Grade E steel plug.  The Plug has a threaded inner and outer diameter as well as six kidney s haped thru holes.  Two pieces fasten to the plug with SAE-AMS-S-8802 adhesive and four drive studs.  One piece of the plug assembly is an 11' diameter .400 inch thick piece of ASTM D4673 Acrolonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) Terpolymer. The final piece of the assembly is a 11.3' diameter .4' thick ASTM A519 steel doughnut shape.  All three parts of the plug assembly would require assembly.  The shipping cap is .110 min thickness ASTM A621 or A622 steel, generally rolled, into a 18' diameter, 4.5' long cylin der with a 3' lip on one end.

<SUBJECT>61 -- Alernating Current (AC) Photovoltaic (PV) Building Block
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking partnership relationships, consisting of a combined license with funds-in CRADA agreements with third parties to enable further development of  Alternating Current (AC) Photovoltaic (PV)  Building Block technology as described in US patent # 6750391.  The successful partner will have demonstrated ability in developing and bringing to market photovoltaic assemblies and systems.

The Alternating Current (AC) Photovoltaic (PV) Building Block or the AC PV Building Block is a fully integrated photovoltaic package that can be used as a photovoltaic power source that has only ac power out.  It can be used in or as single AC PV Building Block modules and/or as arrays.  It is constructed such that the assembly combines, contains and integrates all of the electrical and mechanical elements of a photovoltaic array and provides the required protection for the distributed ac conductors of the system.  It eliminates all of the dc voltage concerns of today?s photovoltaic systems by containing the dc within the AC PV building block structures.  And then within the same structures it provides conversion of the dc power produced by the photovoltaic module to ac power that is fully compatible with ac utility grids, mini-grids or small stand-alone and hybrid power as required by the application.  It is compatible with all known photovoltaic module technologies and photovoltaic module designs.  Concentrator PV modules using generally low concentration are also compatible.  The AC PV Building Block offers an excellent method for listing and certifying complete PV systems and provides a truly plug-n-play option for installing PV systems.

<SUBJECT>D--National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS)
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS).  This non-competitive action is being issued by the Department of the Interior - National Business Center on behalf of the Office of Law Enforcement, Security, and Emergency Management. This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition.  The Government has a requirement for continued secure telecommunication system usage of the NLETS secure system. NLETS provides, within a secure environment, an international justice telecommunications capability and information services that benefit the safety, security, and preservation of human life and the protection of property to the highest degree.  NLETS assists national and international governmental agencies that enforce or aid in enforcing local, state, or international laws or ordinances.  It is the pre-eminent interstate law enforcement network in the nation for the exchange of law enforcement and related justice information NLETS provides two basic capabilities to users.  It is an international computer-based message-switching system that links together state, local, and federal law enforcement and justice agencies for the purpose of information exchange.  It also provides information services support for a growing need for justice-related applications.  NLETS supports data communications links to state networks using a commercial frame relay service.  All federal agencies with a justice component use this interface, and the Department of the Interior needs to maintain compatibility for communication.  An interruption in service or additional cost in transitioning to a new vendor would be severely detrimental to the Government.   The period of performance for this effort is for one year from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by October 30, 2007. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  The NAICS Code is 511210.  It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Critical Path, Inc., P.O. Box 200148, Department 014802, Dallas, Texas 75320-0148, for a renewal of Critical Path? Directory Server and Meta-Directory Server software licenses and maintenance support for a 12-month Base Period and two successive 12-month Option Periods.  Critical Path software and support has provided the core services for the NIH Employee Directory (NED) since 2000.  The software allows CIT engineers to build connections between NED and disparate sources with discrete data about people. These connections allow NED to consolidate the people data into a single authoritative data set in NED. The NED system is then used by many downstream NIH systems as their source for authoritative people information. NIH has a significant investment in the Critical Path software. There are no other vendors who have the necessary expertise to support this product or its implementation at NIH.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software product and support specifications which will be considered by the agency.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a software product that can fulfill all of the NED software requirements.  Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award.  Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at:  http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.  Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.   NLM Synopsis No. 08-014-MJK shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO:  Maxwell Kimpson at kimpsonm@mail.nlm.nih.gov.  Inquiries regarding this notice may be made to Maxwell Kimpson, (301) 496 6546; Fax 301 402-0642.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)
Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
		High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
		Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
		Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required; 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required; and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.    

b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.  

52.233-2  SERVICE OF PROTEST (AUG 1996)

An on-the-job list of tasks that must be completed by each pre-commissioned employee is maintained by the employee and his/her supervisor.  We can provide a sample of this check list.  Note:  The pre-commission training program consists of a series of classes and on-the-job tasks that takes approximately 3 to 5 years to complete before employees are allowed to sit for the Commissioning Test. 

4.	Will some observation of ongoing training be possible?
Yes, if it is determined desirable by the contractor and FCA.

<DESC>Amendment 2 - to include additional questions/answers.  No more questions will be accepted.

1.  What issues are driving the FCA to make this assessment now? What challenges does the FCA hope the consulting engagement will overcome?
The Commission Test and training programs leading to the test have not undergone a major review since the inception of the test in the late 1980's.  No particular challenges; however, we would like the FCA Commissioning Test benchmarked against the testing the other Financial Regulators conduct. 

2.  Will the contractor be limited to a review of the written documentation or may they meet with examiners/trainers or watch them lead courses? 
Yes, we anticipate meetings.  FCA's headquarters is in McLean, VA and we have four field locations (Bloomington, MN, Dallas, TX, Denver, CO, and Sacramento, CA).  Most of the examiners (pre- and post) are located in the field locations.   

3.  Will the contractor be visiting sites and/or meeting with trainees/trainers anywhere but in McLean?
See Question number 12 on first amendment.

4.  What is the estimated volume of written documentation to be reviewed?
There are approximately 10 pre-commissioning training programs ranging in length from 2 to 4 days each.  There are 4 career tracks for post-commissioned examiners.  The Pre-Commission Test combines multiple choice questions (written test) and simulations (oral test) which takes approximately 3 days in total.  An overview of the structure of the training programs and test is what is requested in this contract - it is not the specific content of the courses.  For example, length of time it takes to eligible to sit for the test, the methods of training employees (e.g. mentors, classroom training versus blended learning, etc.).  

5.  Will the contractor have access to Subject Matter Experts, evaluators/trainers, and learners at each level (for focus groups and/or surveys)?
See question number 13 on first amendment.

6.  What kind of support can the agency provide to enable the contractor to quickly and cost-effectively conduct web surveys of various learner groups/stakeholders?
The FCA IT staff can work with the contractor to set up and deliver a web based survey if it is determined by the contractor and FCA that this is needed. 

7.  Please confirm that the final report needs to be delivered to the FCA within 60 days of award of contract.
See question number 11 on first amendment.

         (a) Prohibitions. 
          Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
         (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
         Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
         Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
         Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
         (1)     The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
         (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 
         (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
         (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
         (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
         Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
         (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
         (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
         (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
         (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
         (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
         (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
         (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
         (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
         (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
         (i) Warrants; 
         (ii) Options; 
         (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
         (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
         (v) Others similar interests. 
         (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.
