<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is the Federal agency charged with improving the quality and availability of prevention, treatment, and rehabilitative services in order to reduce illness, death, disability, and cost to society resulting from substance abuse and mental illnesses.  SAMHSA focuses attention, programs, and funding on promoting a life in the community with jobs, homes, and meaningful relationships with family and friends for people with or at risk for mental or substance abuse disorders.   The SAMHSA vision is achieved through an action-oriented, measurable mission of building resilience and facilitating recovery.  

To ensure that SAMHSA’s customers receive the most effective, comprehensive, and cost-efficient information service, SAMHSA has realigned its health information dissemination efforts into a single contract.  In the new contract, both the NCADI and NMHIC identities will be retained.  Both SAMHSA’s NCADI and its NMHIC are highly utilized resources within the substance abuse and mental health fields.  

SAMHSA’s NCADI is the hub of the Federal Government's effort to gather and communicate information about effective prevention, intervention, and treatment policies, programs, and practices as well as an important link to scientific research on substance abuse and mental health issues.  As such, NCADI provides a single point of entry to comprehensive, customer-oriented information services for SAMHSA’s current constituents as well as new audiences.  SAMHSA’s NMHIC is the first point of contact for any U.S. citizen seeking help for a mental health problem from the Federal Government.  NMHIC was established to serve the information and referral needs of users of mental health services and their families, service providers, policy makers, the media, and the general public.  NMHIC will provide information dissemination support to SAMHSA/CMHS programs including: the Emergency Services and Disaster Relief Program, the National Public Information/Education Campaign on Children's Mental Health Services, and the School Violence Prevention Program.

Administered by SAMHSA’s CSAP and CMHS, SAMHSA’s Health Information Network contract will provide prompt, customer-friendly, and cost-effective information services using easily understandable and accessible formats, via a wide range of communication channels, to reach all segments of society.  To achieve the contract’s objectives, the contractor must have a strong and culturally competent management structure (from senior to line managers) as well as be knowledgeable of the complex issues in the mental health and mental illness, substance abuse prevention, intervention, and treatment field, proficient in knowledge dissemination/health communications/ marketing/evaluation strategies, experienced in building collaborative relationships to leverage resources, highly skilled in the use of information technologies for dissemination, skilled in quality assurance implementation,  and proficient in modern warehouse/cost recovery operations.  

The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 516110. This solicitation is Small Business Set-Aside.  The estimated date for issuance of RFP No. 277-04-6091 is scheduled for release approximately November 07, 2003, and proposals are due in the Contracts Office 45 calendar days thereafter.

<DESC>The Government intends to conduct sole-source negotiations for privatizing the electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater utility distribution systems at Peterson Air Force Base (AFB), Colorado. The intended contract awardee is Colorado Springs Utilities. Colorado Springs Utilities, an entity of the City of Colorado Springs, has a sixty-year history of providing certain utility services to Peterson AFB. The decision to award on a sole-source basis was based on following facts: (1) The Government leases part of the land comprising Peterson AFB from the City of Colorado Springs. (2) The City of Colorado Springs owns a significant portion of the land housing the pipes and wires of the utility distribution systems. Consequently, the Federal Government does not possess uncontroverted authority to grant Rights of Way or easements for purposes of accessing the utility distribution systems. (3) The components of the distribution systems have been housed in such a way, over the sixty-year period, that Federal Government and City of Colorado Springs ownership are, to a significant degree, inseparable or indistinguishable. The contract will be awarded for up to fifty years. The contract will be for the operation and maintenance (O & M) of the electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater utility distribution systems. Access will be granted through execution of Right of Ways, and transfers of title will occur through the execution of Bills of Sale. The O & M contract will be governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The transfers of property and grants of access are authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 2688.  Colorado Springs Utilities will be required to comply with all service distribution requirements outlined in the solicitation, to obtain all applicable permits, licenses and certifications necessary for performance, to possess the financial resources necessary to provide operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems, and to possess the financial resources required for capital improvements. The Point of Contact is SSgt Marcus Webb, Contracting Specialist, Phone: (719) 556-4999, Fax: (719) 554-2744, e-mail: marcus.webb@peterson.af.mil

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command is issuing a solicitation for the procurement of SOF Combat Assault Rifles (SCAR).   The program will use full and open competition to fulfill the joint USSOCOM SCAR requirement.  The SCAR will be developed in two threshold configurations, a SCAR-Light (SCAR-L, 5.56x45mm) and a SCAR-Heavy (SCAR-H, 7.62x51mm) with the SCAR-L being the priority.  Both the SCAR-L and H will possess the capability for barrel modularity and thus will be available in the following variants:  Standard (S), Close Quarters Combat (CQC) and Sniper Variant (SV).  The SV can be a modular enhancement or a separate weapon.  The barrel modularity can be accomplished via complete upper receiver changes or just the barrel.  The SCAR-L shall be optimized for 5.56x45mm and thus shall use an enhanced 5.56mm magazine.  The SCAR-H will provide an “open architecture” design to accommodate changing calibers from the standard 7.62x51mm.  The initial caliber change is projected as the 7.62x39mm.  The ergonomic and parts commonality between the SCAR-L and H shall be maximized to create a “family” of SCAR weapons.  This commonality is essential for training time reduction, enhancing mission effectiveness, and improving the SOF operator’s ingrained operational and emergency procedure autonomic responses that are critical during high stress situations.  The SCAR system will be rugged, highly reliable, controllable in full automatic fire, have no unsafe failure modes, be highly ergonomic, corrosion proof (objective)/resistant (threshold), capable of lube-less firing (objective)/minimal lube firing (threshold), and capable of being operated and maintained by a single man.   

The SCAR-L with stock collapsed or folded shall not exceed lengths of 29.9”/33.6” extended with standard barrel.  The SCAR-L shall weigh no more than 7.25 lbs unloaded.  The SCAR-H shall be collapsible or foldable to lengths not greater than similar configurations of currently available 7.62mm battle rifles (30.3” folded/40.2” extended with standard barrel).  The SCAR-H shall weigh no more than 9 lbs. 

The following are the Key Performance Parameters for the SCAR:  Adaptability, Modular/Family of Weapons, Reliability and Accuracy.

The SCAR barrels/caliber will be readily exchanged at operator level, without head space/timing adjustments, within 20 minutes, threshold (T), 5 minutes objective (O).  

The SCAR-L and H, in threshold caliber configurations (5.56mm NATO and 7.62mm NATO) with M855 and M80 ball ammunition respectively (T), spirally developed/alternate caliber configurations (O), shall have a Mean Round Between Stoppages (MRBS) of 2,000 rounds (T), 8,000 rounds (O).   

The SCAR-L and H, in threshold caliber configurations (T), spirally developed/ alternate caliber configurations (O), shall have a Mean Round Between Failure (MRBF) of 15,000 rounds (T), 35,000 rounds (O). 

The SCAR-L and H, in threshold caliber configuration/ball ammunition (T), spirally developed/alternate caliber configurations (O), will have a fully functional service life without overhaul for a minimum of 15,000 rounds (T), 90,000 rounds (O) for the weapon and 15,000 rounds (T), 35,000 rounds (O) for the barrel.

The SCAR, in threshold configuration (T) and all caliber/barrel configurations (O), will not add more than 1.0 MOA at 300 meters (T), .25 MOA at 300 meters (O) to baseline (M855, MK262, M80, M118) ammunition performance

The SCAR shall also be compatible with the SOPMOD Accessory Kit components via MIL-STD 1913 rails.  It is envisioned that the SCAR weapons will be available with a sling, bipod, forward handgrip, blank firing capability and an operator’s manual.

Offerors will be required to provide product sample SCAR-Ls as part of the proposal.  The product samples will consist of 3 each SCAR-L rifles with standard barrels, 1 each CQC conversion and a SCAR-H technical approach.  After evaluation, the government will have the flexibility to award “multiple” contracts for follow-on test/evaluation quantities.  The contract type will be an eight-year, Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum quantity is projected to be 12 each SCAR-L Engineering Test Units with standard length barrels, 6 SCAR-L CQC conversions, 1 each SCAR-L Sniper Variant and 1 each SCAR-H standard.  The government will conduct an evaluation of the test units that may result in subsequent delivery orders for the SCAR family of weapons.  The contract(s) minimum quantities are delineated above.  The contract(s) maximums are 84,000 SCAR-L Standard; 28,000 SCAR-L CQC conversions; 12,000 SCAR-L SV; 15,000 SCAR-H Standard; 7,000 SCAR-H CQC conversions; and 12,000 SCAR-H SV.  The contract will contain a Provisioning Item Order (PIO) contract line item number (CLIN) of $10,000,000 for both the SCAR-L and SCAR-H.  The contract will also contain a CLIN for Engineering Services for product improvement/caliber modularity development for a not to exceed amount of $4,000,000.  The contract will also contain CLINs for magazines and tool and gage kits for both the SCAR-L and SCAR-H.  The contract will also have provisions for ordering technical data.  The contract is F.O.B. Destination (NAVSEA Crane - Crane IN).  For the minimum quantities delineated above the delivery is required 180 days after order.  Subsequent deliveries of the SCAR-L will require deliveries to commence 90 days after order.  The delivery schedule for the SCAR-H is 180 days after order for the first deliveries and once in production will be 90 days after order.  The ordering parameters (quantities) for all SCAR variants and magazines are a minimum quantity of 10/ea and a maximum quantity of 20,000/ea. The maximum monthly delivery rate is 2,000/ea for the SCAR L weapon type and 500 per month for the SCAR H weapon type.  The solicitation will require delivery of 3/ea SCAR-L (5.56x45mm) product samples; 1/ea SCAR-L CQC conversion and a SCAR-H approach included in the concise technical proposal by the closing date of the proposal.  The solicitation will be evaluated on a best value basis and the Government will reserve the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror and other than the highest technically rated offeror.  The SCAR L product samples are not required to meet the specification in its entirety.  The technical proposal shall address any differences between the product samples and the production units; must address any known deficiencies where the product samples do not meet the specification; and shall have a separate section addressing the vendor’s SCAR-H approach.  The Government cannot guarantee the condition of the product samples after testing.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  All offerors are responsible for monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizopps.gov/ for release of the upcoming solicitation and any notices.  Any questions may be directed in writing, to the following: pfender_j@crane.navy.mil or via facsimile to the attention of Mr. John Pfender at (812) 854-5198.

<DESC>Within the next few months the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. ("AURA") is planning to release three Requests For Proposals (RFPs). This announcement covers  all three RFPs so that Vendors can plan and coordinate their response(s) to one or more RFPs.

(1) RFP No. N231397 to be released early November 2003, will seek qualified vendors and research institutes to perform research and development programs to develop and/or demonstrate key components of laser technologies appropriate for astronomical laser guide star adaptive optics.

(2) RFP No. N231398 to be released early January 2004, will seek a qualified vendor to develop and provide a laser system to be used as part of an adaptive optics (AO) system for the Keck I telescope of the Keck Observatory, a 10 meter optical/infrared telescope located on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

(3) RFP No. N231399 to be released late February 2004, will seek a qualified vendor to develop and provide a laser system to be used as part of a multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) system for the Gemini South Observatory, an 8 meter optical/infrared telescope located on the summit of Cerro Pachón, Chile.

In advance of releasing the second and third RFPS AURA will be seeking comments from potential vendors on the proposed requirements for the Keck I and Gemini South Laser Systems.

All three RFPs are concerned with sodium laser systems for use with laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) in astronomy.  Adaptive optics (AO) systems remove distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence by making corrections to the incoming wavefront using one or multiple light sources as references.  These reference sources can be bright stars, or artificial light sources created by shooting one or multiple lasers at the sky. In particular, 589nm lasers can be used to excite mesospheric sodium atoms located 90 kilometers above the ground.  Laser systems used for sodium LGS AO must be precisely tuned to the sodium D2 line near 589nm and be unusually powerful for lasers at this wavelength.  Depending on the application and site, the output power requirements for sodium lasers on existing 4-10m telescopes range between 10-20W for use with single-LGS conventional adaptive optics systems to more than 50W for use with five-LGS Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems (power and pulse format requirements for proposed 30-100m telescopes are discussed in the full text version of this announcement).  The sodium D2 line comprises two absorption peaks, D2a (the stronger of the two) and D2b, separated by 1.77GHz, and the line is Doppler-broadened to a total width of 3 GHz.  Lasers should ideally be tuned to the D2a absorption line, and their bandwidth should not exceed 3GHz in any case.

The three RFPs will be administered for the National Science Foundation (NSF) Astronomy Division by AURA through the Gemini Observatory.  The first and second RFPs will be administered in partnership with the Keck Observatory, Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in accordance with the objectives set forth in a Gemini/Keck/CfAO/AFRL joint proposal to the National Science Foundation submitted in November 2000.

This is an extremely abridged version of this announcement of opportunity.  Interested parties should download the full text at http://ftp.gemini.edu/Groups/AO/Announcements  or contact Andy Flach (Tel: 520-318-8410; Fax: 520-318-8590; email: aflach@gemini.edu) to receive the full announcement of opportunity by email or fax.

<DESC>Solicitation for Construction Services to retrofit the HVAC system for the prisoner holding and transfer areas at the U.S. Courthouse, 5400 Federal Plaza, Hammond, Indiana, to ensure that the airborne pathogens are not allowed to infiltrate the air systems serving the rest of the courthouse.  The existing system will be modified to provide a closed HVAC system for the prisoner areas that utilizes 100% outside air for supply, conditions and circulates the air within the space and exhausts all of it to the outside through HEPA filters.  At the transfer corridor on the lower level and holding areas on the second, third, and fourth levels, ductwork will be reworked and existing VAV boxes or air handling units will provide supply air.  Reworked duct, together with new exhaust fans with HEPA filters, will exhaust the air.  Existing mechanical, electrical and plumbing elements will be relocated, if required, to install the new ductwork.  
The work will be performed largely off hours and coordinated to minimize the impact on the prisoner holding and transfer associated with the courthouse operation.  Funds are not currently available for this acquisition.  A firm, fixed-price contract is contemplated.  Contractor selection will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for Source Selection procedures and the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Proposal process.  Offerors will submit price proposals and technical proposals in separate envelopes.  The technical proposals will be reviewed first for compliance with the Go/No-Go factors based on experience with similar projects, acceptable references and company/key personnel qualifications.  Only the price proposals from offerors that meet these technical requirements will be opened and evaluated.  
The intention is to make award to the LPTA, responsible offeror.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is determined to be in its best interest to do so.  This procurement for Building Alterations falls under NAICS code 236220.
It is open to both large and small businesses.  The small business size standard for this work category is $28.5 million.  “Although this procurement is open to large businesses,” small, small woman-owned, small minority-owned, small HUBZone, small Veteran-Owned, and service disabled Veteran-Owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate.  Large business will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small woman-owned.  
HUBZone small, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and Veteran-Owned Small business
And service disabled Veteran-Owned business concerns through participation as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  As part of the technical package,

<DESC>Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is planning to issue a sole-source contract to enable the OPM to obtain assistance from Mr. Thomas E. Thompson, Jr. in support of the Agency’s efforts to manage and improve the operation of its real property program, particularly in matters relating to GSA leased space and related Agency billing. The OPM intends to award a 12-month service contract to Mr. Thompson.

Mr. Thompson possesses unique experience and expertise derived from his close working relationship with GSA and OPM in its space management program: including, in-depth understanding of GSA leasing and costing practices which determine billing charges for individual sites, in-depth understanding of GSA lease documents and language, in-depth knowledge of OPM headquarters and field organizations, and in-depth knowledge of OPM's internal financial systems resulting from developing the current financial reporting systems used by OPM to distribute GSA leased space charges to Agency cost centers. Among other services, Mr. Thompson will help identify and reconcile errors, changes, and other deviations in monthly billings, and prepare a report for the Agency CFO distributing the GSA bill across OPM organizations and cost centers.  Mr. Thompson will train Agency personnel in the operation of the reconciliation and cost distribution process and systems as personnel are hired.

Mr. Thompson is the only known source to provide the services required by the Agency with in-depth knowledge of the GSA leasing program and Agency unique cost distribution procedures and systems software. OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price contract on other than a full and open competitive basis. Only one responsible source is available and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Agency. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 

Interested parties having all the capabilities to perform the services described above are requested to submit capability statements, limited to not more than 10 pages, to be received within 15 days of publication of this Notice to: U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Contracting, Facilities, and Administrative Services Group (CFAS), 1900 E Street NW, Washington, DC 20415.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Mathew A. Ridolfi Contract Specialist 7037871813     Mathew.Ridolfi@mms.gov;
<DESC>1.	Is there a specific or standard format for the Capabilities Statement which must be submitted? No.  Please refer to the Notice for the elements to be addressed. 2.	Is there a page limit, or recommended length, to the capabilities statement and/or supporting documentation?   Yes. The capabilities statement should not exceed 25 pages, including brief resumes of key personnel and supporting documents.   3.	No page limit is apparent in the announcement.  Is there an expectation regarding the length (in pages)  of this Capabilities Statement to be submitted on October 22?  Can we also include samples of our work?   See answer to # 2 above. Samples may be provided. Samples, including physical samples or URLs to work products, should not exceed 3 pages in length, which is included in the 25 page limit. 4.	Do you have an example of a previous "capabilities statement" so that we have a sense of format?    No, a sample will not be provided. Please see the answers to questions 1-3  for guidance concerning the content of the capabilities statement. 5.	Regarding the ODPHP's interest in identifying a contractor to support them in research and evaluation activities related to consumer health information about prevention, we have a question.  Would the successful offeror be restricted from any future work involving the information gathered as part of this contract such as but not limited to developing web sites to share that information with the public?   The successful offerer will not be restricted from competing for any possible follow-on contracts related to this project.   Since the contract involves audience research, use of the actual information gathered would be restricted subject to federal law. 6.	Do you have any guidance on the size of the contract in terms of dollars?  I did see the 9,200 hours and 18 months, but we're not sure what would be available besides staff time?   The level of effort represents an approximation of the total resources, including all costs, available for this project. 7.	Along those lines, would the scope of this contract involve resources for some sort of expert panel to provide input (especially in Tasks 2 & 7)?   Yes, this approach would be acceptable, but no additional funds would be available. 8.	Do you expect that the lit review & synthesis will include a quantitative meta-analysis or would the review basically focus on qualitative analysis?   A quantative meta-analyis is not a requirement, but offerors are free to propose one if warranted. 9.	Is Task 2 designed to be something of an end goal in itself or would the expectation be that it substantially affects (or even guides) the following tasks?   Yes, the research gaps and recommendations may guide subsequent tasks. 10.	Is it safe to assume that the (Task 3) assessment of intended audiences' needs for and interest in prevention content would be based on the findings from the systematic review?   Yes. 11.	How formal would you expect the "audience testing" (Task 6) to be, especially given the large number of areas to cover?   Testing will be guided by the results of task 3; a wide range of capabilities may be required for that task.  Offerors should present key personnel, experience, and organizational capabilities with this in mind.  Details of a recommended approach and testing plan may be more appropriately presented in subsequent proposals.   12.	The SOW refers to identifying and assessing up to 10 sets of existing health content (Task 4).  To confirm, by "content" are you referring to tangible prevention materials (such as Internet and print formats)?   Yes, the intent is to use actual materials in multiple formats such as Internet, print, multimedia, etc.  The emphasis of the comparative evaluation should be on the priority topics identified and it is  possible that suitable content may not exist for all topics in all appropriate formats.   13.	 In the SOW Task 6, it asks that, at a minimum, the topics of the content must include the 10 listed topics (e.g., tobacco use, physical activity).  Should we assume a different content set for each of the ten topics?    This question is not clear because the phrase "content sets" as used in the Notice and Statement of Work most frequently refers to the existing content to be identified and evaluated while task 6 specifically addresses the prototype content for testing that is to be developed based on the results of prior tasks.  Prototype content for each of the priority topics is required, and minimum formats of Internet and print are required.  Interactive or multimedia prototype content are also desirable. 14.	In the SOW Task 6, should we assume that there will be a different content set for each audience identified?  (i.e., if there are three audiences, then a total of 30 content sets be developed-one content set per audience per topic area?)    This is dependent on the outcome of task 3; offerors are asked to propose an approach under that task. 15.	Are design and development of multimedia objects (audio, video, and graphics) considered part of this project and therefore should we show our qualifications in this area?   Yes. 16.	Is translation of English language  materials into other languages such as Spanish considered part of this  project and therefore should we show our qualifications in this area?   Translation of the prototype content is not a requirement of this project; however, the research, recommendation, and guideline components of the project may include issues related to materials in languages other than English. 17.	Of the experience areas listed in the  announcement (i.e., research on health communication; Internet health   information; Internet evaluation methodologies; and effective communication with diverse audiences) which skills are most critical/important in ODPHP's opinion to the success of this project?   All the skills are critical.   18.	What can you tell us about the composition of the review committee for this Capabilities Statement?   Will the review be conducted solely by in-house ODPHP staff or will it also include external experts?   Capabilities statements will be evaluated by GovWorks and ODPHP staff.  Subsequent proposals will be evaluated by GovWorks staff and a panel of HHS employees with expertise in the relevant areas.

<CONTACT>David Lum, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-9587, Fax 202-260-0855, Email dlum@ibb.gov
<DESC>This is Amendment No. 1 To Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Number BBBGCON0803S5414 which was posted on September 30, 2003.  Amendment No. 1 provides answers to questions concerning the solicitation and extends the proposal due date to 2:00 PM EDT on Friday, October 24, 2003. 

Question #1 - Can proposals be submitted electronically or is facsimile the only method of submission?  If so, please provide contact email address.  
Answer #1 - No, proposals cannot be submitted electronically.  However, proposals can be submitted via facsimile at 202-260-0855 or via US Postal Service, Fed/Ex or UPS.  Note the actual document shall be physically received not later than the designated 2:00 PM EDT closing on Friday, October 24, 2003; otherwise, it shall be considered "late" and be considered as having arrived at the address specified for the receipt of offers "after" the exact time specified. 

Question #2 - Will all updates/modifications be communicated through the Federal Business Opportunity site?
Answer #2 - Yes, all amendments to the solicitation will be posted at the FedBizOpps website.   

Question #3 - How many on site personnel does the Government anticipate for this effort, and what will be their levels? What amounts have been budgeted/planned for this project or these services? Can you provide some level of effort estimate or some volume information that will provide vendors a basis for estimating a level of effort?
Answer #3 - The actual number of on-site personnel will be based on the Contractor.  This number could differ from the Government's estimate since the Offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government will ultimately determine the quantity and level of on-site personnel.  As a guide, the Government estimate is an on-site staff of 4 with one Senior member.  Offerors however, should propose that quantity, level and mix of qualified personnel that they think will be necessary to satisfy the requirement. Regarding the amount budgeted/planned for the subject services, this information is procurement sensitive.

Question #4 -- The announcement states that personnel are subject to passing a DOS Security Clearance.  Is a completed clearance a prerequisite for the project?  Some of our senior consultants have had a security clearance, but even an update can take months.  Would this delay the project? How long would it take for people that have never had a Federal ADP or DOS security clearance?  Who would pay for the security clearance?
Answer #4 - Contractor team members assigned to the subject BBG task will require background checks/security clearance from the BBG Office of Security and the DOS Bureau of Diplomatic Security to work on the subject task.  The Contractor shall plan for individuals who have never received security clearances and could possibly experience delay and/or denial which would require replacement. The Government will evaluate such security clearance information provided on key personnel designated by Offerors and assess such information appropriately in terms of potential impact on the subject task.
Question #5 -- Paragraph 3, sentence 2: Must the Contractor possess experience in using AMS FFS software for both domestic and overseas financial management interfaces?  If the Offeror is only familiar with the domestic financial management interfaces, is the Offeror out of consideration for the award?  Also Paragraph 2, bullet #3: What depth of knowledge are you looking for in the area of Department of State (DoS) domestic and overseas accounting and financial management systems and their interfaces? 
Answer #5 - AMS FFS experience is preferred but not required.  Those Offerors whose assigned key personnel demonstrate AMS FFS software experience with both DOS domestic and overseas financial management interfaces will receive higher evaluation ratings in terms of their strengths and value to BBG.  Proposals coming from Offerors whose assigned/key personnel are unable to fully demonstrate similar equivalent knowledge and experience naturally will have a longer learning curve and will be evaluated accordingly.

Question #6 - Are resumes required for all personnel or only key employees? 
Answer #6 - Resumes are mandatory for "all personnel" that an Offeror proposes as direct support and billable on their invoice for this requirement.  Resumes of other qualified personnel may be submitted, and their evaluation will be scored accordingly.

Question #7 - What facilities will BBG provide to contractor staff for performance of the services?  Is the space at BBG headquarters and at Rosslyn dedicated to the team, or will they have to pickup and move every few weeks as space becomes an issue?
Answer #7 - While working at BBG, the Contractor's staff members will be provided designated on-site office space, computer access and system access.  Other operational requirements an Offeror foresees as necessary and essential must be specified in their proposal for Government review and approval.  Otherwise, the Contractor shall assume all such ODC costs and expenses in their overhead and G&A.  Presently work space and conditions when required to work at the Department of State in Rosslyn are unknown.

Question #8 -- Will the company be reimbursed for expenses?  The RFP seems to indicate that this is a fully fixed bid transaction.
Answer #8 - As stated in Answer #7 above, the Contractor should submit fully burdened fixed price rate(s) that include all overheads, G&A, profit and Other Direct Costs.  

Question #9 -How many workstations are available?
Answer #9 - Currently four (4) computer workstations are available.  More workstations if necessary, can be obtained to provide an adequate working environment.  

Question #10 - How many funds/appropriations will be reconciled for the affected fiscal years? 
Answer #10 - Approximately 25 different appropriations are involved.

Question #11 -- What is the extent of the dollar difference(s) by fund?
Answer #11 - Approximately $30 million is the cumulative total statement of differences from October 1999 to the present.

Question #12 - What is the estimated average number of transactions (if available) applicable to this solicitation?  
Answer #12 - The exact number is unknown.  However, BBG estimates about 5,000 transaction per year, but there could be more.

Question #13 - How many entries need to be reconciled?
Answer #13 - Unfortunately, the number of entries to be reconciled is presently unknown.

Question #14 - How old are the entries, is there an aging schedule and is all of the documentation for clearing the entries local to Rosslyn or Washington, DC?
Answer #14 - Entries are not older than October 1999.  There is no aging schedule available.  The documentation needed for clearing entries is available in Washington DC and Rosslyn.

Question #15 - For those that are reconciled, does the team own responsibility for clearing them, or just identifying them for management?
Answer #15 - The Contractor shall be responsible for clearing them.

Question #16 - What financial systems does BBG use?
Answer #16 - BBG utilizes BFMS which is AMS Federal Financial System software.

Question #17 -- Is all of the necessary documentation readily available in electronic form?
Answer #17- No, most of the documentation is hardcopy files and records.  

Question #18-- Are all source documents (collection forms, disbursement forms, and cancellation forms) readily available?  Is the information for all periods, particularly the older periods readily available? Since this procurement is firm-fixed price, will BBG ensure the Contractor that BBG can provide all the necessary financial data needed to conduct the reconciliation in the time frame required?
Answer #18 - Yes, all source documents are available on-site at either BBG or the State Department. 

Question #19 -- Are all State Department documents available, including from overseas   sources, or do they need to be requested?
Answer #19 - Generally the State Department documents are available; but a written request may have to be completed in order to obtain needed documents.

Question #20 -- Please comment on the location and condition of the records that will be used to reconcile the statement and accounts.
Answer #20 - The accounting records are located at BBG and the State Department.  In some cases, they may not be complete and the condition of these documents are unknown.

Question #21 -- Does BBG have standard reconciliation procedures that the contractor must comply with?  If so, will this information be made available to all interested parties prior to the submission of proposals on October 17, 2003?
Answer #21 - No, BBG does not have standard reconciliation procedures.

Question #22 -- Will the contractor have access to DoS's Consolidated Cash Management System (CCMGMT) or does BBG have a system similar to this system that the contractor can use?
Answer #22 - No, the Contractor will not have access to CCMGMT and BBG does not have their own system.

Question #23 -- How can we attain Department of State Bureau of Finance and Management Policy and procedures?
Answer #23 -- They are available to the Contractor via our intranet web site, though we are in the process of updating them.

Question #24 - The solicitation refers to system analysis and internal controls, however there is no specific task or deliverables to analyze systems and controls or recommendations for improvements.  Is this part of the scope or is it strictly reconciliation?
Answer #24 - The primary requirement is reconciliation.  However, if the system is not functioning properly or an internal control allows or causes erroneous balances, BBG will expect the Contractor to be able to identify and alert BBG of any discrepancies. 

Question #25 -- For overseas activity, is there a requirement to actually travel to the overseas locations?
Answer #25 - No, BBG does not anticipate any overseas travel by the Contractor staff.

Question #26 - It is our understanding that BBG did not maintain separate accounting records prior to 2001.  The solicitation requires reconciliation of the Statement of Difference from October 1999.  The solicitation refers to cross-servicing support from the
Department of State (DoS). Is it intended that the Contractor will have to obtain records/support information from DoS? How will this support be prioritized at the DoS level to ensure timely responses? 
Answer #26 - Yes, BBG has maintained separate accounting records and a separate financial management accounting system since October 1999.  The Contractor shall work with the State Department Bureau of Finance and Management Policy (FMP), which has agreed to provide BBG the support needed to ensure BBG timely responses.  

Question #27 -- Is there a reason that the reconciliation's must start from October 99?
Answer #27 - Yes, October 1999 is the beginning date when the out balances began and when BBG became independent.

Question #28 - Are all analyses and reconciliation required for the same period (October 1999 through the present)?
Answer #28 -- Yes

Question #29 - Will you consider hands on reconciliation past performance of TFS 6652s and TFS 6653s that are more than 3 years? 
Answer #29 - There is no maximum period on how far back Offerors can reference their past performance experience.  The FBO notice does require Offerors to submit detailed information on their past performance, including recent (within the last 3 years from the date of this notice) and other relevant contracts for similar services. At a minimum Offerors must provide references of three (3) clients to whom they have provided similar services within the past three years.

Question #30 -- In the items required to be submitted to the contracting officer, Item [2] states "Narrative and detailed information on project plan and schedule."  What level of detail is required here?  We need detailed information on the nature and quantity of work to be performed in order to provide a detailed plan.  For example, how many items need to be reconciled and cleared with Treasury?  What is the nature of these items (i.e., how long have they been outstanding, what accounts or types of accounts are involved, etc.)
We also need more detailed information on the specific nature and quantity of work to be performed in order to develop and submit a firm fixed price for this work.  Please provide more information.
Answer #30 --  The level of detail required should explain how the Offeror intends to reconcile approximately 25 accounting appropriations dating back to October 1999 with a $30 million cumulative difference,

Question #31 -- You indicate this is a follow-on request to a previous attempt to procure these services, but the attempt was not completed.  Please explain.  What happened that the required service was not completed?"
Answer #31 -- The Agency initially solicited proposals from several sources off the GSA Schedules.  However, due to the nature of the requirement, the Agency has decided to advertise the revised SOW on full and open competition.

Question #32 -- Is there an incumbent contractor that will be eligible to compete for this work?  Who were the prior audit firm(s), if any, and what were the total amounts and hourly rates paid to the incumbent firm(s) for their services each year? And what were the total hours and hours by staffing category expended by the incumbent firm(s) each year?
Answer #32 - No, there is no incumbent Contractor and no contract or delivery order has been awarded for similar services in the past.  Presently this is a one-time nonrecurring requirement.
Question #33 - Has there been previous attempts to complete the reconciliation, have unreconciled items been identified and does the reconciliation involve the Treasury differences as well as the GL, financial statements, etc. or is it just the Treasury differences that we are reconciling?
Answer #33 - There has been no reconciliation attempts by a Contractor.  However, the State Department has provided some documentation to identify differences, but no actual reconciliation efforts outside of internal BBG resources have been utilized.  Balances and GL will need to be reconciled.

Question #34 -- Paragraph 1, sentence 6: Does the Department of State Bureau of Financial Management and Policy (FMP) prepare the FMS 224, Statement of Transactions, for BBG?
Answer #34 - The Department of State, Office of Accounting prepares the SF-224.

Question #35 -- Paragraph 1, sentence 7: How often has the FMS 224 been reconciled to the general ledger (BFMS)? If none were performed, are reconciliations required to be performed for the periods FY 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 by the contractor?
Answer #35 - Yes, the Department of State (DoS) has reconciled the actions for FY2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003.  However, the actions needed to clear the items that are present was not taken in all cases.

Question #36 -- Paragraph 2, sentence 1: (a) What specifically are you looking for when you state the Contractor is required to, '… coordinate a variety of financial processes, data, reports and financial documents…? (b) What are specific examples of reports and statements required by internal offices?
Answer #36 - The Contractor shall coordinate between BBG and the State Department offices, and have a full understanding of the basic financial processes in order to reconcile the accounts.   

Question #37 -- Paragraph 2, bullet #3: What are some of the operational irregularities that you are expecting? Do you expect that there is a possibility of 'intentional' irregularities? 
Answer #37 - BBG is not expecting any intentional irregularities.  The Contractor shall identify irregularities.

Question #38 -- Paragraph 2, bullet #5: What exactly are you looking for the Contractor to do in the area of 'Confirmation of Payment Schedules'? Please provide further details.
Answer #38 - The Contractor shall determine what Treasury schedules are not confirmed in financial system and confirm them if needed. 

Question #39 -- What is the purpose for issuing this solicitation, is there any third party reporting requirements?
Answer #39 - There are no third party reporting requirements.

Question #40 -- How flexible is the time period allotted?  Without knowing the details of potential problems it is difficult to project whether 90 days is an adequate time.
Answer #40  -- We have estimated 90 days as being adequate. However, in the event that substantial problems arise, as long as Contractor's actions are timely and documented in periodic updates, the Government will review the overall circumstances.  

Question #41 - Will the due date be extended beyond October 17, 2003? Will there be an extension based on when answers are provided?  If the answers are not received until the day before the deadline, then it will be difficult (if not impossible) to complete our proposal within the required timeframe. 

Answer #41 - Yes, the proposal due date is being extended one week.  All proposals shall be physically received not later than 2:00 PM EDT on Friday, October 24, 2003.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) COMBAT TALON-II PROGRAM 				 The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)  through a team at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and  Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) is analyzing  industry capabilities to convert 10 existing C-130 aircraft  into 10 MC-130 Combat Talon IIs.  This is an initial  industry opportunity to meet with cognizant government  representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the Mod-10 program.  Contractors will be given a  short descriptive briefing of the Mod-10 program on 4 March  2003.  Contractors will be given an opportunity to discuss  their understanding of the program and to present their  capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an  initial step in establishing industry understanding of the  Mod-10 program and to allow the government team to  determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government  does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this  RFI.  Submitting capabilities and concepts in response to  this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be  compensated.   In general terms, the program’s intent will be to  conduct an initial modification to 10 existing C-130H2  aircraft.  The modification will convert these ten aircraft  into Talon II “like” aircraft minus the avionic required to  perform the terrain following/terrain avoidance (TF/TA)  mission.  After completion of this initial modification  these ten aircraft will go directly into the existing C-130  Avionic Modernization Program (AMP)/ Common Avionic  Architecture for Penetration (CAAP) program.  The overall  objective will be after the Mod-10 and the AMP/CAAP  modification the final configuration of these aircraft will  be common, to the maximum extent possible, to the rest of  the Talon II fleet (post AMP/CAAP.)  Initial analysis by  the government indicates the systems listed in attachment 1  will be required to be installed as part of the Mod-10  program.  This list is intended to only provide initial  guidance and is to be considered a working document that  will evolve, as the requirements are better defined.   (Please contact Major Fahrenkamp to request a copy of  attachment 1 as it will not be posted on the internet)  In  addition to installing the current Talon II capability the  Mod-10 program will develop, install and test an Autonomous  Landing Guidance (ALG) system.  An important factor for  this program will be to ensure a smooth and timely  transition between the Mod-10 program and the AMP/CAAP  program.  Therefore, any approach presented to the  government is required to clearly define how this  transition can be accomplished.  Alternatives to these  capabilities/ systems will not be considered as the intent  of the Mod-10 program is to provide the Air Force Special  Operations Forces (AFSOC) with MC-130H Talon II  capabilities, seamless with current AFSOC aircraft in their  sustainment and support concept. General capabilities and concepts should be submitted  on CD-R in an electronic format that is compatible with  Microsoft Windows and Office 97.  One CD each should be  provided to Maj Mark Fahrenkamp at the address set forth  above or during the individual briefing session.  If the CD  contains proprietary/competition sensitive information, the  CD and cover label should be  marked "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information."   Also, two paper copies of the response should be submitted  unbound in three-ring binders and must be clearly  labeled "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information" on  the cover sheets and in close proximity to this type of  information on each applicable page.   Proprietary/competition sensitive information will be  protected from disclosure.  The paper copies and the  electronic versions must be identical in all respects.   Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches, not including  foldouts.  Pages shall be single-spaced.  The font size  shall be no less than 12 point.  Use at least 1-inch  margins.  For page counting purposes, double-sided pages  shall be treated as two pages.  Contractor paper copy  submittals shall not exceed 10 pages in length. No Classified information should be included in  contractor submittals, nor will any be discussed during the  March 2003 industry dates. In order to help us complete our planning we request  that you provide, by 21 Feb 03, a letter indicating your  intent to respond to this RFI.  Presentations of your  concepts/capabilities will be limited to 2 hours on either  4 or 5 March 2003.  Please contact Maj Fahrenkamp to  establish an individual briefing time. As stated earlier,  there will be an initial open session government overview  of the program, on the morning of 4 March 2003.    Any organization or company can obtain Combat Talon II  announcements and instructions via the Web at  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.  Questions regarding the  technical information being requested in this RFI should be  directed to Major Mark Hornbostel (937) 255-4577  mailto:mark.hornbostel@wpafb.af.mil.  All other questions  regarding this RFI should be directed to Major Mark  Fahrenkamp, ASC/LUK, (937) 255-2898,  mailto:Mark.Fahrenkamp@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON RESPONSES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS CODE 541710, WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking capability statements from qualified organizations to act as a contractor to provide a comprehensive program to ensure that clinical laboratories in developing countries around the world can reliably perform tests to monitor the safety and efficacy of preventive and therapeutic products as part of clinical HIV/AIDS trials sponsored by the NIAID.  There is a need to evaluate laboratories' ability and readiness to routinely conduct activities according to Good Laboratory Practice standards; to train, implement and monitor general QA/QC for pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical functions; to evaluate laboratories' ability to correctly perform required study-specific tests, provide troubleshooting and training when needed, and implement and monitor on-site QA/QC for these tests; to prepare laboratories for participation in external proficiency testing (PT) programs for these tests, monitor performance in such PT programs and assist when performance is poor;  to ensure that study-specific tests are performed correctly and results are reported accurately; to design and implement tools to evaluate the ability of laboratories to perform required tests for which PT programs do not exist; and, only as an emergency, perform study-specific tests when laboratories are unable to do so and/or to verify test results.  This will require  presence in developing areas that are centers of HIV infection, such as Southern Africa, Asia and the Caribbean Islands.  This will also require staff with medical technology/pathology background, expertise in training, knowledge of compliance with safety and ethics regulations, and knowledge of languages.  
Laboratories will require full or partial range of the services described above, depending on their initially-determined level of readiness to participate in NIAID studies.  It is anticipated that in the first year of contract operations one medical technologist will stay up to one year in each of four (4) laboratories in Southern Africa, four (4) in Asia and two (2) in the Caribbean Islands.  It is also anticipated that in the first year the contractor will conduct five (5) five-day visits for the purpose of assessment and/or trouble shooting to ten (10) laboratories in same regions as described above, and will conduct one regional three-day training workshop in each of these regions.  The Government anticipates the need to provide services to additional laboratories during the course of the contract.  

This effort will require  presence in developing areas that are centers of HIV infection, such as Southern Africa, Asia and the Caribbean Islands.  This will also require staff with medical technology/pathology background, expertise in training, knowledge of compliance with safety and ethics regulations, and knowledge of languages.  The prospective contractor must have a Principal Investigator and staff that have the experience and expertise to carry out a project of this size and complexity, must understand cultural sensitivity issues relevant to resource-constrained countries, and must have the flexibility to address emerging needs and expansion.  The contractor must also have laboratory facilities where actual safety tests (e.g. hematology, chemistries) can be performed.    Interested small business organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas above, to be received no later than 3:30 PM local time on October 27, 2003, to the attention of Glynis Fisher at the address listed above.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 22.  NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement. The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event. The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release. The purpose of this interactive Industry Day is to identify Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) best practices for Federal Stock Class 1680, which encompasses a variety of miscellaneous Aircraft accessories. 
A Joint Accessories Commodity Council has been formed, and will be pursuing the development of an AFMC enterprise sourcing strategy, which could result in contractual documents for new purchases and repairs for FSC 1680 items managed by the USAF and DLA. The goals of any forthcoming sourcing strategy will be to improve readiness, increase responsiveness of the supply chain and reduce costs.
 Industry input into the strategy development process is critical for the Government to understand the supply base capabilities related to achieving the above objectives. The Industry Day format will include a Government presentation on Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM), a general question and answer session, and a joint wrap up session. Suppliers are requested to identify improvements allowing the Government to meet the stated objectives. 
Suppliers interested in attending and/or presenting are requested to email or fax notice to participate no later than 20 Oct 03.  There will be a $25 conference fee for each attendee. The government anticipates releasing through this website one or more strategies as a result of this industry day, for supplier review and comment on by the end of Dec. 03. A follow-on Industry Day is currently anticipated for late Jan. 04.

<SUBJECT>99 -- TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY - MILES Hand Grenade Simulator System
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energy’s physical security needs, is looking for one or more companies in the MILES systems market to engage in commercialization of Sandia’s MILES hand grenade simulator system.  Sandia prefers that a company that commercializes this system do so in such a fashion that the hand grenade simulator system can be coupled with any commercial MILES system; it is acceptable to Sandia if the company chooses also to integrate it into their existing product suite.

Sandia is interested in commercial system integrators with well-documented experience in MILES systems, and with successful product offerings, strong market presence and established market, distribution and service channels.  Potential partners must provide Sandia information demonstrating that the partner has the stand-alone (sublicensing will not be acceptable) resources and expertise to design, develop, manufacture, distribute, market, and service fully functional MILES hand grenade simulator systems.  Sandia anticipates granting one or more non-exclusive licenses to the hand grenade simulator technology to qualified participants, with up-front licensing fees (a portion of which may cover Sandia’s technical assistance to the partner), royalties, annual minimums, and performance milestones.  Sandia prefers that a product be commercially available by 1 October 2004.  The licensee will acquire the rights to one patent pending for the hand grenade simulator transmitter and receiver hardware, as well as copyright for software that drives the microprocessors in both the grenade and the receiver and drawings of circuits in the grenade and the receiver.

The Sandia MILES hand grenade resembles a real hand grenade in weight and shape and is operated by pulling a pin.  The MILES hand grenade remains dormant until the palm switch is released, simulating the operation of an activating lever.  After a five-second delay an RF signal is emitted that activates the receivers that are in close proximity.  These receivers, which are mountable to any MILES harness, then listen for an acoustic cue and use the delay time between the arrival of the electronic signal and the acoustic signal to determine the distance from the “detonation”.  The acoustic cue also mimics the “detonation” of a real hand grenade, which enhances the reality of the training simulation.  After “detonation” a momentary, intermittent, beep is emitted that allows easy location of the MILES hand grenade.

The Sandia MILES hand grenade comes closer than any commercially available system to simulating casualties created by a hand-thrown grenade.  The “kill” radius matches the 5-meter industry standard and is not affected by paper barriers or other materials that would inappropriately “protect” the combatant trainee.  The receiver, which is powered by a rechargeable 9-volt battery, will work independently or as an addition to all MILES systems and also has the capability to record which MILES hand grenade activated it.

To express your interest in this technology transfer opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski by 21 November 2003 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque New Mexico 87185-0115. Fax (505) 844-8011- No phone calls, please. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice.  Include company and contact information, as well as a description of how your company meets Sandia’s criteria and could best contribute to the commercialization of this technology.

US Army PEO Combat Support and Combat Service Support (CS & CSS), PM Force Projection, PM Army Watercraft Systems is gathering information regarding the availability of equipment and subsyste ms to support the C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) requirements of the Theater Support Vessel (TSV).   Background: A critical mission need exists within the Army for a high-speed intra-theat er lift capability that is capable of operations in austere environments while meeting the operational needs of the Future Combat System (FCS), the Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) and current forces.  The Army is developing the next generation intra-the ater watercraft, the TSV, to increase operational throughput and to provide future commanders with responsive and agile intra-theater lift for the Objective Force.  The TSV will leverage the exploitation of COTS technologies developed in the commercial sec tor and GOTS developed within DOD.  Systems Integration technologies are expected to focus on the architectural advantages of commercial digital components for the overall effectiveness and efficiency of vessel operations integrating both Ã¢Â€ÂœcommercialÃ ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœmilitaryÃ¢Â€Â operating subsystems.  This System-of-Systems approach is expected to optimize the use of bus architectures, built-in-test, high-reliability components, and advanced maintenance concepts.  Most important is the requirement to  systems engineer and integrate the VesselÃ¢Â€Â™s commercial based communications, electronics and navigation with the VesselÃ¢Â€Â™s military based command and control systems.
