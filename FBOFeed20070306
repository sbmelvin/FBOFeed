<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure a technical expert that would work with the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) to develop programs and initiatives involving interdisciplinary collaborative research across the full range of disciplines and stakeholders necessary to fully elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges.

The period of performance is from the date of award to September 29, 2008 with one option year from September 30, 2008 to September 29, 2009.  The place of performance will include NIH and offsite (including contractor facility).


Background:

OBSSR furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.  

Based on its Strategic Prospectus, OBSSR?s vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR?s plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary ?team science? that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis ? from cells to society ? required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop programs and initiatives involving interdisciplinary collaborative research across the full range of disciplines and stakeholders necessary to fully elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges.  Such collaborations will yield new conceptual frameworks, methods, measures, and technologies that will speed the improvement of population health.

Scope of Work:

Despite the growing enthusiasm for interdisciplinary approaches and recent models of success, broad acceptance of interdisciplinary research remains a goal for the future.  In consultation with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff, the Contractor shall develop programs and initiatives to facilitate an interdisciplinary, team-based approach to population health research by fostering collaborations among the broad base of stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, employers, practitioners, patients, and the general public) needed to ensure the implementation and adoption of scientific findings.

The contractor shall participate in planning and advising on implementation of the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving interdisciplinary research. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following seven key OBSSR goals:

Background:

OBSSR furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop research programs and initiatives in dissemination science and communications.
 
Scope of Work:

In today?s digitally connected environment, an infrastructure for better communications and dissemination represents a key part of OBSSR?s communications strategy.  Improving the nation?s health requires knowledge of behavior change and interactive technologies (e.g., e-health, internet-based interactive technology to change behavior).  Communications is a multi-directional process that links communities of research and practice.  Public health interventions cannot save lives if they are not implemented, and research cannot improve health if it is not informed by the needs and experiences of practitioners.  Building communication channels that link all of the stakeholders of public health into a living, participatory community will form a critical backbone for the way we approach health, disease, and wellness in the future.

The contractor shall participate in planning and advising on implementation of the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving the science of dissemination and communication strategies and goals. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following three key OBSSR strategic goals:

1.	Identifying what is known and where the gaps are in the general public?s understanding of evidence-based behavior, change tools and technology, especially e-health and interactive web, telephone and other electronic media.  

2.	Identifying or creating dissemination channels for sharing social and behavioral science perspectives, constructs, and measures in health research.

3.	Working with other expert consultants, coordinate a workgroup to identify social marketing strategies, understanding of consumer demand and direct to consumer advertising approaches to educating the public about behavioral science tools.  .  

4.	Identifying key audiences and tailoring strategic communications strategies to those audiences to increase awareness of behavioral tools.

5.	Developing a method to gather and identify the best evidence-based practices and policies for behavior change.

6.	Developing plans to improve the health literacy of the public and their ability to identify and use evidence-based behavior change tools.

Further, for each of the specific objectives developed to address the goals listed above, the Contractor shall develop performance measures that may be utilized to assess OBSSR?s performance in achieving these goals and objectives.  

All objectives should meet the SMART criteria (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timed).

?	Specific ? Be precise about what OBSSR is going to achieve in the area of problem based research. 
?	Measurable ? Quantify the objectives. 
?	Achievable ? Is OBSSR attempting too much?

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with: Thomson Scientific, 3501 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104.  
No solicitation exists for this requirement.  The products are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.  The total contracted dollar amount will not exceed $5.5 million; therefore it will be solicited under the Commercial Test Program as authorized under FAR 13.5.  The period of performance shall be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for four (4) successive twelve (12) month periods.  It is believed that Thomson Scientific is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 per FAR Part 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 because of the below:

The Web of Knowledge consists of the databases Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) Expanded and recently Biological Abstracts.  Both the databases and the Web of Knowledge platform are proprietary products of Thomson Scientific.  Both are copyrighted products.  For the past 10 years the Web of Knowledge has served as the basis of the NIH Porpoise current awareness service.  Thousands of research interest profiles have been developed by NIH researchers to track the latest publications in their areas of research. Porpoise was developed by CIT in the 1990?s because no comparable capability was available. These profiles, developed on the intranet version, which was loaded on NIH servers, transferred to the current awareness product now available on the Internet version of Web of Knowledge.  The product is a valuable resource that is critical for NIH staff in keeping up with the published literature.  No other product on the market offers the depth of coverage (more than 6000 scientific, medical, technical and social science journals indexed from as early as 1840 to the present).

Attached to this notice is the Draft Statement of Work.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit capability statements to the Contract Specialist by March 15, 2007 at 3PM EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Address responses to the attention of Zedekiah J. Worsham at National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 541E, MSC 7663, Rockville, MD 20852.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 511140 with a business size of 500 employees.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administrations Office of Research and Development conducts a variety of research programs for improving rail transportation efficiency and safety.  Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRAs intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.  The RFP will also contain 2 optional years requiring roughly 10,000 labor hours per year.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using Fed Biz Ops on February 21, 2006.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane has a requirement for a Research and Development (R&D) effort in a spiral development of a Maritime Domain Identification System.  The MDIS shall detect radar emissions, identify the host platform, determine the level of interest based on other received intelligence, correlate the intercept with other sensor data for geo-location and tracking, and provide alerts to cue safe interdiction prior to entry.  MDIS development is planned as a five year effort culminating with operational testing of full capability Engineering Development Model (EDM) and initial production units.  It is anticipated that the resulting contract will procure development, proof of concept, a first article, and limited production through three phases.  The Proof of Concept Phase will cover MDIS concept development, analysis of alternatives, preliminary system specifications/drawings, development of initial capabilities; sensor suite evaluation, proof of concept syst!  em development and sensor integration, and proof of concept demonstration.  The First Article/Prototype system development will cover MDIS prototype system development, system/COTS enhancement (technology insertion), design and interface specifications, user scrutiny event, support of the development of requests for information associated with Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) capabilities, and market survey for selection of technology insertion SEI capabilities.  The initial production and field plan phase will cover MDIS EDM system development, integration of selected new SEI capabilities, investigation of range extension technologies, operational testing, full product specification and documentation, and support of technology transition to selected end user for deployment.     This R&D requirement is anticipated to result in a 5-year, Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with options.  Contract Data Requirements Lists will be included in the solicitation to support data deliverables.  Inspection and acceptance will be at destination by NSWC Crane personnel. Other than full and open competition procedures will be utilized with Electronic Warfare Assoicates  Government Systems Incorporated in accordance with FAR 6.302.

In many cases, the Contractor may be able to correct the problem at no cost or, as authorized, with low-cost measures such as replacing a bad photocell.  Refer more complex problems and recommended corrective actions to the Energy Manager for correction.  In all cases, provide an economic analysis to help justify the work.  Build, train and maintain an effective network of Building Energy Monitors (BEM) in NRH facilities.   Provide initial and annual BEM training, maintain communications, provide feedback on building energy performance through MVWeb and other information management systems, alert them to any anomalies noted, and provide appropriate recognition and other incentives to help sustain their active participation.  Training and Participation in Conferences/Workshops/Seminars as necessary to perform the work shall be at no additional cost to the Government.  Analyze and provide recommendations to optimize facility operations to minimize utility consumption.  Identify and update a list of facilities with greatest potential for energy cost savings based on annual utility consumption.  Subject to the Energy Program Leadership, work with NAVFAC HI to determine how those buildings are operated and recommend ways to operate more efficiently.  Recommendations may include controls on building systems, Operations and Maintenance (O&M) measures such as turning off equipment and lights in vacant areas, replacing inefficient equipment, commissioning/ recommissioning/constant commissioning existing equipment, incorporation of new equipment to improve performance of existing equipment, etc.  The Contractor will support activities for the Navy?s Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Program, including bench- and pilot-scale demonstrations of energy efficiency and resource conservation technologies and management solutions to help NAVFAC HI determine how these measures help facilities operate more efficiently.  Prepare technology evaluation reports and other technology transfer materials in support of the RDT&E Program.  Recommendations that are beyond the ability of the activity to implement shall be referred to the appropriate office, with economic analysis, for a possible project.  Support and enhance the NAVFAC HI energy awareness program.  Plan and carry out continual energy awareness activities (including Energy Awareness Week); provide awareness briefings to Public Works Officers (PWOs), Building First Lieutenants (BFLs), staff meetings and others; develop and sustain meaningful awards and other incentive programs.  Support Utility Demand Reduction (UDR) program to maximize cost avoidance.  Identify and develop energy management initiatives, O&M measures and projects to enhance the effectiveness of the UDR program.  Measures may include building a comprehensive and current UDR call list; identifying loads that can be controlled during load sheds, and working out agreements with the facilities to do so; making broadcast e-mail and Audix load-shed announcements; training BFLs how to respond to load-shed calls; and recommending other ways to reduce demands.  Identify potential energy projects, programs and initiatives.  In the course of carrying out its tasks under this contract, the Contractor may find energy conservation opportunities beyond the scope of the contract.  Some opportunities may be of project scope and some may call for programs and initiatives by others.  Identify such opportunities to the appropriate offices for their consideration.  Apply for Standard Performance Contracts (SPC), rebates and grants to help sustain the project and maximize returns.  Apply for all appropriate SPCs, rebates and grants for Navy energy projects and programs.  Prepare reports, databases, computer analyses and other documentation; perform cost analyses; perform measurement and verification; submit reports; and otherwise satisfy all SPC, rebate and grant requirements.  This task is information-intensive and will require the establishment and maintenance of highly complex information databases and charts.  Coordinate energy projects and provide consultation during construction phase of energy projects.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541618 and the annual size standard is $6.5 Million.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  Only the base period of the contract will offer a minimum guarantee.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.  The Government will not synopsize the options when exercised.

<DESC>The Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Office of Aviation (INL/A) has identified a requirement to acquire an Infrared (IR) small arms detection system supporting INL/A operations.  

This is an INL/A initiative to rapidly field a small arms detection and warning system for aircrew alert and situational awareness of active threat weapons firings.  This program is designed to increase the safety and survival of aircrews and their mission aircraft by alerting them, in near real-time (less than 1 second), of hostile fire events in order to avoid them.  The system will be integrated in an INL/A OV-10D and flown to verify and demonstrate its effectiveness.  Additionally, the event will be transmitted to an additional aircraft flying in support.  The system on the support aircraft will consist of a display and the necessary datalink equipment to receive the alert information in the form of a geo-rectified position and basic vector to the point of origin of the event.

This requirement includes installation of the required system sensors on an INL/A OV-10D and demonstration of the effectiveness of the system in CONUS.  Once successfully tested in CONUS the system will be moved to a TBD OCONUS location for demonstration to prove the system in the actual operational environment.  This effort provides aircrews the opportunity to see and verify the system capabilities and allows for user input before determining if the effort should be continued on a larger number of aircraft in the INL/A fleet.  As a baseline, the aircraft will be outfitted with a system providing a minimum of 240 degrees (preferably 360 degrees) of horizontal coverage. 

A draft copy of the solicitation statement of work is provided for industy comment before the final solicitation is released.     Comments on the draft solicitation statement of work may be emailed to Patrick Murphy - murphypj@state.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRAs intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administrations Office of Research and Development conducts a variety of research programs for improving rail transportation efficiency and safety.  Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRAs intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.  The RFP will also contain 2 optional years requiring roughly 10,000 labor hours per year.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using Fed Biz Ops on February 21, 2006.  No written copies will be available.

<DESC>This acquisition will be conducted as Full and Open; responsible large and small businesses may participate.  This requirement may include Air Force, FMS and/or other service requirements.  Quantities include the following Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs):

Type I:  Basic: 12, Option I: 12, Option II: 12  (Total = 36 ea)
Type II: Basic: 2, Option I: 2, Option II: 1 (Total = 5 ea)


The Major Programs Team in the Support Equipment and Vehicles Contracting Office (GBKBB) within the 642d Combat Sustainment Group (CBSG) is responsible for procuring Computerized Radiography (CR) digital imaging systems for Nondestructive Inspections (NDI) in military aircraft maintenance environments. The imaging systems will detect abnormalities, stress areas, and other such physical findings in a variety of metallic and non-metallic aircraft products.

The Radiography Digital system, uses photostimulable phosphor imaging plates as the collection media for radiographic data. The system operates in the same fashion as x-ray films used for the purpose of NDI evaluation, except that the phosphors are capable of being erased and re-used. An automated programmable method of extracting the data and subsequently erasing the phosphors and a method for displaying and storing the images shall be provided by the contractor.

The solicitation will contain a line item for a first production unit and associated testing. As the system is commercial and of the type commonly found in metallurgy laboratories and precision machining facilities in the private as well as public sector, the testing will be minimal and will serve to confirm that the system adheres to the requirements of the Purchase Description. 

Request for Proposal Components:  It is expected that a Performance-Price Tradeoff (PPT) will be utilized to evaluate potential offerors.  The RFP will provide full instructions and evaluation criteria.  The resultant contract is expected to be a 3-year, requirements type contract, with one basic year and 2 Option Years.  The basic year will include Pre-Production Units (one Type I and one Type II) and associated Data line items.  The proposal will include Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs) for each year as follows:  Basic Year: 12, Option I: 12 and Option II: 12.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541612   U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HUMAN RESOURCES SUPPORT SERVICES RFQ-DC-07-00069 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, PART 2 Question #4:  Does the requirement require seven Senior Specialists to fill each of the areas described in Attachment A (Staffing, Classification, Labor  Relations, HR Development, HR Policy, Benefits, and Information Management) or one person that is proficient in all of the these fields?   Answer #4:  Several Human Resources specialists may be required for some of the areas.  For example, two to four staffing specialists may be needed.  The EPA  prefers specialists who are trained and specialized in specific areas of Human Resources.  However, one person may sufficiently do the work in more than one area if that person is experienced in one or more disciplines, such as staffing and classification.  However, the EPA may need specifically  the assistance of classifiers, as was recently the case, to conduct a special classification study for one of the program offices.  Additionally, the EPA has two Human Resources specialists who work in the Executive Resources Division, providing expertise in staffing, classification, and the  development of the Agency's Senior Executive Service employees.   Question #5:  For how many EPA employees will this requirement potentially support? Answer #5:  The Headquarters Human Resources Office provides staffing/recruitment services to EPA headquarters employees, which is approximately  7,500 people, and the general public, but not necessarily all at once.  For example, the contractors will work with supervisors, managers, and subject matter experts to complete job analyses and develop vacancy announcements and post them on the Agency's automated recruitment system.  When the  advertisement is open, they may respond to questions from both EPA employees and the public concerning the announcement and the status of applicants.   Question #6:  How many contractor personnel have supported this contract previously? Answer #6:  As few as two to three and as many as ten  contractor personnel have worked on this requirement previously.  The number depends on the projects and initiatives that occur during the course of the year.  Oftentimes, there is little notice if a new initiative comes up, requiring the EPA to gear up in a hurry to deliver products or services. Question #7:  In terms of recruiting responsibilities, what is the average number of job openings that this contract will support on a monthly basis? Answer #7:  The number varies.  The work is voluminous and exceeds the capacity of the federal employees available on staff.   Question #8:  Can  you provide more details on the topics for training and the number of people to participate in training sessions under this contract? Answer #8:  Training may vary as well, depending on what initiatives come up.  One example includes the conversion to the EPA's new performance management system  that was rolled out to all employees.  In Headquarters, the EPA needed contractor support for training on the new system.  The EPA continues to provide training to Headquarters managers, supervisors, and employees on this system.  Also, in 2003 and 2004, the agency offered an Early Out retirement  program.  The EPA quickly had to offer training to employees at Headquarters who were interested in availing themselves of the opportunity to retire early.  The training consisted of a number of courses to cover the many retirement options available to employees.  Approximately twenty training  sessions were held during one month with contractor assistance.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541612   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Human Resources Support Services RFQ-DC-07-00069 Questions and Answers Question #1:  Is there an incumbent currently performing these services?  If so, what are the company's name, the contract number, the dates, and the amount of  the contract?   Answer #1:  There is an incumbent for this requirement.  The current contract, Contract No. 4W-2303-NBLX, is with FPMI Solutions.  The period of performance is from September 30, 2004 to around February 28, 2007.  The total amount of the current contract is over $1,000.000.00.   Question #2:  If there is an incumbent, can the incumbent compete on the new requirement? Answer #2:  If the decision is made to set aside this requirement for small businesses, the incumbent will not be able to compete. Question #3:  Can the NAICS code be changed to 561210, Facilities Support  Services? Answer #3:  The Government believes it has identified the NAICS code that best reflects the work to be done under this requirement.  Therefore, the NAICS code will remain 541612. Any additional questions must be emailed to Melissa Kaps, kaps.melissa@epa.gov, by 5:00 p.m. EST on Monday,  January 8, 2007.

Only those businesses located in the immediate Washington, DC Metropolitan area will be considered. 

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection intends to solicit proposals for onsite training support services in the Office of Training and Development (OTD) at CBP Headquarters in Washington, D.C., for the planning, design, development, testing, and implementation of training courseware.  CBP anticipates awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.

The office directly executes career development programs, basic and advanced training to all occupations, and management and executive development programs. OTD also develops and implements the annual training plan for the agency, defines and implements evaluation measures, data collection processes, and inspection methods for ongoing assessment of all CBP training programs. In this effort, the contractor will furnish, as required, training support personnel and services to assist OTD in development of traditional classroom, technology and blended learning training projects and programs.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to procure on a sole source basis, software development iterations, systems integration, and maintenance support services for the Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC) from Northrop Grumman Defense Mission Systems (NGMS) in San Diego, California.  The justification permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  A Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) for the software development iterations to versions 7.0 and 7.1 and Time and Materials (T&M) for current engineering services and continuing operations of Post Deployment Software Support to provide continued maintenance effort is anticipated.  The total estimated cost of this acquisition is $64,700,000.  The estimated date of contract award is April 2007.  The Period of Performance is through FY 11.  The proposed contractual acti!  on will procure C2PC Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) that incorporate: (1) auto-promotion of Joint Range Extension Application Protocol (JREAP) air tracks as GCCS Link-16 tracks; (2) address book synchronization with U.S. Army systems; (3) the latest Common Message Processor to achieve Navy-Marine Corps Internet (NMCI) certification; (4) correction of software trouble reports as directed by the project office; and (5) EarthWhere capability.  This effort will be used to procure any additional ECPs necessary throughout the C2PCs service life and for integration tasks involving third party injectors, core injectors and updates to the Windows operating system.  Funds will be allocated to provide for continued refactoring of the C2PC software, with the primary goal of making C2PC more reliable, maintainable and expansible.  Continuing C2PC maintenance spirals, i.e. conducting development and testing necessary to sustain integration and interoperability with other Marine C!  orps systems, Joint systems and other Service systems, re-architect C2 PC to bring it into compliance with major OSD-directed initiatives such as Open Architecture, DoD Information Systems Registry (DISR) and Internet Protocol Version Six (IPV).  Basic post-deployment software maintenance support including help desk services throughout C2PCs service life estimated to continue through the end of FY 2011.  This effort will enable the Marine Corps to ultimately competitively source the C2PC capability by individual module of functionality, and prepare C2PC for transition into the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Network Enabled Command and Control (NECC) world of the future.  The contractor shall provide the above-mentioned program management, training, software design, code and test, technical support for systems integration, and functional software to support the C2PC Program.  In response to Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Memorandum 161-03, the Marine Corps and the Army agreed to migrate to a single platform at the brigade !  and above echelons in order to improve interoperability.  The designated platform is C2PC.  The core functionality of C2PC must be enhanced to meet Army requirements in order to achieve the desired interoperability.  NGMS is the only viable source capable of developing, testing, integrating and delivering the required software functionality due to their extensive knowledge of C2PC and the complexity of the existing software code.  NGMS is the current developer of the 7.0 and 7.1 C2PC software.  No source code or any other data package is available for competition.  The contract that will be modified is M67854-06-C-2023 is available by request.  See Numbered Note 22*. *22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

3.  SUPERVISION:

The Senior Financial Management Advisor will receive general guidance from the INL Executive Director/Controller.  As a recognized authority in financial and organizational management programs and issues, the incumbent will receive only administrative and policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives.  Specific assignments frequently originate out of the liaison activities of the work, and the  incumbent independently negotiates the scope and objectives of projects with little input or review by his/her supervisor.  Since the incumbent is physically located in Bangkok, he/she will exercise considerable independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches in analyzing and reviewing INL?s programs in the region for which he/she has responsibility.

4. SUPERVISION EXERCISED:

The incumbent has responsibility for supervising a non-Direct Hire multi-disciplined staff (Budget Analyst, Program Analyst and Auditors) in the performance of accounting and auditing activities relating to international counternarcotics and anticrime programs throughout the 28 countries for which he/she is responsible.

5.  GUIDELINES:

Guidelines include basic legislation, in particular Chapter 8 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Other laws, including other authorities under the FAA, several Narcotics Control Acts, the Narcotics Control Trade Act, the Arms Export Control Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Program Appropriations Act (which appropriates funds for the INL programs), other supplemental appropriation laws, and the State Department Basic Authorities Act, also contain provisions relevant to the programs for which INL has responsibility.  In addition, broad agency policy statements for the program may include reference to pertinent legislative history.  The Senior Financial Management Advisor must exercise considerable judgment in interpreting and adapting existing precedents and in developing new or improved approaches in analyzing controversial and nationally important subjects to persons with conflicting views.  The incumbent is recognized as an expert in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on financial and organizational management issues.

6.  COMPLEXITY:

The work involves planning, organizing, and completing financial and organizational analysis of enormous complexity.  Frequently due to the high visibility and political sensitivity related to the issues with which the Bureau deals, there is extreme difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues or problems and in planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of studies/audits to be undertaken.  Difficulty is also encountered in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the nature and magnitude of programs or issues.  Also, in discerning the intent of legislation and policy statements and determining how to translate the intent into program actions. 

7. SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS:

The Senior Financial Management Advisor performs very broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program, in excess of $1 Billion, spanning the full range of counternarcotics, anticrime, and civilian policing programs throughout the region serviced by the Bangkok Financial Center, which is of significant interest to the public and to the Congress.  The INL programs have a significant impact on the domestic and overseas operations of this, as well as other agencies.  The incumbent will be required to travel to and work in hazardous duties areas, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, on a frequent basis.

8.  PERSONAL CONTACTS:

The incumbent works closely with the senior management team of the INL Bureau, and with senior managers in other Bureaus, other agencies, and at the overseas posts for which he/she has regional responsibility.  He/she may also have dealings with principal and senior management representatives from private sector firms with existing or pending contractual relationships with the Department, as well as Congressional staffs.

<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to identify potential offerors for Maintenance, Repair, Operations or Overhaul Services for the Admiral Clarey (Ford Island) Bridge Facility, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  The Ford Island Bridge Facility is comprised of pile supported viaduct structures, hinged 120 and 250 foot composite steel/Portland cement concrete transition spans and a 930 foot long movable concrete pontoon section at the navigation harbor channel.  The bridge's concrete components are constructed of Portland cement with a micro-silica fume additive.  The movable pontoon section retracts back under the raised transition spans to provide a clear opening for the passage of ships.  The pontoon extends and locks in place with the lowered transition spans to provide vehicle passage across the bridge.  The retraction and extension operation is accomplished automatically by a programmable logic controller, pre-programmed to sequence the hydraulic operated transition span lift cylinders and winch to control the pontoon?s movement.  A microwave communication system transmits control signals to synchronize the hydraulic operated lift cylinders across the bridge open channel.  This contract will include preventive maintenance (including bridge operation), service calls, and repairs.  The work will include the bridge?s viaduct, hinged transition spans, movable pontoon, hydraulic systems (which includes the hydraulic controlled machinery and lift cylinders), microwave communications, integrated bridge control system, pontoon leak detection, closed circuit television, roadway traffic signal and control, fire and intrusion detection, bridge electrical systems, catwalks and landings, and other supporting components necessary to maintain the bridge?s operational and safety standards.  The repairs will include service and construction work.  The intent of the construction type of repairs is limited to cosmetic and minor structural repairs.  This contract is not intended to perform major construction work. 

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 488490 and the annual size standard is $6.5 million.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  

Interested parties must submit the following information:  (1) Full name and address of the firm and (2) A statement regarding your business size (e.g. 8(a), small business, large business, hubzone).  Interested parties may submit their response to shari.lillie@navy.mil.  

This sources sought announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  If issued, the solicitation will utilize source selection procedures, which require offerors to submit technical and price proposals.

Interested parties shall submit the requested information by 3/21/07.

4)	Points-of-failure.

5)	Inter- and intra-dependencies.

6)	Impacts of loss.

2.  Assume the port is important for military force projection but also used for commercial operations.  The following tasks are important:

             Task 1:  Conduct terminal operations
             Task 2:  Move forces 
             Task 3:  Sustain forces

3.  Show how you would decompose the mission to successfully execute the deployment, sustainment and redeployment of US Armed Forces through the fictional port of Maine.  Give examples to include identification of the infrastructures along with potential dependencies and vulnerabilities.  Response format is left up to the source.

<DESC>Precast Prestressed Concrete Pavement Potential Sources Sought 

Potential Sources Sought. This is not a RFP. 
  
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for an anticipated award to advance the knowledge and use of precast prestressed concrete pavement through technology transfer and development of industry guidance for design and engineering.  The effort will consists of two distinct yet related parts: 

Part A:  Strategy for technology transfer concerning the PPCP system in both the agency/owner and industry communities.  This part of the effort will require the organization and coordination of program activities among the agency/owner and industry communities utilizing periodic in-person meetings, conference calls, listserv and mailing lists, workshops, seminars, conferences; and, through the preparation and distribution of printed and electronic documents including, but not limited to, informational flyers, technical briefs, videos and technical reports.

Part B:  Strategy for development of industry guidance for design and engineering of the PPCP system. This part of the effort will require organization and coordination of program activities among agency/owner and industry communities through the use of technical group meetings and related activities; and, through the publication and dissemination of guidance documents concerning the design and engineering of the PPCP system. FHWA anticipates that the recently established Pavement Committee of the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute will have a key roll in the development and dissemination of such guidance. 

The FHWA Office of Pavement Technology has an ongoing concrete pavement technology program to develop and transfer new technologies related to improved concrete pavement performance.  One of the projects within that program is Prestressed Precast and Post-Tensioned Concrete Panels for Pavement Construction and Rehabilitation (DTFH61-05-00035).  This innovative approach to pavement construction and rehabilitation is being advanced by FHWA as the precast prestressed concrete pavement (PPCP) system.  

Under the contract cited above, FHWA is providing engineering support and funding to State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in a series of demonstration projects to advance the use of the PPCP system for a variety of construction and rehabilitation applications. The principal benefits of this innovative technology include reduced lane closure times and longer pavement life. Four PPCP projects have been constructed to date utilizing precast concrete panels that are manufactured at precast plants and then delivered, installed and post-tensioned on-site. These PPCP projects, in chronological order, were constructed in Texas, California, Missouri, and Iowa. Each of the PPCP demonstration projects has required unique design features, thereby demonstrating the flexibility of the PPCP concept.

New complementary efforts are needed to create national awareness, acceptance and implementation of this innovative pavement technology. This effort needs to be focused not only on State DOTs but also on the entire precast/prestressed concrete industry, including engineers, architects, precast concrete producers, material suppliers and associate members, as well as conventional pavement contractors, in order to develop industry guidance for design and engineering that will be accepted and used by all parties. 
The awardee selected will be expected to have capabilities in:
Technical and engineering, Capabilities to fully understand the technical aspects of the PPCP system and to convey that knowledge to other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways. The development of industry guidance for design and engineering of PPCP will be a major focus of this effort. Technical and engineering staff members should be conversant in current and relevant topics concerning best practices for concrete materials and concrete production, and best practices for concrete pavement design, construction, repair, and rehabilitation.  
Communications and marketing, Capabilities to develop, maintain and utilize a variety contact lists such as listserv and mailing lists.  Timely transfer of information, including feedback from other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways will be critical to the development of satisfactory guidelines. Other capabilities that would be considered useful include editorial and document production services.
Project management and reporting Capabilities to perform and/or direct the efforts of technical, engineering, communications, and marketing staff. Timely and cost-effective performance in each of these areas is required. 

The estimated period of performance for the project is five years.  FHWA anticipates a level of effort ranging from 2 to 4 professional and technical staff members per year for the duration of the project.  

Note: The level of activity will greatly depend on continued and additional funding under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to FHWA. 

RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE: Any interested organizations are invited to submit a Capability Statement by March 21, 2007, by e-mail to Katasha.White@DOT.gov, or in writing to Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, Attn: Ms. Katasha G. White, HAAM 40F, Room 4410, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington DC, 20590.     

Capability Statements shall clearly identify the following items regarding the interested organization(s): (1) name and address of prospective organization(s); (2) technical capabilities to perform the work; (3) relevant experience and credentials; (4) synopsis of experience and expertise of potential staff; (5) relevant projects completed related to the anticipated objectives of the project with information on the client, scope, and products; and (6) a description of available facilities to perform the work outlined above.  The Capability Statement shall be no more than 10 pages in length single-spaced with font size twelve or larger. For questions concerning this announcement contact Katasha G. White at 202-366-6622.

<DESC>MISSION NEED STATEMENT FOR (Establishing Auxiliary Power Unit Overhaul) 1. Defense Planning Guidance Element. This Mission Need Statement outlines the need for the establishment of an overhaul facility at Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD) for the T-62T-2B Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).  The overwhelming requirement for the T2B APU requires an additional source for mai ntenance be established to support that need.    2. Mission and Threat Analyses. a. Mission.  This overhaul capability will provide an Army capable source to implement Best Business Practices resulting in reduced APU and component repair turn around time, smaller required inventory levels because of streamlined material integration pro cesses, improved readiness, increased depot capacity and reduced total ownership cost through a streamlined logistics infrastructure. b. Threat.  This requirement will affect Army missions worldwide.  However, the scope of work requires the entire workload for this requirement to be conducted at the establishing facility in Corpus Christi, TX. 3. Non-materiel Alternatives. Non-material alternatives for this requirement would be inadequate.  In order to provide a serviceable and workable product, a material integration strategy would have to be a part of the requirement. 4. Potential Materiel Alternatives. The Army currently has a Depot Maintenance Interservice Agreement (DMISA) being utilized to overhaul this APU at Cherry Point Naval Air Station.  Cherry Point is not able to support the Armys need to better control configuration management on this item. In an effort to improve configuration management, the need to establish overhaul capabilities at an Army facility has become a necessary.  Inter-service cooperation will continue.     5.  Constraints. a. Manpower and Personnel.  Estimated manpower requirements include 2 Man Years for engineering support and 1 Man Year of Program Management support.  There is an additional requirement of 1 Man year for a parts warehouse manager to handle supply chain and  parts kitting operations. b. Training.  N/A c. Human Factors Engineering, Safety and Health Hazards.   CCAD, an ISO 9001 Certified facility, is one of the largest helicopter overhaul and repair facilities in the world.  In addition to Army aircraft, they overhaul/repair helicopters and components for the Air Force, Navy and Marines.  As the Cornerstone of A viation Readiness, their multi-skilled and dedicated workforce, backed by state of the art facilities and equipment, support a wide range of weapon and component systems.  CCADs capabilities are backed by extensive test facilities.  Equipment and maintena nce hangars are required to support multi-weapon systems such as AH-64, H-60 and CH-47 aircraft platforms and related components.  CCAD maintains a wide range of component test facilities (test cells) necessary to overhaul/repair mechanical, electrical, hy draulic components, instruments, rotor blades, rotor heads, transmissions, gearboxes, and turbo shaft engines.  CCADs capabilities at a glance include Test & Inspection, Metal Processing, and Fabrication & Repair performed by CCAD artisans to support Mult i-Service Weapon System Readiness. d. Soldier Survivability.  N/A   e. Logistics Support.  Logistics support will be provided as part of an Integrated Logistics Support team consisting of U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, CCAD, and the appropriate industry partner.  Logistics support includes, but is not limited to, planning of requirements, implementing standards and initiatives, and overseeing mission requirements.     f. Operational Environment.  Operations for the requirement will take place at the CCAD maintenance facility.   g. Transportation.  N/A 6. Joint Potential Designator.  This is a Total Army program; therefore joint management is not required.  Attachment A Department of the Army U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898 Request for Information (RFI) to the Aviation Maintenance Industry: Attached is the approved Mission Needs Statement and draft requirement document for the establishment of an overhaul program for the T-62T-2B Auxiliary Power Unit at Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD).

<DESC>THIS IS NOT SOLICITATION. The government is preparing to field a decontaminant packet that will be carried in soldiers pockets that has a limited service life, depending on temperature.  At normal storage temperatures (86F), it will last for the five  years that is prescribed on the packaging.  At higher temperatures the service life decreases.  This Request For Information (RFI) solicits information on potential Time Temperature Indicators (TTI) that will measure and track varying temperatures above n ormal storage and will display an indicator when cumulated excessive time/temperature ranges have been exceeded.  The temperature measurements are:  at 104 degrees F the product remains good for 18 months, at 122 degrees F the product remains good for 2 mo nths, at 140 degrees F the product remains good for 1 months and at 160 degrees F the product remains good for 1 month.  A suitable response to this RFI would be to present a TTI capability to meet the above objectives, a schedule for providing the propose d TTI, and a physical/performance specification of the product (functionality, durability, weight, dimensions etc.).

<DESC>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration

TYPE 1 DIABETES TRIALNET MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL 
OF THE EFFECTS OF METABOLIC CONTROL ON PROGRESSION OF TYPE 1 DIABETES

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaborations with Industry to provide insulin infusion pumps (CSIIs)  and continuous blood glucose monitors for use in a NIH-sponsored multi-center trial to evaluate the effects of intensive metabolic control in newly-diagnosed type 1 diabetes using a glucose sensor-insulin infusion pump closed-loop system at the onset of diabetes followed by continuous real-time glucose monitoring associated with continuous insulin infusion therapy. 

INTRODUCTION:

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning to conduct a multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tight metabolic control from diagnosis of type 1 diabetes on preservation of endogenous insulin production as measured by stimulated C-peptide.  The trial will be conducted by investigators participating in the NIDDK sponsored TrialNet consortium. Study aims are to (1) determine if early and sustained restoration of metabolic control improves C-peptide production in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes compared to patients receiving routine diabetes management, and (2) to ascertain whether allowing surviving islet cells to be less metabolically active will impact the underlying autoimmune process of type 1 diabetes.

The TrialNet Metabolic Control Study will enroll 108 patients, age 3-20 years, with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.  Two-thirds of those enrolled will be randomized to the experimental treatment group while the other one-third will be randomized to standard treatment.  Patients assigned to the experimental treatment group will have their insulin administered using a glucose sensor-insulin infusion pump closed-loop system within one week of diagnosis.  If admitted for ketoacidosis, the closed-loop will begin when meals are initiated.  The closed-loop system will consist of a subcutaneous glucose sensor with insulin pump for intravenous or subcutaneous insulin delivery.  On discontinuing the closed-loop system, patients will be started on continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring in real time in conjunction with an insulin infusion pump.  Patients assigned to standard treatment will receive standard treatment for newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.  Study subjects will be enrolled over a one year period and then followed for two years.  Primary outcome is the effect of tight metabolic control on the maintenance of the C-peptide area under the curve in response to a mixed meal at one year following enrollment and secondary outcomes will include the effect of metabolic control on immunologic assays relevant to type 1 diabetes.

STUDY GOAL:  The goal of this study is to determine whether intensive metabolic control of type 1 diabetes from the time of diagnosis preserves residual ?? cell function and therefore insulin secretion, improving blood glucose control and decreasing the negative short- and long-term consequences of hyperglycemia.  

CAPABILITY STATEMENT:  The Collaborator Capability Statements?? received in response to this announcement will be reviewed by a Selection Committee.  The Committee will utilize the information provided in the ??Collaborator Capability Statements?? received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed ten (10) pages of narrative (not including appendices) and should address all of the following selection criteria:

1.	Must provide evidence that the devices intended for use in the TrialNet metabolic control study have been issued a PMA, 510K or exemption registration number from the FDA.
2.	Must provide most recently approved package inserts for such devices.
3.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of device(s) according to a mutually agreed upon schedule for the duration of the TrialNet metabolic control study to be conducted by TrialNet.
4.	Must be prepared to supply their device(s) for immediate use in the TrialNet metabolic control study.
5.	Must agree to have data collection and analysis performed by the TrialNet Coordinating Center (TNCC).
6.	Provide the complete adverse event profile from human studies of the device(s).
7.	Agree to share (with TrialNet) all unexpected serious adverse experience safety data from other studies involving their device(s).
8.	Agree to have their device(s) used in conjunction with other device(s) used in the TrialNet metabolic control study.
9.	Agree to having their device(s) used at all TrialNet study sites involved in the metabolic control study, including those in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
10.	The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results.
11.	Must include a description of the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.

For the In-Hospital Closed Loop System:  

1.	The system should have a continuous glucose sensor (CGS) which communicates with either a computer or hand-held device (PDA).  The computer or device must contain an algorithm for determining insulin delivery based on the CGS signal (absolute value and rate of change) and must then communicate the information to a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump.
2.	The sensor should have accuracy with a MARD of <15% excluding glucose values used to calibrate the device.
3.	The algorithm should have been previously tested in human subjects with at least 500 hours of viable clinical data.

For the Out-Patient (Home) Real Time CGS Augmented Insulin Infusion Pump System:

1.	The real-time CGS should provide data in real time with rate of change information and alarms for hyper- and hypoglycemia.
2.	The insulin infusion pump should calculate insulin doses based on carbohydrate to insulin ratios and insulin sensitivity factors.
3.	The information from the CGS and insulin infusion pump needs to be downloadable into an integrated database for the subject to review glucose trends and patterns in association with their insulin doses and carbohydrate intake.  This data must be able to be viewed by subjects and study staff on a study website.    
4.	The information from the CGS and insulin infusion pump should be analyzable by a computer program which recognizes patterns and then provides study staff with recommendations for changes in insulin therapy which can then be communicated to the patient.
5.	The Collaborator must be willing to work with the TrialNet Biostatistics Coordinating Center (BSC) to assure that the data generated by the CGS and insulin infusion pump is in a format compatible with the BSC database.   

Potential Industry Collaborators can provide some or all of the devices to be used during the TrialNet Metabolic Control study.  Three to six TrialNet sites will conduct the study, and each site will need sufficient complete closed-loop apparatus for the study of two subjects simultaneously.  In addition, the TrialNet sites will need to provide the components of the open-loop system to approximately 108 study subjects.  

Potential Collaborators should submit a brief capability statement to the contact person noted below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) into which the selected Collaborator is expected to enter is an agreement designed to enable a collaboration between Government laboratories and industry. IT IS NOT A GRANT, AND IS NOT A CONTRACT FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF GOODS OR SERVICES. The NIH is prohibited from transferring funds to a CTA collaborator.

<SUBJECT>A -- Navy Product Data Initiative Prospective Participants Conference
<DESC>Prospective Participants Conference.  The National Shipbuilding Research Program has scheduled a Navy Product Data Initiative (NPDI) Prospective Participants Conference on 29 and 30 March 2007.  The Navy Product Data Initiative (NPDI) objective is to develop a consensus specification for Integrated Product Data Environments (IPDE) which will be called out in future Navy acquisition and service life support contracts.  The overall goal is to stimulate the implementation of product data systems based on an open architecture that have the capability to manage Naval ship product data throughout the ship?s lifecycle.

Background:  Individual ship acquisitions programs spend substantial sums on software (Integrated Product Data Environments) intended to streamline ship development and construction processes.  Much of the spending is for ?integration? based on proprietary or ad-hoc interface specifications.  The high cost of Naval shipbuilding and the high cost of IPDE provision under past practices mandate a more effective and efficient approach for future ship acquisition and service life support programs.  
The Navy requested that the National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) develop an Industry-wide approach to a more effective IPDE for ship acquisition and service life support programs.  The NSRP assembled an industry planning team in response to the Navy?s request.  NPDI is a four-phased Navy/industry shipbuilding enterprise effort to address the problem described above and achieve the end state described below.  In a Phase 0 effort, the Planning Group developed the initiative.  Phase 1 is a five month planning effort.  Phase 2 is an approximately one-year effort: 
o	to develop a Navy IPDE specification to be invoked in future shipbuilding and ship repair contracts,
o	to develop a verification mechanism to measure specification compliance, and
o	for stakeholders to plan for implementation.
Phase 3 is the implementation phase.  The Integrated Product Data Environments implemented as a result of this initiative shall be consistent with recent guidance provided by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition (ASN(RDA)) on the implementation of Open Architecture throughout the Navy Enterprise.
The Prospective Participant Conference (PPC) is a key event at the conclusion of Phase 1.  The conference will bring together the various stakeholders in the Navy Shipbuilding Enterprise that are concerned about IPDE development and use.  Attendance will include representatives from the U.S. Navy, shipbuilders, software vendors, and software integrators.  The PPC will include discussions on the initial plans and scope of NPDI.  It is intended to be an open forum with the following objectives:
o	Develop a consensus on the feasibility of this effort;
o	Identify any barriers to development and implementation;
o	Identify required resources, and 
o	Review the Concept of Operations under which the NPDI will operate.
In order to meet the objectives stated above, the attendees of the PPC will be asked to provide input, advice, suggestions, etc. on: 
o	Methodology to develop and implement the IPDE specification
o	Verification and validation methodology
o	Collaborative work environment for specification development
o	Constraints
o	Terms and Conditions of participation
o	Agreement on intellectual property rights
o	Handling of proprietary data
During IPDE Specification Development (Phase 2) Vendors will be encouraged to provide both ongoing feedback from reviewing the working specification and detailed feedback at each formal review. Vendors will also be asked to provide input on issues related to the NPDI IPDE specification or implementation.
Software Vendors and Integrators who may be interested in attending the Prospective Participants Conference may obtain additional information by contacting Larry Karns at ATI, email karns@aticorp.org.

<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

STANDARD COMPETITION TENTATIVE DECISION ANNOUNCEMENT  

MAXWELL AFB SOFTWARE SERVICES FUNCTION 

The 42d Air Base Commander, Col. Peter Costello III, of AETC has announced a tentative performance decision of Software Services.  Competition between agency tender and contract performance determined Software Engineering Services, 1311 South Fort Crook Road, Suite 100, Bellevue NE, 68005  performance to be the most efficient and cost effective method of operation.  This competition affects a total of 30 DoD personnel 0 officers, 16 enlisted, 14 civilians, and 16 Contract Manpower Equivalents.  

This standard competition was conducted in compliance with the Air Force policies in AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, which implements the Office of Management and Budget Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities.  This Circular reaffirms the Government?s policy to rely on the private sector for commercial products and services.  When in-house performance of commercial activities is not required for national defense reasons and contracting is more cost effective, conversion to contract performance is in the best interest of the American taxpayer.

When a competition between an agency and contract performance determines contracting is more cost effective, OMBC A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation require the contractor to offer adversely affected civilian and NAF employees the Right of First Refusal for employment openings to positions (under the contract) for which they are qualified.  Since DoD is sensitive to the personal impact this action may have on civilian employees, the DoD Program for Stability of Civilian Employment ensures every effort is made to help adversely affected civilian employees who desire placement assistance.  These employees may register in the Defense-wide computerized Priority Placement Program.  Registrants under this program receive placement rights to vacancies within DoD (other Federal agencies are also solicited).  When adversely affected civilian employees must relocate to continue Federal employment, transportation and moving expenses are paid by the Government.

This work should be continued to determine if the high strength and excellent properties can be successfully produced in large diameter rod stock with acceptable levels of residual stress for full scale kinetic energy penetrators.  As the strength increases in these alloys, there is a necessary increase i n residual stress if conventional heat treat and quench processes are used. A new two stage quench process may reduce the residual stress from quenching and produce full scale rods with fewer tendencies for quench cracks and delayed quench cracks.  This wo rk addresses this goal using new alloys, known as stakalloy, referenced in US Patent 6726876.  C.2 REQUIREMENTS:   C.2.1 Fabrication of Currently Available Material: At its facility, the Contractor has material previously alloyed as Heat V018 rods under Contract DAAE30-00-D-1010.

Using materials from C.2.1, the Contractor shall develop a heat treatment process that minimizes residual stress in rods using a two-stage quench process.  	b.  The Contractor shall experiment with geometric and power setting parameters to control the new two-stage quench with aim of optimizing the process to produce material with minimum residual stress and optimum mechanical properties. C.2.3 Communications:  The Contractor shall determine the exact number of items required in C.2.1-2 and the exact number of trials to optimize the process or material.  The Contractor shall provide its plan to execute this contract with the Contracting Officers Representative ( COR) and Alternate COR in weekly phone communication as the work develops/progresses and prior to executing any of the effort.

<DESC>1)	Question: Can an extension be granted?
ANSWER: The response date is hereby extended to March 23, 2007.
  
2)	Question: Can the government provide a schematic for the T-R switch at this time? ANSWER: No.
 
3)	Question: The 240ks/sec sample rate is excessive for the 60kHz BW. Is this for future use? 
ANSWER: The governments objective is to oversample the complex frequency- and phase-modulated signals by at least 4x. 

4)	Question: Can the pre-amps and T-R switches be located more than 0.5 meters away if all specifications are met? 
ANSWER: No, Reference specifications paragraph 2.1. 

5)	Question: What acoustic calibrations are required?  TVR and receive sensitivity vs frequency?  Beampatterns? Are they required to be performed at a US Navy calibration facility? 
ANSWER: Reference specs section 4.1(f), TVR curves shall be traceable to a U.S.  Government reference standard. 

6)	Question: Will the maximum transmit record length always be less than or equal to 30 seconds? 
ANSWER: Reference specs Section 2.1 3rd paragraph. 

7)	Question: Please confirm that the system must allow each channel to transmit a different (or phase shifted) waveform. 
ANSWER: Reference Specs Section 2.4.1(a). 

8)	Question: Are post amp gain changes required on a channel-by-channel basis, globally, or both? 
ANSWER: Both, Reference Specs Section 2.4.2(b).

9)	Question: Specification paragraph 4.1.c, is titled Receive Channel-to-Channel Uniformity, but the description of the test appears to be a passband flatness requirement.  Please clarify. 
ANSWER: The receive flatness requirements are specified in para 2.1.  Within this requirement, the channel-to-channel uniformity requirement in para 4.1 must be met. 

10)	  Question: Same question with regards to paragraph 4.1.f. 
  ANSWER: Reference answer for question 8. 
11)	 Question : Please confirm that the Test plan (Spec para 6.0) is not required as part of the proposal. 
 ANSWER: Reference Section 6.0 (c). It would be anticipated that an offeror would address this requirement in their proposal. 

12)	 Question: Para 2.8 requires a buoy power source sufficient for 36 hours of operation.  Para 6.0b expands on this, stating that 40 % of the time (14.4 hrs) the system must output 160 watts acoustic.  However, Para 6.0b does not state what power level the system is in for the other 60% (21.6hrs) of the test.  (Par 2.3 gives two non-transmitting power levels: 120 w (PAs on but not transmitting) and 50 watt (ASRA PC ON, PA?s OFF).   Please clarify. 
ANSWER: The requirement is for a continuous transmit sequence under the conditions specified, alternating between transmitting for 30 seconds and not transmitting for 45 seconds. The governments RMS power estimate is based on 160 W acoustic when transmitting.  The max battery power is calculated on 85% power conversion and 50% transducer conversion, thus 380 watts.  Add the 120 W non-transmit load for a max RMS power estimate of 500 W.  The government desires that the design will be efficient enough that total active power will not exceed 500 W. 60% active plus 40% inactive results in an estimated energy budget of 10 kW-Hr for a 36-hour mission.
 
13)	 Question: Para 7.1indicates this option includes an Electronics Module as well as ASRA array components, yet the referenced section (Para 2.2) does not mention an EM, only the transducer assemblies.  Please clarify what is required under this option. 
ANSWER: ASRA array components include all array-mounted devices and the matching networks.  It allows for mounting some of the components (such as the networks) in the Electronics Module. 

14)	 Question: Para 2.2 requires that the transducer attachment points be moveable up or down 0.5m, which seems to conflict with the array element spacing, which, at 5m aperture could result in one transducer overlapping the adjacent one.  Is this an error? Please clarify. 
ANSWER: The specification is correct.  Overlap is desired. 

15)	 Question: What are the deliverables for CLIN002? 
ANSWER: CLIN 0002 is reference to data deliverables, Reference Specs section 5.0. 

16)	 Question: The terms Array components (Para 7.4) and Array (Para 7.1) can have slightly different meanings depending on the proposed architecture.   When pricing the CLINs, is it correct to assume that the former refers to only the detachable components comprising the array aperture, while the latter refers to the those components PLUS the 100 meter cable?  
ANSWER: Para 7.4 includes the hardware specified in Para 7.1 plus the 100-m cable. 

17)	 Question: Can proposals be emailed? 
ANSWER: No.

<DESC>RFQ Title: Interment Flags Request for Quote (RFQ) #: VA-101-07-RQ-0179 is hereby amended to answer additional questions submitted in response to the solicitation. The time and date specified for receipt of offers is not extended by reason of this modification.  Questions &amp; Answers Question 1: As a "nonmanufactuer" do we qualify to provide a proposal/quote for this requirement if our manufacturer/source has previously provided required Interment flags to the VA under previous contracts? Response: As this solicitation is a total small business set-aside, the successful offeror (s) shall perform at a minimum 51% of the work/services requested. As a "nonmanufacturer" this would be extremely difficult to achieve. In the event you are "nonmanufacturer" and intend to supply another company's Interment Flags, that company shall also be a small business. In this instance offerors shall include the contract number for which that vendor has successfully performed this requirement for the Department. Note: award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding technical standards. Question 2: For Solicitation VA-101-07-RQ-0179 is it possible to bid a lower quantity in early months and then extra flags in the later months or provide the balance of the flags in September or October? For example if&#160;a supplier&#160;offered to do 20,000 flags&#160;in April could they do the&#160;28,669 plus the&#160;additional&#160;8,669 in May? Response: The sole purpose of this solicitation is to replenish rapidly diminishing inventories. As such, it is the intent of the Government to find one or more vendors capable of meeting the monthly requirement identified. Offerors shall propose the quantity of flags for which it has the capacity to provide. In the event a modified delivery schedule will still provide the total number of requested flags within the 6 month timeframe, this could potentially be considered an acceptable alternative. Acceptance of an alternative delivery schedule is largely dependent upon the quantity of flags provided monthly and the offeror's past performance as it pertains to adherence to delivery timelines. If the delivery schedule proposed does not meet the needs of the Department, multiple awards will be issued as identified in the solicitation. Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the solicitation document remain unchanged and in full force.
