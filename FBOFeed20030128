<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to WETLABS Incorporation for the procurement of an AC-9 plus Absorption and Beam Attenuation Meter.  The attenuation meter will be used to augment and upgrade the current suite of optical oceanographic instrumentation of the Coastal Test Range. This equipment replaces older, outdated hardware and software an will allow improve performance for the collection of oceanographic data, specifically the optical water properties of absorption and beam attenuation at nine different wavelengths.   This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. This is the only equipment, for this upgrade, that is 100% backward compatible and easily integrated with existing hardware and software.  This level of compatibility and integration a re required to prevent data loss during at-sea test operations that would be extremely expensive and very difficult to recreate.  Financial and programmatic repercussions of such an occurrence are immeasurable. If different equipment is used, it would increase the overall cost of the effort to the Government.  Such costs would consist of integration of new equipment into the system, training of test range personnel to operate the new equipment, and an extension to the current test schedule of the Coastal Test Range.  NAICS Code 334516.  Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>NA The fiscal year 2003 (FY03) Defense Appropriations Act provides $85 million to the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program (PCRP) to support innovative research directed toward eliminating prostate cancer.  This program is administered by th e US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command through the Office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP). The PCRP is releasing Program Announcements for nine different funding mechanisms in FY03. The name of each funding mechan ism, its Program Announcement release date, and submission deadline are as follows: Exploration-Hypothesis Development Award, Exploration-Resource Development Award,  Health Disparity Research-Prostate Scholar Award, Health Disparity Training-Prostate Scho lar Award, Idea Development Award, New Investigator Award, and Postdoctoral Traineeship Award were all released on 27 January 2003 with a submission deadline of April 16, 2003, 5:00 pm Eastern Time.  Physician Research Training Award was released on 27 Jan uary 2003 with a submission deadline of June 18, 2003, 5:00 pm Eastern Time. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Collaborative Partnership Award will be released in early February 2003 with a submission deadline of June 18, 2003, 5:00 pm Ea stern Time. The three new opportunities from the above mechanisms for prostate cancer research funding this year include: 1. Exploration-Hypothesis Development Awards are intended to support the initial exploration of innovative, untested, potentially grou ndbreaking concepts (with no preliminary data) in prostate cancer.  Innovation is critical to this award and will be the major evaluation criteria., 2. Exploration-Resource Development Awards are intended to support product-driven research aimed at develop ing critical resources needed to advance the field of prostate cancer research.  These resources may include, but are not limited to, development of animal models, cell lines, and reagents., 3. Physician Research Training Awards are intended to prepare phy sicians for careers in prostate cancer research through a mentored training experience. The PCRP electronic Program Announcements have been completely revised for FY03.  Detailed descriptions of each of these funding mechanisms, evaluation criteria, and su bmission requirements can be found in the FY03 PCRP Program Announcement corresponding to that funding mechanism.  Each Program Announcement can be downloaded from the CDMRP web site (http://cdmrp.army.mil).  All applicants will be required to submit one e lectronic version of their proposal as a PDF (portable document format) file. All documents may be downloaded from the CDMRP website. The website also contains further information about the PCRP, PCRP awardees, previous PCRP Program Announcements, and othe r CDMRP-sponsored programs and events. Again the CDMRP web site is located at (http://cdmrp.army.mil). Questions related to the Program, proposal format or required documentation can be addressed to the CDMRP at 301-619-7079, Fax at 301-619-7792 or email a t cdmrp.pa@det.amedd.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>B--BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE BASIC RESEARCH OFFICE (BRO) OF THE U.S. ARMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
<SOLNBR>DASW01-04-K-0001
<RESPDATE>050103
<ARCHDATE>06302003
<CONTACT>Carolyn Baltimore, 703-614-6823
<DESC>NA I. The Basic Research Office (BRO) of the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) solicits new proposals for its fiscal year 2004 contract program of fundamental research in behavioral science. This Broad Agency Announceme nt is issued per FAR 35.016. The purpose of the research is to add new, fundamental knowledge to behavioral science sub-disciplines and discover generalizable principles. Novel and state-of-the-art approaches to difficult problems are especially welcome, as are integrated programmatic  efforts to develop and test theory. A portion of available funding may be made available for meritorious proposals from minority institutions and historically Black colleges and universities, and these entities are encouraged to participate. Investigations that focus on purely physiological mechanisms or psychopathology cannot be considered by this agency; however, neuroscience approaches to memory, cognition, and personality are not excluded. Similarly, no consideration can be given to purely  applied research projects (e.g., human factors studies or applied training programs).  However, support for basic science does depend on the judgment that its research findings will have the potential to stimulate new, applied behavioral technologies with  potential for improving the effectiveness of Army personnel and their units.  The decision to fund a new basic research program consists of two stages.  In the first stage, each proposal is peer reviewed for responsiveness and technical merit by at least two behavioral scientists.  Those proposals that are judged responsive and receive high technical ratings go to the second stage.  In that stage, ARI research unit chiefs are asked whether the research generated by a given proposal, if successful, would be  transitioned to their applied research programs. Proposals that are highly rated and are identified as useful for one or more ARI applied research programs will be given priority for funding.  Proposals that are responsive and receive high technical ratin gs may also be funded but will generally be given a lower priority. II. Scientific Problems for Basic Research.  To meet the transformation objectives of the U.S. Army over the next two decades, the Army must improve its ability to:  (1) Select, train, and/or develop leaders and soldiers who are flexible and adaptable in novel missions and operational situations.  (2 ) Select, train, and/or develop leaders and soldiers to function effectively in digital, information rich, and semi-autonomous environments. (3) Select, train, and/or develop teams that can function collaboratively and effectively when quickly formed and /or operating in distributed, high stress environments.  (4) Accelerate leader development of those skills that usually develop over time only through direct experience.  (5) Select, train, and/or develop leader and soldier interpersonal/intercultural skil ls/attributes that make leaders and soldiers effective in joint-service and multi-national operations.  These needed improvements form the broad perspective of ARIs research objectives.  In keeping with this broad perspective, the areas listed below are o f special interest to ARI.  It is particularly important that proposed basic research describe clearly how it can lead to applied research that would be meaningful to the Army.  Some of our special interest research issues are: A.	Basic ResearchTraining and Learning. 1.	Training in Complex Situations, including factors that enhance transfer of training of the sort of complex tasks performed by Army personnel; the amount of training and feedback required to established sustainable improvements in complex task performanc e; the most effective mixes and sequences of training modes (classroom, live exercises, and simulations) in which complex tasks should be taught; reducing the effects of information overload through training; determining how individuals assign meaning and relevance to  large amounts of ambiguous data being rapidly received, and determine how to improve this ability through training; improving adaptability through training. 2.	Training for semi-autonomous/robotic systems including:  if / how multi-tasking can be trained.  What effect, if any, does training have on reducing information overload and to what it extent can it be measured and predicted? 3.	Interpersonal and Group/Team Training, including the incorporation of mentoring and collaborative learning into web-based or distributed learning where team/group members are not familiar with each other and/or group team members may change unexpectedly ; investigating the most effective method of developing interpersonal skills such as communication, negotiation, mediation, emotional intelligence; determining how necessary assessment and feedback is in training interpersonal skills; best approaches to me ntoring/coaching and how can one teach unit commanders such approaches. 4.	Training and Technology, including assessing and addressing the unique training requirements in digital systems; determining the human and training dimensions that affect compliance and/or effectiveness in self-regulated training environments; and under standing and modeling the effectiveness of just in time training. B. Basic ResearchLeadership  1.	Methods for accelerating leader development to include assessment and training methods and devices. 2.	Methods for assessing and developing/training flexibility and adaptability when faced with novel situations. 3.	Assessing the nature of changes, if any, in the leaders role with the introduction of semi-autonomous/robotic systems.  What characteristics will a leader need to possess in order to lead a mixed (human and machine) team, and how will they be measured? 4.	What aspects of leadership will be affected by the existence of dispersed teams? 5.	Self-development, including identifying the types of learning or knowledge that are best handled through self-development; the specific training needs the Army has that are best handled through self-development; the strategies or interventions can the A rmy use to support these and other individual self-development efforts; best approach (es) for self-development (e.g., reflection, web-based training, self-awareness toolkits) including the question of whether it is possible and practical for leaders to se lf-develop the interpersonal skills through distance learning; determining whether self-development has to occur in isolation or also as a social process  as part of a team. 6.	Generational Differences in Leaders. Recent research has explored generational differences along various dimensions, e.g., values, communication, self-directed activities, organizational commitment, technology, and interpersonal relations.  More specifi cally, military studies have addressed the issue of junior officer attrition and have identified and discussed the disparity between senior and junior officers in terms of generational differences. We are interested in a more valid understanding of how the se generations differ and how these specific differences impact processes and outcomes important to the Objective Force (e.g., team-building, self-development, leader teams). 7.	Leadership Selection, including determining the interpersonal skills that are essential for Objective Force leaders and how one selects for them; the limits of self-management skill and self-directed learning for Objective Force leaders, how they relate  to Objective Force skill requirements, how one differentiates them from traditional constructs and what new assessment measures can measure them; the predictors for strong self-awareness and successful self-development, how best to evaluate the impact of self-awareness and self-development efforts for Objective Force leadership. 8.	A better understanding of the relationship between adult learning and growth in leadership ability.  Most adult learning research that has fo cused on young college students who are, at best, immature adults. Additional research is needed to explore the applicability of these principles to mature adults in their 30s and 40s. C. Basic Research  Human Resource Practices 1.	General Selection, including identifying the aptitude and skill requirements that are specific to the Objective Force soldier; assessing how persistence and dependability develop and contribute to effective performance and job tenure, how they relate to  job factors, and how individual differences in such processes can be measured; the extent to which practical intelligence is a function of an aptitude that cuts across domains and how to develop a method for measuring this aptitude; how to anticipate chan ge and develop performance measures for Objective Force soldiers for tasks that are not currently known.  2.	Selection specific to the semi-autonomous/robotic requirements of the Objective force including:  What characteristics should a soldier as an operator possess?  How do you select for multi-tasking and decision making ability?  What utility, if any, does  flexibility/adaptability to change have for operator selection? What metrics and criteria should be used for selecting and assigning operators?

Identifying factors that influence retention decision making, productive behavior, and go od citizenship and modeling how they develop.  This research should consider the nature of mediators such as values and ethics, personal motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment in this process.   D. Basic Research Social Structures The Army does not exist in a vacuum. It is a component of the overall societal system and is affected by changes in that system. We wish to support research leading to a more valid understanding of military environment, including how major societal conditi ons and trends, changing Army missions, and Army culture influence recruitment, personnel retention, morale, cohesion, discipline, and military performance.  We need to know how to achieve organizational change without severe adverse personnel effects as a pplied to the process of the Army transformation.  This research should result in models that consider the role of personal involvement by members at all organizational levels in successfully implementing change.   E. Basic Research Cognition The Army is interested in basic research on cognitive functioning, particularly as it affects the requirements of the Objective Force, as follows: 1.	What are the individual differences in cognition that affect the saturation point of information from unmanned systems and how many robots/semi-autonomous vehicles one operator can manage? 2.	Cognitive Functioning, including the individual processes that characterize more effective team performance; a better understanding of the growth of expertise in performance of complex tasks.  3.	What are the input-output cues that lead to effective collective skill development?  What are the cognitive factors that facilitate or impair team formation and contribute to a sense of trust?   What are principles for developing shared mental models th at influence understanding the commanders intent and team performance?  What are the effects of a technologically rich, digital environment on a leaders ability to make decisions, convey intent, adapt quickly, build teams, and resist stress?   4.	What are the relationships, if any, between pattern recognition and fluid intelligence, flexibility, and/or adaptivity?  If applicable, what practical, measures of pattern recognition can be shown to be predictive of fluid intelligence, flexibility, and /or adaptivity? III. Time, Personnel, and Other Features of the Research. Historically, basic research contracts have ranged between one and four years, with a median of three years.  The median three-year basic research contract cost has been $490,000 in recent years.  Proposals may be for a complete research effort or formulat ed as one or more options that will be exercised by ARI if early results are promising. Short-term, small-scale efforts in high-risk/high-gain areas are also welcome. Finally, investigators are encouraged to conduct their basic research in realistic contex ts, where appropriate. Both single-investigator and collaborative research efforts are acceptable, as are multidisciplinary approaches to a central problem. Collaborative efforts may involve researchers at a single institution or in cooperating institutions. Offerors with questions about the suitability of their planned research may send e-mail or call (less preferred method) the relevant in-house research unit chief(s). However, use of e-mail is optional and not a secure method of communication. For help in l ocating the appropriate research unit chief(s), contact either of the BRO program managers listed at the end of this BAA.  Again, e-mail is the preferred contact medium.  The government is not responsible for technical difficulties or disclosures resulting  from e-mail communications. IV. Application Procedures. Proposals shou ld include an abstract and be sufficiently detailed to be responsive to the criteria, described below, for evaluation. Please include an e-mail address and telephone number where technical questions can be addressed. The formal proposal must include instit utional endorsement, signature of the proposed principal investigator, time frames for all phases of the project, and detailed accounts of proposed work and budget. The background and technical sections of the formal proposal must be no greater than 25 pag es in length, single-spaced. Additional materials may include budget, vitae, references, and institutional information. Five copies must be submitted. Scientific peers will review the proposals according to the following dimensions in order of importance:  (1) Importance of the research to ARI's mission and Army concerns. (2) Technical merit, appropriateness, and feasibility of the proposed approach. (3) Scientific significance of the issue and originality. (4) The qualifications, capabilities, and experien ce of the proposed principal investigator and key personnel, and institutional resources and facilities. Each dimension will be given a letter grade between A and F.  A-Outstanding, of the highest quality; B-Good, but could be improved; C-Average; D-Below average and not adequate; E-Totally inadequate and without merit. Those proposals with very low importance to ARI and the Army will be unable to recover even with high grades on other dimensions.  Technical merit is significantly more important than dimens ions 3 or 4.  Scientific significance is somewhat more important than qualifications.  Moreover, successful proposals must propose costs that are both affordable and realistic for the proposed effort. The evaluation of proposed cost is subordinate to the t echnical evaluation.  Also, past performance, prior research, and research and development contracts to include timely completion and cost effectiveness will be considered. A research proposal should contain the following sections:  Proposal Cover Page, Abstract, Background, Technical Approach, References, Resumes of proposed researchers, and Budget. Proposal Cover Page:  The cover page should include the following:  Data Uni versal Numbering System (DUNS) #, Standard Industrial Classifications (SIC) #, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) #, Taxpayer Identification (TIN) #, and Name and Type of  Organization (Educational, Commercial or Non-Profit). Abstract. The abstract sh ould be one page or less. It should describe the problem underlying the research, the hypothesis being tested, explain the objective of the proposal, and provide a condensed, but meaningful description of the technical approach.  It is very important that in the abstract and in the body of the proposal, the author makes quite clear how this basic research, if successful, could lead to applied research in areas dealt with by ARI.   Background. The background should include a description of the problem, as the proposal author understands it. It is helpful if the author shows an understanding of the Army and ARI contexts that apply to the proposed research. The description of the probl em should be tied to an account of significant previous and current research that is applicable. Clearly, there will not be enough space to write a critical, annotated bibliography, but the author should demonstrate meaningful knowledge of the background o f the research that is being proposed. Technical Approach. This is a critical part of the proposal and it should be responsive to the listed criteria. It should include a description of the hypothesis upon which the research is to be based, the goal of that research, and a detailed account of h ow the research is to be done. This account should be much like the methods section of a research paper. It should include a description of the data to be collected, the methods for collecting the data, the number and source of subjects and how they will b e acquired, and the pr oposed research design and likely analysis methods. It is possible that an intermediate or final product of research might include training packages, simulation models, or other software-based devices. In this case, the author should show how such a produc t relates to the hypothesis being tested and should provide sufficient detail to permit understanding and evaluation.  The technical approach should include a statement that includes the major tasks to be performed and products to be produced.  In the case  of a one-year proposal, the statement should be divided by quarters of the year.  In the case of multi-year proposals, it should be divided by year.  References. This should be a list of all the references called out in the body of the proposal. It should not include publications that are not referred to in the body. It should be in American Psychological Association format. Resums. Resums or vitae should be included for all proposed researchers with special emphasis on the Principal Investigator(s). It is particularly important that the resumes include those publications that bear on the research being proposed.  Budget. This should be a typical budget section as is required by other federal agencies.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to release Request for Proposal (RFP) N00039-02-R-0016 for a replacement system for the existing Clarinet MERLIN Receiving System (CMRS).  This effort will include the production, integration, testing, installation, documentation and maintenance of the entire CMRS including the antenna, receiver, communications system to the Broadcast Control Authority (BCA), and the operator interface/display. The present CMRS is a shore based receiving system that monitors transmissions from the Submarine Emergency Communication Transmitter (SECT) buoys (AN/BST-1) launched from SSBN submarines.  The receiver sites are strategically located at six sites, three covering the Atlantic Ocean and three covering the Pacific Ocean.   In addition, one or more MERLIN receivers (based on the proposed CMRS) may be ordered for the TACAMO aircraft and the land based STRATCIMMWING ONE communications center.  SPAWAR anticipates awarding a single Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract in fiscal year 2003, incorporating Fixed-Price Line Items, with hardware deliveries over an approximate three-year period followed by maintenance periods of up to a total of five years. A Statement of Objectives (SOO) will be provided to prospective offerors. Offerors will be required to provide (i) a Statement of Work (SOW)/specification for the CMRS, (ii) a technical proposal detailing how they will implement and meet the CMRS SOW they have submitted, and (iii) past performance information. The performance requirements for the CMRS are to receive, recognize and decode AN/BST-1 buoy transmissions and deliver the messages to the BCA as soon as possible in certain operational areas and within 24 hours of buoy activation in all operational areas with a 95% minimum probability.  Additional requirements include:  the system shall operate automatically without operator intervention and with minimum operator attention; the system shall be designed for low maintenance, minimum adjustment, high reliability, and high end-to-end system availability; the system shall be capable of conducting periodic system checks and continuous Built-In-Tests (BIT) to ensure the receiver is operational; and the system shall be capable of controlling several diversely-located CMRS(s) simultaneously from the BCA.  An offeror must have a SECRET facility clearance to review classified documents referenced in the SOO and contractor personnel must have at least a SECRET clearance to access the BCA. A draft RFP including a draft Statement of Objectives is available at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil under solicitation number N00039-02-R-0016. Click on Business Opportunities; then Headquarters; then Future Opportunity; then click on the yellow folder to the left of N00039-02-R-0016.  The solicitation, when released, will also be posted to the SPAWAR website under Open Solicitations (vs. Future Opportunity) and no other notice will appear in FedBizOpps.  Interested parties are invited to subscribe to the solicitation on the SPAWAR website to ensure they receive any solicitation amendments or notices connected with it. Any interested offeror shall notify the SPAWAR Points-of-Contact (POCs) listed in the last paragraph of this announcement of their name and address (Corporate/Principal Office) as well as the name, telephone number, fax, and e-mail address of their designated point of contact.  Responses shall also indicate the Facility clearance level, e.g., Secret or Top Secret, of the offeror and a POC (name, phone number and/or e-mail address) at the Government activity that issued the Facility clearance. Additionally, interested offerors are requested to notify the SPAWAR Points-of-Contact (POCs) listed in the last paragraph of this announcement as to whether or not a commercial item can satisfy this procurement. Commercial item means- (1) Any item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, and (i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public; (2) Any item that evolved from an item described in paragraph (1) of this definition through advances in technology or performance and that is not yet available in the commercial marketplace, but will be available in the commercial marketplace in time to satisfy the delivery requirements under a Government solicitation; (3) Any item that would satisfy a criterion expressed in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this definition, but for -- (i) Modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace; or (ii) Minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements.

<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, FL intends to solicit Kongsberg Simrad INC., 7225 Lantry, Houston, TX 77040-6625, on a sole source basis for a sonar redesign and software development effort. The effort will rebuild the model 3000m fan-beam sonar as a split head design to facilitate integration with CSS robots.  The design will weigh significantly less that the current commercial version and will be easily mountable on the vehicles.  The effort will also provide CSS with software libraries to control the sonar from the vehicles onboard, embedded computer.  Decision to proceed on a sole-source basis is based on the results of testing of multiple sonar systems that were identified as having the potential to meet the needs of a sonar system that could be mounted on the robots.  This testing identified the model 3000m as having the best perfor mance of all tested models.  The size and weight were prohibitive at the time of testing. Continued monitoring of the market indicates that there are no other sonars that match the performance of the model 3000m.  It is now practical to proceed with the redesign effort to provide a lighter weight, more compact system for evaluation on the robot under conditions more closely matching expected field conditions. Delivery of the software will be within 60 days of award and the hardware within 12 months after the date of contract award.  Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 334511 applies. Size standard is 750 employees. FSC is 5845.

<DESC>It is the intent of National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole source basis from History Associates Inc., Rockville, MD, for archival and digital archival services.  History Associates Inc. (HAI) has provided expert archival services to the NLM during the three years of the Digital Manuscripts Program.  The staff has considerable experience working with National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists, including conducting interviews and appraising manuscripts collections.  All personnel have security clearances, which further qualifies the staff to work with the papers of NIH scientists and complex government records.  The Digital Manuscripts Program has a two-fold purpose: 1) appraisal and acquisition of papers of eminent scientists in the field of biomedicine, and 2) preservation and access to such papers via digital technology.  The project has high visibility, involving prominent scientists in the field of biomedicine, as well as documenting the history of major scientific discoveries at NIH and elsewhere.  A key element of this project is an oral history component involving interview sessions and ongoing collaborations with donors throughout.  This project therefore requires several levels of archival expertise including experience with oral history methods, processing of federal scientists' papers, and digital archival projects.  HAI has successfully accomplished numerous projects for the History of Medicine Division, NLM, and especially its Modern Manuscripts Collections, over the past 10 years, including a 1997 pilot project to study the feasibility of implementing digital technology as an enhancement to accessing historical sources in the manuscripts collections. The HAI staff currently employed on the Digital Manuscripts Program have been intricately involved in the design and development of the program since its inception and therefore the staff is knowledgeable and skilled in this type of work.  These skills are critical to the ongoing continuity of the program.  HAI possesses intimate knowledge of and familiarity with NLM's systems and processes that allow them to begin productive work immediately. This allows NLM to avoid the weeks or months of training and orientation required to bring another company up to speed.  HAI employs certified archivists at the project management level and at the supervisory archivist level, which ensures that national standards of archival practice will be applied to all work accomplished. This is a critical requirement for this project, since it is during this stage of transition to a new technology that such standards of practice must be applied.  Furthermore, because of the high profile of donors contributing to this program, contract personnel must have a Masters in Library Science or related graduate level degree or combined experience of at least five years in an archival setting, as well as experience with oral history interviewing. HAI has demonstrated experience in each of these areas, as well as an established reputation in the field of archival management. HAI personnel are highly-trained, Academy of Certified Archivists (ACA) Certified Archivists or equivalent. Their professional experience is critical for effective performance of this technically innovative project. HAI has consistently delivered high quality products at competitive labor rates with cost-effective program management. HAI has a record of timely compliance with reporting requirements and provides written documentation of current processing and evaluation procedures.  Additionally, the project requires close collaboration with donors, curators, and digital project staff on a daily basis.  Availability on short notice and timely responsiveness to the day-to-day needs of the program throughout the length of this purchase order are essential requirements.  Interviews have been previously carried out with key donors to this project through the HAI oral history program.  This background uniquely prepares HAI for an understanding of historical events and subjects pertinent to this project and for developing selection criteria determining materials appropriate for digitization.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>Coronado National Forest, Tucson, Arizona, is soliciting for construction service with design build capability to provide design and construction services for renovation of a picnic area and trailhead, road construction and reconstruction, construction of a restroom, and other improvements in Madera Canyon, located in the Santa Rita Mountains 45 miles south of Tucson. Elevation at the site is 5,500 feet. 

This proposed procurement is Unrestricted, open to both large and small business concerns, NAICS 234990, size standard $17M. Estimated cost of construction is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. Procurement will be through a Two-Phase Design-Build RFP. In accordance with FAR Subpart 36.3 one solicitation will be issued covering both phases. Proposals will be evaluated in Phase One to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase Two. One contract will be awarded using competitive negotiation. 
Phase One of the solicitation shall include the scope of work; the phase-one evaluation factors, including technical approach (but not detailed design or technical information); 
technical qualifications, such as specialized experience and technical competence; capability to perform; past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members); and other appropriate factors excluding cost or price related factors. A maximum of five most highly qualified offerors will be selected to submit Phase Two proposals, which shall contain both technical and price proposals to be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. 

The project includes: 1.  Design: completion of field surveys, hydrology calculations, preliminary designs, and preparation of construction documents (including site plans, details, supplemental specifications if needed, detailed schedule of items) and cost estimates.  2.  Construction: demolition of existing facilities, modification of existing facilities, and construction of new facilities.  Major construction elements include roads, earthwork, retaining walls, parking areas, a restroom building, picnic sites, pedestrian paths, concrete pavement, and trailheads.

A design concept drawing and initial specifications, and an aerial survey of the site will be provided to the Contractor who must work closely with a Forest Service Engineer and Landscape Architect to complete design work and construction.  Information within the description will indicate existing elements to remain, items to be modified, and new facilities needed. Conceptual sketches will show recommended locations of facilities, however, the Contractor designer will be required to visit the project site and become familiar with the area, its natural setting, site features, visitor needs, accessibility, and susceptibility to wildfire and flood. Design considerations and existing landscape features must be integrated so that construction impacts are minimized and natural form, color, and material characteristics are incorporated and highlighted. The Contractor design team will receive periodic input from a Forest Service design team (landscape architect, engineer, and a recreation specialist) with the expectation of establishing a communicative and cooperative relationship for the term of the contract. The Contractor designer will provide a preliminary, then a final design with Government approval of all design decisions prior to construction and with all designs becoming property of the Government. 

A 270-day contract is anticipated for the Mt. Wrightston Trailhead project (90 days design, 180 days construction) with an anticipated start work date for design of May 12, 2003. 

Issue date of this RFP is scheduled for February 12, 2003 with Phase One proposals due no later than close of business March 14, 2003.  A scope of work, a conceptual drawing, Phase One and Phase Two evaluation factors, and instructions to offerors for submittal of Phase One technical proposals are included in the solicitation package and are available upon request from the Contracting Office, Coronado National Forest, 300 W. Congress, Tucson, AZ  85701.  No later than the issue date of the RFP, contact the Contracting Office via FAX (520-670-4532) in order to receive a copy of the Phase One solicitation package.

<DESC>The National Cancer Insitute(NCI), Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB), intends on entering into a sole source contract with Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., 117 Great Valley Parkway, Malvern, PA 19355 for the analysis/validation of differential protein profiles due to benzene exposure.  The overall goal of the study is to validate and reproduce findings from a previous study among 10 exposed and 10 unexposed subjects that identified specific perturbations in protein levels in serum among benzene exposed subjects.  Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., is the only mass spectrometer source known to the NCI that has an operating system that is capable of profiling protein patterns in biological fluids using samples of limited volume (Ciphergen ProteinChip System; patented (No. 5,719,060 & 5,894,063).  There are other techniques run by other mass spectrometer companies which require much larger amounts of biological material and lack sophisticated software to spot differences or patterns in complex protein mixtures.  These techniques are therefore deemed not suitable for the important and novel research questions on differential protein patterns among benzene exposed workers.  In addition, to previous performed analyses, it is of imperative importance that the obtained data on protein profiles is comparable between both studies.  Great importance as it is intended to pool all data for the final statistical analyses and therefore both sets of data need to be absolutely comparable.  This can only be achieved by running the samples at exactly the same conditions in order to control for any differences in laboratory techniques or other unknown sources of variation.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EST (Local Washington, DC time) on February 4, 2003.   This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 541990.

<DESC>Customs is issuing a non-competitive order to Integrated System Diagnostics (ISD) to perform the required SW CMM appraisal support to meet Customs Modernization Office (CMO) required milestone dates.  Current CMO project milestones call for the eCP SW CMM appraisal to be conducted in Feb. 2003.  During this appraisal up to four existing eCP projects will be used as the basis for the SW CMM appraisal.  Thee existing projects will be projects from eCP partnership companies.  ISD has conducted SW CMM appraisals at each of these 3 companies.  This SW CMM appraisal experience will reduce the effort required prior to the actual CMO SW CMM appraisal in Feb 2003, thus reducing the overall effort required for the eCP SW CMM appraisal.   There will be no extensive learning curve required for ISD to prepare fo the actual eCP assessment activity.    Additionally, it is believed that no other existing SW CMM appraisal organization has the prerequisite background knowledgge of the existing eCP projects that will enable them to meet the Feb 2003 date for  conducting the eCP SW CMM appraisal.    Based on market research, a number of firms were found capable of performing SW CMM appraisal, but were not capable of meeting the CMO Feb 2003 date for conducting the eCP SW CMM Appraisal.  ISD will perform task 1- pre-appraisal consulting services; task 2- c onduct appraisal using SCE structured methodology; and task 3- product a final written report with the appraisal results.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue a sole-source, no-cost purchase order to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 330, Marina del Rey, CA 90292. The period of performance for this effort will be three years, with a six month base period, two one-year options, and one six month option. The Government will award this purchase order on April 1, 2003. The Contractor shall support the operation of the Internet by performing three interdependent, technical coordinating  functions, known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions.  First, the Contractor shall coordinate the assignment of technical protocol parameters.  This function involves the review and assignment of unique values to numerous parameters (e.g., operation codes, port numbers, object identifiers, protocol numbers) used in various Internet protocols.  This function also includes dissemination of listings of assigned parameters through various means (including on-line publication) and the review of technical documents for consistency with assigned values.  Second, the Contractor shall perform administrative functions associated with root management.  This function primarily involves facilitation and coordination of the root zone of the domain name system (DNS).  It includes receiving requests for and making routine updates of the country code top level domain contact and name server information. Third, the Contractor shall provide overall responsibility for the allocation of IPv4 and IPv6 delegations of IP address space.  This function includes delegation of IP address blocks to regional registries for routine allocation, typically through downstream providers, to Internet end-users within the regions served by those registries.  It also includes reservation and direct allocation of space for special purposes, such as multicast addressing, addresses for private networks, and globally specified applications. This procurement is being conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - only one responsible source, which applies when the services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of service will satisfy the agency's needs.  The Department of Commerce continues to transition technical management of the Internet Domain Names System to the private sector.  This process began during June 1998 when the Department of Commerce issued a Statement of Policy: Management of Internet Names and Addresses, 63 Fed. Reg. 31741 (1998) in which it indicated that the U.S. Government would continue to participate in the technical management of the DNS during the transition to maintain Internet stability and continuity of services. On November 25, 1998, the Department of Commerce, through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and ICANN entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) through which the parties are jointly designing, developing and testing the mechanisms, methods, and procedures that should be in place and the steps necessary to transition DNS management to the private sector.  As set forth in the Statement of Policy and the MOU, the original target date for completing the transition to private sector management was September 30, 2000.  While significant progress has been made towards the transition, some work remains to be completed. Part of this transition process relates to the continued performance of the critical Internet technical coordinating functions, collectively known as the IANA functions.  These functions were previously performed under contract between the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the University of Southern California (USC) as  part of a research project known as the Terranode Network Technology (TNT).  As the TNT project neared completion and the DARPA/USC contract neared expiration in 1999, the U.S. Government recognized the need for the continued performance of the IANA functions as vital to the stability and smooth functioning of the Internet. On December 24, 1998, USC entered into a transition agreement with ICANN under which ICANN secured directly from USC, all necessary resources, including key personnel, intellectual property, and computer facility access critical to the continued performance of the IANA functions.  Having assumed these key resources and associated privatization responsibilities under the MOU, ICANN is the only responsible entity that can continue to provide seamless performance of the IANA functions, and thus, maintain the security, stability, and reliability of the Internet.

Offeror's who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirements set forth.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 10-days after publication of this synopsis.

<CONTACT>Captain John M. Haberlach, Contract Specialist, 781-377-5595; Mr. Neil S. Miller, Contracting Officer, 781-377-5584
<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA). This FedBizOps announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) to extend the Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Ground Systems (RIGS) Products and Services, (RPS) contracts to Lockheed Martin and Raytheon under Contract Numbers F19628-97-D-0008 and F19628-97-D-0009; increasing the ordering period and period of performance each by one year.  A NOCA was previously issued and a modification completed to extend the ordering and performance periods of these two contracts.  The new NOCA will extend the ordering period for these contracts from 31 December 2003 to 31 December 2004.  The related period of performance will be extended from 31 December 2004 to 31 December 2005.  There will be no change in the competitively awarded ceiling price.  This extension is needed to support the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) effort for tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination of intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) information.  The Government intends to contract with Raytheon and Lockheed Martin as the only holders of RPS contracts under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  In this case the USAF may deem products and/or services to be available only from the original sources in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized products or services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B)).  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.   Call Captain John M. Haberlach at (781) 377-5595 or email at john.haberlach@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice. See Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR LO2/ETHANOL VACUUM JACKETED TANK AND FEEDSYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received on the subject synopsis/RFQ.  See amendment 1 for questions/answers to 1-23. Q24. Ref SOW Paragraph 1.0: What spare hardware is required other than tank long lead piece parts?	A24: No other spare hardware is required. Other spare hardware will be procured as needed. Q25: Ref SOW Paragraph 1.4: Can we get a better definition of what long lead pieces are desired?  A25: This is at vendor discretion. Long lead shall be defined as any part that is not normally kept in stock. Q26: Reference SOW Paragraph 1.6 and Figure 2: Please define the purpose of the connections requiring AN-KC fittings.	Are these to be drain and or purge ports?  Shall these fittings be capped? Relief protected? Insulated in any manner?  A26: The AN-KC fitting are 1) a liquid fill and drain valve, and 2) a feedsystem outlet.  WSTF will provide relief device and any insulation. The vendor need only provide caps for shipping. Q27: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.7 and 3.2.8: Please define the interface preference for instrumentation such as pressure transducers and thermocouples.	Will NASA wire directly to the pressure transducers for remote indication or shall the Skid/Tank/Piping assembly include a junction box to which these devices shall wired for interface.  This same question applies to valves.  Does NASA intend to connect the actuator signal wires to each of the individual valves or do NASA desire that all of the valves be wired to a junction box for interface with remote controls.	A27: There is no preference in that NASA WSTF can adapt to the vendor standard practice for the instruments. NASA WSTF will install and wire the pressure transducers and actuator signal wires. The port for the pressure transducers is TBD but could be a  AN fitting. The vendor shall provide a description of the thermocouple connector on the vacuum jacketing. Q28: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.7, 3.2.6 & 3.2.7:  These paragraphs require ports for pressure relief and high point bleeds however the specifications do not mention any requirements for relief valve or bleed valves.  Are there any requirements for relief valves and bleed valves?   A28: The relief valves and bleed valves will be procured and installed separately at WSTF. Q29: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.9, 3.4.14 & DWGSDN24-100274: Is carbon steel A36 acceptable for the secondary support structure, as indicated on the drawing?   A29: Carbon steel A36 is acceptable. NASA-STD-5008 should be followed for protective coating. Q30: Ref SOW Paragraph 1.16:  Please describe the "test article" which requires pressure drop testing.  Does this imply measuring the pressure drop across the piping, valves and accumulator?  What is the required flow rate for the pressure drop test?  What is the acceptability criteria?  What is the Cv for the accumulator?  What are the points of measurement?  A30: The pressure drop test is to ensure that nothing is blocking the lines after final assembly. The test can be performed using a method and acceptability criteria recommended by the vendor.  The GFE accumulator housing provided by NASA will include a bypass manifold that allows flow to go through lines with actually flowing into the accumulator, so a CV is not required for the accumulator. Q31: Ref SOW Paragraph 2.2:  Please provide copies of NASA & MSFC Specifications, including MSFC-SPEC-164, MSFC-SPEC-222, NASA-STD-5008, MSFC-STD-486 & NASA-STD-5005a.

Standard 1" vent line with 1" dual relief system or sizing criteria for us that we can calculate.  <P> A32: The fill was intended to be bottom fill, but vendor can recommend design. A standard full trycock can be proposed in addition to instrumentation. Information for vent and relief system sizing will be provided at contract start. <P> Q33: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.5:  Is the dp sensor to be an indication device only (dp guage) or an electronic transmitter?  <P> A33: The device should be DP guage. <P> Q34: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.6:  What type of "discrete level devise" is expected to be provided? Would a level sensor with continuous output (4-20 mA) satisfy this requirement?  Is the intent to have (4) separate dp switches (one set at 0, 5, 95 and 100%)?  What output signal/indication is req'd from this device(s).   <P> A34: The intent was to have another device, in addition to a DP guage, that indicated a wetted/non-wetted state. A continuous level sensor could provide this functionality. <P> Q35: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.7:  What is the function of the 3 inch port?  Is this for venting/relief?  <P> A35: This is a port that can provide future access to the tank for installation of other devices that are to-be-determined. <P> Q36:  Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.9:	Should the measurements be made internal to the tank (actual fluid temperature) or can this be done on the outer surface of the inner vessel at the prescribed levels?  <P> A36: The measurements should be made internal to the tank. <P> Q37: RefSOW Paragraph 3.1.12:  The tank inner vessel material is not specified.  Is 9% nickel acceptable?  <P> A37: It is acceptable if it is LO2 compatible and reduces chilldown mass, etc. <P> Q38: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.4:  What is the heat leak of the accumulators?  <P> A38: The heat leak of the accumulators can be excluded from the calculation. <P> Q39: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.8:  How should the RTD wires be terminated?  <P> A39: The termination is TBD and will be agreed to by CDR. It is envisoned that a vacuum feed-through connector on the vacuum jacket will be provided by the vendor for RTDs in the vacuum annulus. The vendor can specify this connector. <P> Q40: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.9:  Drawing SMN24-100268 is referenced, however not included in the solicitation.  <P> A40: The drawing SMN24-100268 can be deleted. <P> Q41: Ref SOW Paragraphs 3.3.2 & 3.3.5  Is the "RCE stinger" valve the same as V8 in Figure 2?  <P> A41: Yes, the RCS stinger valve is V8 in figure 2. <P> Q42: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.1:  Is batch testing required for valve seal materials.  <P> A42: There are no specific requirements for batch testing. The vendor can recommend batch testing to insure quality of valve seal materials. <P> Q43: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.4:  Please provide more detail of the requirement for remote monitoring of VJ vacuum levels? <P> A43: It is anticipated that the vendor will provide the vacuum thermocouple guage and that NASA WSTF will connect to this guage on the end item. The vendor does not need to provide the remote monitoring function. <P> Q44:Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.6:  Please provide a copy of NSS 1740.15.  <P> A44: NASA standards are available at	 <A HREF="http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm"> http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm</A>	    <P> Q45: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.8:  Please provide a copy of MSFC-STD-250.

It applies only if passivation or anodization OW Paragraphs 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.4.10 & 3.4.11:	Commercially available helium valves and bayonets are rated for 275 PSIG and the specifications require 415 PSIA.  A47: It is anticipated that either 1) modification of the helium valve or bayonet design and pressure rating occur, or 2) exception be made to the requirement for liquid helium components be made, as long the heat leak requirement are satisfied. Q48: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.14 & 2.2:  Where does NASA-STD-5005a apply versus NASA-STD-5008?	A48: NASA-STD-5008 applies to the protective coating. For protective coatings, the NASA-STD-5005a calls out NASA-STD-5008, and 5005a recommends grey. NASA-STD-5005a is intended for reference only and only provides useful guidance for ground support equipment.	It is not applicable in its entirety. Q49: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.5.1:  Please provide a copy of SN-C-005.   A49: NASA standards are available at     http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm     .  Other equivalent contamination control standards may be used. Q50: Ref Drawing SLN24-100270: A leader that reads " 1.25" NPS Sch 5 pipe" does not point to anything in particular.  Please confirm that all of the feedsystem piping is specified as 1-1/2" NPS inner and 3" NPS jacket.	A50: All piping is specified as 1-1/2 NPS. Please ignore the 1.25 NPS. Q51: General Question:	What will be the test environment for the LO2/Ethanol VJ Tank and Feedsystem?  A51: The test environment will be a pressure from 14.7 psia down to 0 psia.	The temperature will be 40 F to 120 F.  There will be negligible acceleration or shock.  Q52: Ref 1.6 of SOW: Must a design be generated for the 1.5 inch NPS bayonet connection for the feedline fluid interfaces or does the mating assembly already exist? If the mating half exists or is already installed at the feedline interfaces, please provide specific contact information (vendor,model #, etc) in order to provide the compatible mate for each skid connection.   A52: The bayonets are to be provided by the vendor.  The vendor shall provide both mating parts.  Q53: Ref 1.7 of SOW: Confirm all necessary bleed/relief valves will be supplied by NASA/JSC?   A53: All relief and bleed valves will be procured and install separately at WSTF.  Q54: Ref 1.13 of SOW: Confirm whether or not a completely enclosed shipping container is necessary for each assembled skid package? If required, provide detailed and acceptable standards - i.e. materials of construction, outdoor storage, duration, etc?   A54:	The vendor is responsible for delivering the end items to WSTF near Las Cruces, New Mexico, in an a manner that protects the end item during transport.  Q55: Ref 2.2 Applicable Documents: Must the fabricator be an ISO9001 certified shop?  A55: Yes Q56: Ref 3.1.4 Liquid Oxygen and Ethanol Propellant Tanks: Please provide copy of Dwg SLN24-100266.  A56: This drawing was provided in Amendment 1. Q57: Ref 3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.1.9 and 3.2.8 Propellant Tanks and Piping Instruments/Sensors: Confirm requirements for providing and routing any and all necessary interconnecting wiring from the individual instrument to junction boxes? If required, please specify applicable electrical standards for wiring and boxes.  A57: The applicable documents section list any requirements for wiring.  The heat leak shall also include the effects of instrumentation (heat conduction along wire).   Q58: Ref 3.1.7 3-Inch port on top of propellant tank: Provide details of type/size required for this port?  A58: The details of the type and size are to be determined and agreed to by the critical design review. Q59: Ref 3.1.8 and 3.1.10: Confirm all necessary pressure, vent or relief devices will be supplied by NASA/JSC?  A59:  All vent valves, pressure relief, and bleed valves will be procured and install separately at WSTF.  Q60: Ref 3.2.4 and 3.2.5: Average heat leaks are indicated for both the entire system or the short line (aft) configuration. Are there any heat leak requirements specific to the globe valves or bayonet connection?  A60: The valve and bayonets are included in the average heat leak calculation.  The are no heat leak requirements specific to the valve or bayonet, only its contribution to the total system. Q61: Ref 3.2.9 Accumulator: Please provide copy of Drawing No. SMN24 -100268.	A61: The ref to SMN24-100268 can be deleted. Q62: Ref 3.2.11 VJ Piping: Is there a preferred design for external or internal expansion/contraction joints? Are there specific design criteria that the expansion joints must meet - i.e. minimum service/cycle life? materials of construction? etc? A62: Vendor shall provide design and materials of construction. Q63: Ref 3.3.1 thru 3.3.5 VJ Valves: Is there a valve specification or standard that must be followed? A63: There is not a standard. Q64: Are the automatic globe style valves for on/off service only or do they need flow controls? A64: The valves are only for on/off service. Q65: Must the automatic valves be globe style or is a gate or ball style valve acceptable? A65: The valves do not need to be globe valve. Q66: Is there a preferred type of pneumatic actuator - diaphragm? piston? electric? A66:  The valves only need to be capable of remote operation in a vacuum environment. Q67: What type of data package is required? A67:  The data deliverables describe the required data packages. Q68: In order to allow for proper clearances between the actual valve body and its jacket, each valve jacket may require a 4inch NPS outer vacuum jacket. Please confirm NASA/JSC acceptance of this larger jacket size in lieu of the 3-inch NPS generally specified in Note #1 on NASA/JSC Drawing No. SLN24-100270? A68:  A larger outer vacuum jacket is acceptable. Q69: Is there are pre-approved VJ valve manufacturer and if so, who?  A69: There is not a pre-approved manufacturer. Q70: Will each skidded unit be installed in an atmospheric chamber and operate under vacuum? Need to fully understand any and all operating conditions each skid assembly will be exposed to. If the skidded units are operating within an atmospheric chamber, one concern would be the VJ valve actuators. No natural ambient heating can occur which would help keep the valve bonnets from getting too cold and cause eventual leaking.  A70: The skid units will be operated in a vacuum environment.  Test cell radiation should provide enough heating to keep bonnets warm given that the valves should have very low heat leaks to meet overall system heat leak requirement. If this radiative heating is found not to be adequate, then NASA WSTF will provide any necessary heat to keep bonnets warm.  Q71: Ref SOW 3.3.3 & 3.3.5: RCE stinger isolation valve.  Do you have a specification for this valve?	A71: The RCE stinger isolation valves are valve V7 and V8 on the schematic. These are valves to be provided per the requirements in section 3.3 Isolation valve. Q72: Why is the heat leak requirement for the storage tank with piping 45 BTU/HR?  This is unreasonably low and we feel not attainable. Boil off with this heat leak would be only about 1/2 gallon of LOX per hour. Are the hold times so long that this low of heat leak is necessary?  A72: The hold times are long.  Please propose what is attainable, rationale, and design approach.  Q73: Is the inner vessel not having a manway part of the design or is it an oversight in the specifications. If the manway is not needed should hand acess holes be included to allow inspection of the inner for cleanliness?  A73: The manway is not required. The 3 inch port at the top will provide access for borescope, if needed. Q74: There is no RT requirement  are we correct assuming that the inner might be constructed with the appropriate joint efficiencies so that radiography of the inner is not required?  A74: Yes, that could be an option for the contruction, or radiography could used along with other joint efficiencies.  Q75: There appears to be no requirement on the design of the outer  should the outer be designed to a CGA critical collapse of 30 PSI?  A75: Vendor can recommend design requirements based on commercial standards. Q76: What is the purpose of the complex system of piping between V3 and V4?  A76: The tank and feedsystem will be used to test small reaction control engines.  These engines are coupled with the feedsystem dynamically.  The complex plumbing allows different line lengths (18, 50, 110) to be selected and therefore different feedsystem dynamic environments to be tested.  Q77: Do you want all mitered corners or std pipe fittings on the 90 turns on the inner of the VJ piping?  A77: The inner piping should use elbows of a constant radius.  Q78: Your spec calls for expansion joints on the VJ pipe - will these need to be lined so that the corrugations of the bellows  do not affect the flow of the liquid through the lines?    A79: The bellows do not need to be lined.	Q80: Spec 3.1.6  what type of sensor do you want as a discrete level sensor? Is this a capacitance probe, infrared, or ultrasound sensor?  A80: Vendor should recommend the type of sensor. Q81: Can we get a copy of DWG-SNL24-100266?  A81: Drawing was provided in Amendment #1. Q82. Spec 3.2.5: What is meant by the long transfer lines?   A82: The long transfer line is with 110 feet with V2,V3,V4 open and V1,V5 closed. Q82: Spec 3.2.8: The RTD thermocouples are to have what type of connection to the outside of the VJ piping?	 A82: Vendor can recommend and specify vacuum feedthrough connector.  Q83: Spec 3.3.2: What is a RCE stinger? Is this the Flex hose and bayonet connection?  A83: The RCE (Reaction Control Engine) stinger will be connected using the bayonet connection. The RCE stinger contains the reaction control engines to which the liquids are being supplied.  Q83: Spec 3.4.8: Are the tanks and piping to be passivated? If so Where can we find MSFC-STD-250?  A83: Yes, the tank and piping should be passivated. NASA standards are available at    http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm    . Q84: Spec 3.4.13: As we read this all joints are to be leak tested at room temperature and at LOX temp. Is it acceptable to cool down the tank with Liquid nitrogen, pressurize with Helium, allow the Helium to cool down then vent the liquid nitrogen and perform the leak test? Is this test to be performed on all of the lines and valves?  A84: This test method would be acceptable. It is also possible with justification that a Ghe test at ambient temperature may be sufficient to verify this requirement.     The due date for receipt of offers is extended to February 14, 2003. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 1/7/03.

Other equivalent contamination control standards may be used. <P> Q50: Ref Drawing SLN24-100270: A leader that reads " 1.25" NPS Sch 5 pipe" does not point to anything in particular.  Please confirm that all of the feedsystem piping is specified as 1-1/2" NPS inner and 3" NPS jacket.  <P> A50: All piping is specified as 1-1/2 NPS. Please ignore the 1.25 NPS. <P> Q51: General Question:	What will be the test environment for the LO2/Ethanol VJ Tank and Feedsystem?  <P> A51: The test environment will be a pressure from 14.7 psia down to 0 psia.  The temperature will be 40 F to 120 F.  There will be negligible acceleration or shock.  <P> Q52: Ref 1.6 of SOW: Must a design be generated for the 1.5 inch NPS bayonet connection for the feedline fluid interfaces or does the mating assembly already exist? If the mating half exists or is already installed at the feedline interfaces, please provide specific contact information (vendor,model #, etc) in order to provide the compatible mate for each skid connection.   <P> A52: The bayonets are to be provided by the vendor.  The vendor shall provide both mating parts.  <P> Q53: Ref 1.7 of SOW: Confirm all necessary bleed/relief valves will be supplied by NASA/JSC?   <P> A53: All relief and bleed valves will be procured and install separately at WSTF.  <P> Q54: Ref 1.13 of SOW: Confirm whether or not a completely enclosed shipping container is necessary for each assembled skid package? If required, provide detailed and acceptable standards - i.e. materials of construction, outdoor storage, duration, etc?   <P> A54:  The vendor is responsible for delivering the end items to WSTF near Las Cruces, New Mexico, in an a manner that protects the end item during transport.  <P> Q55: Ref 2.2 Applicable Documents: Must the fabricator be an ISO9001 certified shop?  <P> A55: Yes <P> Q56: Ref 3.1.4 Liquid Oxygen and Ethanol Propellant Tanks: Please provide copy of Dwg SLN24-100266.  <P> A56: This drawing was provided in Amendment 1. <P> Q57: Ref 3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.1.9 and 3.2.8 Propellant Tanks and Piping Instruments/Sensors: Confirm requirements for providing and routing any and all necessary interconnecting wiring from the individual instrument to junction boxes? If required, please specify applicable electrical standards for wiring and boxes.  <P> A57: The applicable documents section list any requirements for wiring.  The heat leak shall also include the effects of instrumentation (heat conduction along wire).   <P> Q58: Ref 3.1.7 3-Inch port on top of propellant tank: Provide details of type/size required for this port?  <P> A58: The details of the type and size are to be determined and agreed to by the critical design review. <P> Q59: Ref 3.1.8 and 3.1.10: Confirm all necessary pressure, vent or relief devices will be supplied by NASA/JSC?  <P> A59:  All vent valves, pressure relief, and bleed valves will be procured and install separately at WSTF.  <P> Q60: Ref 3.2.4 and 3.2.5: Average heat leaks are indicated for both the entire system or the short line (aft) configuration. Are there any heat leak requirements specific to the globe valves or bayonet connection?  <P> A60: The valve and bayonets are included in the average heat leak calculation.  The are no heat leak requirements specific to the valve or bayonet, only its contribution to the total system. <P> Q61: Ref 3.2.9 Accumulator: Please provide copy of Drawing No. SMN24 -100268.  <P> A61: The ref to SMN24-100268 can be deleted. <P> Q62: Ref 3.2.11 VJ Piping: Is there a preferred design for external or internal expansion/contraction joints? Are there specific design criteria that the expansion joints must meet - i.e. minimum service/cycle life? materials of construction? etc? <P> A62: Vendor shall provide design and materials of construction. <P> Q63: Ref 3.3.1 thru 3.3.5 VJ Valves: Is there a valve specification or standard that must be followed? <P> A63: There is not a standard. <P> Q64: Are the automatic globe style valves for on/off service only or do they need flow controls? <P> A64: The valves are only for on/off service. <P> Q65: Must the automatic valves be globe style or is a gate or ball style valve acceptable? <P> A65: The valves do not need to be globe valve. <P> Q66: Is there a preferred type of pneumatic actuator - diaphragm? piston? electric? <P> A66:  The valves only need to be capable of remote operation in a vacuum environment. <P> Q67: What type of data package is required? <P> A67:  The data deliverables describe the required data packages. <P> Q68: In order to allow for proper clearances between the actual valve body and its jacket, each valve jacket may require a 4inch NPS outer vacuum jacket. Please confirm NASA/JSC acceptance of this larger jacket size in lieu of the 3-inch NPS generally specified in Note #1 on NASA/JSC Drawing No. SLN24-100270? <P> A68:  A larger outer vacuum jacket is acceptable. <P> Q69: Is there are pre-approved VJ valve manufacturer and if so, who?  <P> A69: There is not a pre-approved manufacturer. <P> Q70: Will each skidded unit be installed in an atmospheric chamber and operate under vacuum? Need to fully understand any and all operating conditions each skid assembly will be exposed to. If the skidded units are operating within an atmospheric chamber, one concern would be the VJ valve actuators. No natural ambient heating can occur which would help keep the valve bonnets from getting too cold and cause eventual leaking.  <P> A70: The skid units will be operated in a vacuum environment.  Test cell radiation should provide enough heating to keep bonnets warm given that the valves should have very low heat leaks to meet overall system heat leak requirement. If this radiative heating is found not to be adequate, then NASA WSTF will provide any necessary heat to keep bonnets warm.  <P> Q71: Ref SOW 3.3.3 & 3.3.5: RCE stinger isolation valve.  Do you have a specification for this valve?   <P> A71: The RCE stinger isolation valves are valve V7 and V8 on the schematic. These are valves to be provided per the requirements in section 3.3 Isolation valve. <P> Q72: Why is the heat leak requirement for the storage tank with piping 45 BTU/HR?  This is unreasonably low and we feel not attainable. Boil off with this heat leak would be only about 1/2 gallon of LOX per hour. Are the hold times so long that this low of heat leak is necessary?  <P> A72: The hold times are long.  Please propose what is attainable, rationale, and design approach.  <P> Q73: Is the inner vessel not having a manway part of the design or is it an oversight in the specifications. If the manway is not needed should hand acess holes be included to allow inspection of the inner for cleanliness?  <P> A73: The manway is not required. The 3 inch port at the top will provide access for borescope, if needed. <P> Q74: There is no RT requirement  are we correct assuming that the inner might be constructed with the appropriate joint efficiencies so that radiography of the inner is not required?  <P> A74: Yes, that could be an option for the contruction, or radiography could used along with other joint efficiencies.  <P> Q75: There appears to be no requirement on the design of the outer  should the outer be designed to a CGA critical collapse of 30 PSI?  <P> A75: Vendor can recommend design requirements based on commercial standards. <P> Q76: What is the purpose of the complex system of piping between V3 and V4? <P> A76: The tank and feedsystem will be used to test small reaction control engines.  These engines are coupled with the feedsystem dynamically.  The complex plumbing allows different line lengths (18, 50, 110) to be selected and therefore different feedsystem dynamic environments to be tested.  <P> Q77: Do you want all mitered corners or std pipe fittings on the 90 turns on the inner of the VJ piping?  <P> A77: The inner piping should use elbows of a constant radius.  <P> Q78: Your spec calls for expansion joints on the VJ pipe - will these need to be lined so that the corrugations of the bellows  do not affect the flow of the liquid through the lines?    <P> A79: The bellows do not need to be lined.  <P> Q80: Spec 3.1.6  what type of sensor do you want as a discrete level sensor? Is this a capacitance probe, infrared, or ultrasound sensor?  <P> A80: Vendor should recommend the type of sensor. <P> Q81: Can we get a copy of DWG-SNL24-100266?  <P> A81: Drawing was provided in Amendment #1. <P> Q82. Spec 3.2.5: What is meant by the long transfer lines?   <P> A82: The long transfer line is with 110 feet with V2,V3,V4 open and V1,V5 closed. <P> Q82: Spec 3.2.8: The RTD thermocouples are to have what type of connection to the outside of the VJ piping?   <P> A82: Vendor can recommend and specify vacuum feedthrough connector.  <P> Q83: Spec 3.3.2: What is a RCE stinger? Is this the Flex hose and bayonet connection?  <P> A83: The RCE (Reaction Control Engine) stinger will be connected using the bayonet connection. The RCE stinger contains the reaction control engines to which the liquids are being supplied.  <P> Q83: Spec 3.4.8: Are the tanks and piping to be passivated? If so Where can we find MSFC-STD-250?  <P> A83: Yes, the tank and piping should be passivated. NASA standards are available at	<A HREF="http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm"> http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm</A>	   . <P> Q84: Spec 3.4.13: As we read this all joints are to be leak tested at room temperature and at LOX temp. Is it acceptable to cool down the tank with Liquid nitrogen, pressurize with Helium, allow the Helium to cool down then vent the liquid nitrogen and perform the leak test? Is this test to be performed on all of the lines and valves?	  <P> A84: This test method would be acceptable. It is also possible with justification that a Ghe test at ambient temperature may be sufficient to verify this requirement.  The due date for receipt of offers is extended to February 14, 2003. <P> Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 1/7/03.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR LO2/ETHANOL VACUUM JACKETED TANK AND FEEDSYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. <P> The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received on the subject synopsis/RFQ.  See amendment 1 for questions/answers to 1-23. <P> Q24. Ref SOW Paragraph 1.0: What spare hardware is required other than tank long lead piece parts?  <P> A24: No other spare hardware is required. Other spare hardware will be procured as needed. <P> Q25: Ref SOW Paragraph 1.4: Can we get a better definition of what long lead pieces are desired?  <P> A25: This is at vendor discretion. Long lead shall be defined as any part that is not normally kept in stock. <P> Q26: Reference SOW Paragraph 1.6 and Figure 2: Please define the purpose of the connections requiring AN-KC fittings.  Are these to be drain and or purge ports?  Shall these fittings be capped? Relief protected? Insulated in any manner?  <P> A26: The AN-KC fitting are 1) a liquid fill and drain valve, and 2) a feedsystem outlet.  WSTF will provide relief device and any insulation. The vendor need only provide caps for shipping. <P> Q27: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.7 and 3.2.8: Please define the interface preference for instrumentation such as pressure transducers and thermocouples.	Will NASA wire directly to the pressure transducers for remote indication or shall the Skid/Tank/Piping assembly include a junction box to which these devices shall wired for interface.  This same question applies to valves.  Does NASA intend to connect the actuator signal wires to each of the individual valves or do NASA desire that all of the valves be wired to a junction box for interface with remote controls.  <P> A27: There is no preference in that NASA WSTF can adapt to the vendor standard practice for the instruments. NASA WSTF will install and wire the pressure transducers and actuator signal wires. The port for the pressure transducers is TBD but could be a  AN fitting. The vendor shall provide a description of the thermocouple connector on the vacuum jacketing. <P> Q28: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.7, 3.2.6 & 3.2.7:  These paragraphs require ports for pressure relief and high point bleeds however the specifications do not mention any requirements for relief valve or bleed valves.  Are there any requirements for relief valves and bleed valves?   <P> A28: The relief valves and bleed valves will be procured and installed separately at WSTF. <P> Q29: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.9, 3.4.14 & DWGSDN24-100274: Is carbon steel A36 acceptable for the secondary support structure, as indicated on the drawing?   <P> A29: Carbon steel A36 is acceptable. NASA-STD-5008 should be followed for protective coating. <P> Q30: Ref SOW Paragraph 1.16:  Please describe the "test article" which requires pressure drop testing.  Does this imply measuring the pressure drop across the piping, valves and accumulator?  What is the required flow rate for the pressure drop test?  What is the acceptability criteria?  What is the Cv for the accumulator?	What are the points of measurement?  <P> A30: The pressure drop test is to ensure that nothing is blocking the lines after final assembly. The test can be performed using a method and acceptability criteria recommended by the vendor.  The GFE accumulator housing provided by NASA will include a bypass manifold that allows flow to go through lines with actually flowing into the accumulator, so a CV is not required for the accumulator. <P> Q31: Ref SOW Paragraph 2.2:  Please provide copies of NASA & MSFC Specifications, including MSFC-SPEC-164, MSFC-SPEC-222, NASA-STD-5008, MSFC-STD-486 & NASA-STD-5005a.	 <P> A31: NASA standards are available at	 <A HREF="http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm"> http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm</A>	    . <P> Q32: Ref SOW Paragraphs 3.1.4, 3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.1.8,3.1.10 & 3.1.11:  DWG SLN24-100266 is referenced in each of these paragraphs but is not included in the solicitation package. We request better definition of the non-jacketed tank piping.  Is the tank fill circuit to be standard top and bottom fill or top or bottom fill only?  Is a standard full trycock required to indicate net full or will this be done with instrumentation only? Standard 1" vent line with 1" dual relief system or sizing criteria for us that we can calculate.  <P> A32: The fill was intended to be bottom fill, but vendor can recommend design. A standard full trycock can be proposed in addition to instrumentation. Information for vent and relief system sizing will be provided at contract start. <P> Q33: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.5:  Is the dp sensor to be an indication device only (dp guage) or an electronic transmitter?  <P> A33: The device should be DP guage. <P> Q34: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.6:  What type of "discrete level devise" is expected to be provided? Would a level sensor with continuous output (4-20 mA) satisfy this requirement?  Is the intent to have (4) separate dp switches (one set at 0, 5, 95 and 100%)?  What output signal/indication is req'd from this device(s).   <P> A34: The intent was to have another device, in addition to a DP guage, that indicated a wetted/non-wetted state. A continuous level sensor could provide this functionality. <P> Q35: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.7:  What is the function of the 3 inch port?  Is this for venting/relief?  <P> A35: This is a port that can provide future access to the tank for installation of other devices that are to-be-determined. <P> Q36:  Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.9:	Should the measurements be made internal to the tank (actual fluid temperature) or can this be done on the outer surface of the inner vessel at the prescribed levels?  <P> A36: The measurements should be made internal to the tank. <P> Q37: RefSOW Paragraph 3.1.12:  The tank inner vessel material is not specified.  Is 9% nickel acceptable?  <P> A37: It is acceptable if it is LO2 compatible and reduces chilldown mass, etc. <P> Q38: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.4:  What is the heat leak of the accumulators?  <P> A38: The heat leak of the accumulators can be excluded from the calculation. <P> Q39: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.8:  How should the RTD wires be terminated?  <P> A39: The termination is TBD and will be agreed to by CDR. It is envisoned that a vacuum feed-through connector on the vacuum jacket will be provided by the vendor for RTDs in the vacuum annulus. The vendor can specify this connector. <P> Q40: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.9:  Drawing SMN24-100268 is referenced, however not included in the solicitation.  <P> A40: The drawing SMN24-100268 can be deleted. <P> Q41: Ref SOW Paragraphs 3.3.2 & 3.3.5  Is the "RCE stinger" valve the same as V8 in Figure 2?  <P> A41: Yes, the RCS stinger valve is V8 in figure 2. <P> Q42: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.1:  Is batch testing required for valve seal materials.  <P> A42: There are no specific requirements for batch testing.

Are there specific design criteria that the expansion joints must meet - i.e. minimum service/cycle life? materials of construction? etc? <P> A62: Vendor shall provide design and materials of construction. <P> Q63: Ref 3.3.1 thru 3.3.5 VJ Valves: Is there a valve specification or standard that must be followed? <P> A63: There is not a standard. <P> Q64: Are the automatic globe style valves for on/off service only or do they need flow controls? <P> A64: The valves are only for on/off service. <P> Q65: Must the automatic valves be globe style or is a gate or ball style valve acceptable? <P> A65: The valves do not need to be globe valve. <P> Q66: Is there a preferred type of pneumatic actuator - diaphragm? piston? electric? <P> A66:  The valves only need to be capable of remote operation in a vacuum environment. <P> Q67: What type of data package is required? <P> A67:  The data deliverables describe the required data packages. <P> Q68: In order to allow for proper clearances between the actual valve body and its jacket, each valve jacket may require a 4inch NPS outer vacuum jacket. Please confirm NASA/JSC acceptance of this larger jacket size in lieu of the 3-inch NPS generally specified in Note #1 on NASA/JSC Drawing No. SLN24-100270? <P> A68:  A larger outer vacuum jacket is acceptable. <P> Q69: Is there are pre-approved VJ valve manufacturer and if so, who?  <P> A69: There is not a pre-approved manufacturer. <P> Q70: Will each skidded unit be installed in an atmospheric chamber and operate under vacuum? Need to fully understand any and all operating conditions each skid assembly will be exposed to. If the skidded units are operating within an atmospheric chamber, one concern would be the VJ valve actuators. No natural ambient heating can occur which would help keep the valve bonnets from getting too cold and cause eventual leaking.  <P> A70: The skid units will be operated in a vacuum environment.  Test cell radiation should provide enough heating to keep bonnets warm given that the valves should have very low heat leaks to meet overall system heat leak requirement. If this radiative heating is found not to be adequate, then NASA WSTF will provide any necessary heat to keep bonnets warm.  <P> Q71: Ref SOW 3.3.3 & 3.3.5: RCE stinger isolation valve.  Do you have a specification for this valve?   <P> A71: The RCE stinger isolation valves are valve V7 and V8 on the schematic. These are valves to be provided per the requirements in section 3.3 Isolation valve. <P> Q72: Why is the heat leak requirement for the storage tank with piping 45 BTU/HR?  This is unreasonably low and we feel not attainable. Boil off with this heat leak would be only about 1/2 gallon of LOX per hour. Are the hold times so long that this low of heat leak is necessary?  <P> A72: The hold times are long.  Please propose what is attainable, rationale, and design approach.  <P> Q73: Is the inner vessel not having a manway part of the design or is it an oversight in the specifications. If the manway is not needed should hand acess holes be included to allow inspection of the inner for cleanliness?  <P> A73: The manway is not required. The 3 inch port at the top will provide access for borescope, if needed. <P> Q74: There is no RT requirement  are we correct assuming that the inner might be constructed with the appropriate joint efficiencies so that radiography of the inner is not required?  <P> A74: Yes, that could be an option for the contruction, or radiography could used along with other joint efficiencies.  <P> Q75: There appears to be no requirement on the design of the outer  should the outer be designed to a CGA critical collapse of 30 PSI?  <P> A75: Vendor can recommend design requirements based on commercial standards. <P> Q76: What is the purpose of the complex system of piping between V3 and V4? <P> A76: The tank and feedsystem will be used to test small reaction control engines.  These engines are coupled with the feedsystem dynamically.  The complex plumbing allows different line lengths (18, 50, 110) to be selected and therefore different feedsystem dynamic environments to be tested.  <P> Q77: Do you want all mitered corners or std pipe fittings on the 90 turns on the inner of the VJ piping?  <P> A77: The inner piping should use elbows of a constant radius.  <P> Q78: Your spec calls for expansion joints on the VJ pipe - will these need to be lined so that the corrugations of the bellows  do not affect the flow of the liquid through the lines?    <P> A79: The bellows do not need to be lined.  <P> Q80: Spec 3.1.6  what type of sensor do you want as a discrete level sensor? Is this a capacitance probe, infrared, or ultrasound sensor?  <P> A80: Vendor should recommend the type of sensor. <P> Q81: Can we get a copy of DWG-SNL24-100266?  <P> A81: Drawing was provided in Amendment #1. <P> Q82. Spec 3.2.5: What is meant by the long transfer lines?   <P> A82: The long transfer line is with 110 feet with V2,V3,V4 open and V1,V5 closed. <P> Q82: Spec 3.2.8: The RTD thermocouples are to have what type of connection to the outside of the VJ piping?   <P> A82: Vendor can recommend and specify vacuum feedthrough connector.  <P> Q83: Spec 3.3.2: What is a RCE stinger? Is this the Flex hose and bayonet connection?  <P> A83: The RCE (Reaction Control Engine) stinger will be connected using the bayonet connection. The RCE stinger contains the reaction control engines to which the liquids are being supplied.  <P> Q83: Spec 3.4.8: Are the tanks and piping to be passivated? If so Where can we find MSFC-STD-250?  <P> A83: Yes, the tank and piping should be passivated. NASA standards are available at	<A HREF="http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm"> http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm</A>	   . <P> Q84: Spec 3.4.13: As we read this all joints are to be leak tested at room temperature and at LOX temp. Is it acceptable to cool down the tank with Liquid nitrogen, pressurize with Helium, allow the Helium to cool down then vent the liquid nitrogen and perform the leak test? Is this test to be performed on all of the lines and valves?	  <P> A84: This test method would be acceptable. It is also possible with justification that a Ghe test at ambient temperature may be sufficient to verify this requirement.  The due date for receipt of offers is extended to February 14, 2003. <P> Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 1/7/03.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR LO2/ETHANOL VACUUM JACKETED TANK AND FEEDSYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. <P> The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received on the subject synopsis/RFQ.  See amendment 1 for questions/answers to 1-23. <P> Q24. Ref SOW Paragraph 1.0: What spare hardware is required other than tank long lead piece parts?  <P> A24: No other spare hardware is required. Other spare hardware will be procured as needed. <P> Q25: Ref SOW Paragraph 1.4: Can we get a better definition of what long lead pieces are desired?  <P> A25: This is at vendor discretion. Long lead shall be defined as any part that is not normally kept in stock. <P> Q26: Reference SOW Paragraph 1.6 and Figure 2: Please define the purpose of the connections requiring AN-KC fittings.  Are these to be drain and or purge ports?  Shall these fittings be capped? Relief protected? Insulated in any manner?  <P> A26: The AN-KC fitting are 1) a liquid fill and drain valve, and 2) a feedsystem outlet.  WSTF will provide relief device and any insulation. The vendor need only provide caps for shipping. <P> Q27: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.7 and 3.2.8: Please define the interface preference for instrumentation such as pressure transducers and thermocouples.	Will NASA wire directly to the pressure transducers for remote indication or shall the Skid/Tank/Piping assembly include a junction box to which these devices shall wired for interface.  This same question applies to valves.  Does NASA intend to connect the actuator signal wires to each of the individual valves or do NASA desire that all of the valves be wired to a junction box for interface with remote controls.  <P> A27: There is no preference in that NASA WSTF can adapt to the vendor standard practice for the instruments. NASA WSTF will install and wire the pressure transducers and actuator signal wires. The port for the pressure transducers is TBD but could be a  AN fitting. The vendor shall provide a description of the thermocouple connector on the vacuum jacketing. <P> Q28: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.7, 3.2.6 & 3.2.7:  These paragraphs require ports for pressure relief and high point bleeds however the specifications do not mention any requirements for relief valve or bleed valves.  Are there any requirements for relief valves and bleed valves?   <P> A28: The relief valves and bleed valves will be procured and installed separately at WSTF. <P> Q29: Ref SOW Paragraphs 1.9, 3.4.14 & DWGSDN24-100274: Is carbon steel A36 acceptable for the secondary support structure, as indicated on the drawing?   <P> A29: Carbon steel A36 is acceptable. NASA-STD-5008 should be followed for protective coating. <P> Q30: Ref SOW Paragraph 1.16:  Please describe the "test article" which requires pressure drop testing.  Does this imply measuring the pressure drop across the piping, valves and accumulator?  What is the required flow rate for the pressure drop test?  What is the acceptability criteria?  What is the Cv for the accumulator?	What are the points of measurement?  <P> A30: The pressure drop test is to ensure that nothing is blocking the lines after final assembly. The test can be performed using a method and acceptability criteria recommended by the vendor.  The GFE accumulator housing provided by NASA will include a bypass manifold that allows flow to go through lines with actually flowing into the accumulator, so a CV is not required for the accumulator. <P> Q31: Ref SOW Paragraph 2.2:  Please provide copies of NASA & MSFC Specifications, including MSFC-SPEC-164, MSFC-SPEC-222, NASA-STD-5008, MSFC-STD-486 & NASA-STD-5005a.	 <P> A31: NASA standards are available at	 <A HREF="http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm"> http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm</A>	    . <P> Q32: Ref SOW Paragraphs 3.1.4, 3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.1.8,request better definition of the non-jacketed tank piping.	Is the tank fill circuit to be standard top and bottom fill or top or bottom fill only?  Is a standard full trycock required to indicate net full or will this be done with instrumentation only? Standard 1" vent line with 1" dual relief system or sizing criteria for us that we can calculate.  A32: The fill was intended to be bottom fill, but vendor can recommend design. A standard full trycock can be proposed in addition to instrumentation. Information for vent and relief system sizing will be provided at contract start. Q33: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.5:  Is the dp sensor to be an indication device only (dp guage) or an electronic transmitter?  A33: The device should be DP guage. Q34: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.6:  What type of "discrete level devise" is expected to be provided? Would a level sensor with continuous output (4-20 mA) satisfy this requirement?  Is the intent to have (4) separate dp switches (one set at 0, 5, 95 and 100%)?  What output signal/indication is req'd from this device(s).   A34: The intent was to have another device, in addition to a DP guage, that indicated a wetted/non-wetted state. A continuous level sensor could provide this functionality. Q35: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.7:  What is the function of the 3 inch port?  Is this for venting/relief?  A35: This is a port that can provide future access to the tank for installation of other devices that are to-be-determined. Q36:  Ref SOW Paragraph 3.1.9:  Should the measurements be made internal to the tank (actual fluid temperature) or can this be done on the outer surface of the inner vessel at the prescribed levels?  A36: The measurements should be made internal to the tank. Q37: RefSOW Paragraph 3.1.12:  The tank inner vessel material is not specified.  Is 9% nickel acceptable?  A37: It is acceptable if it is LO2 compatible and reduces chilldown mass, etc. Q38: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.4:  What is the heat leak of the accumulators?	A38: The heat leak of the accumulators can be excluded from the calculation. Q39: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.8:  How should the RTD wires be terminated?  A39: The termination is TBD and will be agreed to by CDR. It is envisoned that a vacuum feed-through connector on the vacuum jacket will be provided by the vendor for RTDs in the vacuum annulus. The vendor can specify this connector. Q40: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.2.9:	Drawing SMN24-100268 is referenced, however not included in the solicitation.  A40: The drawing SMN24-100268 can be deleted. Q41: Ref SOW Paragraphs 3.3.2 & 3.3.5  Is the "RCE stinger" valve the same as V8 in Figure 2?  A41: Yes, the RCS stinger valve is V8 in figure 2. Q42: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.1:  Is batch testing required for valve seal materials.  A42: There are no specific requirements for batch testing. The vendor can recommend batch testing to insure quality of valve seal materials. Q43: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.4:  Please provide more detail of the requirement for remote monitoring of VJ vacuum levels? A43: It is anticipated that the vendor will provide the vacuum thermocouple guage and that NASA WSTF will connect to this guage on the end item. The vendor does not need to provide the remote monitoring function. Q44:Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.6:  Please provide a copy of NSS 1740.15.	A44: NASA standards are available at	 http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm     Q45: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.8:	Please provide a copy of MSFC-STD-250.	To which materials does the anodization or passivation apply.  A45: NASA standards are available at     http://standards.msfc.nasa.gov/default.htm     .  It applies only if passivation or anodization is utilized. Q46: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.9:  Does material traceability apply only to pressure boundary materials?   A46: In SOW 3.4.9 the vendor shall identify, mark, and track (serial number) the major components. Any requirements for material traceability are per the ASME code for the pressure vessel and piping, or vendor ISO9001 practices. Q47: Ref Sis utilized. <P> Q46: Ref SOW Paragraph 3.4.9:  Does material traceability apply only to pressure boundary materials?   <P> A46: In SOW 3.4.9 the vendor shall identify, mark, and track (serial number) the major components.

Due date is extended to February 13, 2003 at 3:00 pm Honduran time.  Following are the respond to questions raised under the RFP No. 522-03-040:

QUESTION AND ANSWERS:

1-Is the original response date of January 31st being pushed back? 
Response: Yes, Due Date has been extended to February 13, 2003 at 3:00 pm.

2- What dimensions and/or type of fiber glass/heavy duty plastic chairs are you seeking?
Response: Chairs needed must be very stong.  Example: To be able to support 300 pounds withouth breaking.

3- What is the desired thickness of the conductive litter pad?
Response: Same response of question No. 2.

4- Since this is a USAID funded project, does the geographical code 000 apply to this RFP? Should the product be manufactured in the US only?
Response: Geographic Code is: ?000? USA only.

5-The specification for item # 8 - Balance Beam Pediatric Scale is asking for "Capacity 361 Lb", which is probably a misspelling. Could you, please, clarify what capacity is acceptable?
Response:  Pediatric Scale: The correct capacity is 36 Lb. instead of 3611lb.

6- Similar products have been specified in the Solicitation IFB 97-050 in 1997. Could you, please, provide us with the model of Soap Dispenser which was purchased at that time? Also, could you, please, indicate the incumbent on the previous procurement?
Response: Soap Dispenser specifications are clear.

7- Finally, the solicitation does not specify how many copies of the proposal are required. Could you, please, let us know if one copy and one original will suffice?
Response: Three (3) hard copies of your proposal can be acceptable.
 
8-The RFP is asking for the prices CIP American Embassy in Honduras. Do you intend to award only one contract to one supplier or the items will be split among many suppliers? 
Response: USAID/Honduras intents to award, multiple awards or only one resulting from this solicitation.

<CONTACT>Sonya Rappoport, Contract Specialist (973)724-2775
<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-  5000 seeks to acquire the services of a qualified vendor to provide system  design, fabrication, installation, start-up, testing and operation of plasma  arc thermal treatment systems for the demilitarization of military ordnance.  The services are required in order to complete two on-going projects as well as  fully execute one new project.  The two on-going projects are the Plasma  Ordnance Demilitarization System (PODS) being implemented at Hawthorne Army  Depot, Hawthorne, NV and the Mobile Plasma Treatment System (MPTS) being  implemented at Talon Manufacturing Company, Herndon, WV.  Both of these  projects employ plasma arc furnace systems designed and fabricated by MSE- Technology Applications, Inc. of Butte, MT.  The new project will be a combined  plasma arc/cryofracture system and will likely be implemented at Sierra Army  Depot, Herlong, CA.  This system has not yet been designed or fabricated. The PODS is a full scale plasma arc treatment system that includes a 400 cubic  foot primary processing chamber, state-of-the-art pollution abatement system,  feed system, water treatment system, PC based control system, and all ancillary  support systems (deionize water, chiller, compressed air, etc.).  The furnace  operates in an oxygen-enriched environment and contains a 1MW simultaneous  transferred/non-transferred and 500kW non-transferred plasma arc torch.  The  system has a 500 lb/hr nominal throughput of pyrotechnic ordnance, which  consists of high thermal output and high off gas output burning devices  contained in metal, plastic, and cardboard casings.  The system has been  designed, fabricated, factory acceptance tested, installed and partially tested  at HWAD.  Services would be required starting in FY04 to complete start-up  testing, train HWAD personnel, conduct environmental compliance tests, obtain  final environmental permits, update engineering and maintenance documentation,  perform process demonstration/validation/optimization tests, perform system  maintenance as may be required, and transition the system to full-scale  production operations. The MPTS is a transportable plasma arc treatment system  that includes a primary processing chamber (furnace), state-of-the-art  pollution abatement system, feed system, PC based control system, an air  compressor, a 4160V generator, a cooling system and a dionized water system.  The furnace operates in an oxygen-starved (reducing) environment and contains a  500kW plasma arc torch.  The system has a 300 lb/hr nominal throughput for  fuzes and fuze components, which is the feed material that will be processed at  the Talon site.  The system has been designed, fabricated, assembled and  factory acceptance tested.  The system is skid mounted and can be transported  on 9 flat bed trailers for set-up and operation.  Services are required  starting in FY04, at which time the system will have already been installed,  started-up, and be ready for operation at Talon.  Services are required to  operate the MPTS for a period of not less than one year in order to complete  the fuze demilitarization campaign, evaluate process performance, perform  system maintenance, decommission and disassemble the system, load it onto flat  bed trailers and transport it to a location to be designated. The combined  plasma arc/cryofracture project is intended to provide complete emilitarization  of high explosive-containing submunitions downloaded from Cluster Bomb Units  (CBUs) and 105MM/155MM artillery rounds.  The process involves downloading of  the submunitions, handling of the submunitions, cryofracture of the  submunitions, transfer of the cryofractured debris into a plasma system, and  processing of the debris into a benign slag (or recovered metal) and clean off  gas compliant with the latest environmental emission requirements.  For the  plasma arc process portion of the combined system, the prospective contractor  is required to design, fabricate, start-up, demonstrate and transition the  system to full scale demil operations, as well as obtain all environmental  permits and provide training and maintenance documentation. Integration of the  system with the cryofracture portion of the process (Government furnished) is  also required.  The contractor shall use the existing PODS and MPTS systems as  a starting point for the design, to maximize lessons learned and minimize  technical risk. For each of the above projects, the prospective contractor  should have the following: a. Experience and familiarity in the design,  fabrication, installation, testing, and prove-out of plasma systems tailored  for the processing of military munitions, of similar design configuration,  size, complexity and throughput as the above. b. Test data supporting the  ability to operate plasma furnaces in both oxidizing and reducing environments  for a continuous 120 hours without torch electrode replacement. Firms with  experience in the areas cited above should provide a summary of their companys  capabilities, including a description of facilities, equipment, personnel and  past experience to meet this requirement.  This shall include documentation  describing actual systems designed, fabricated, installed, started-up, tested,  and operated, as well as a description of operating experience including wastes  processed, processing rates achieved, operating hours logged, torch electrode  life data, and maintenance issues/malfunctions encountered.  This Market Survey  is for planning purposes and should not be construed as a request for proposal  or as a commitment on the part of the Government to issue a solicitation.  Information and samples shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the  Government. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the  results of this survey.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), is seeking qualified sources capable of performing the research, development, verification, and transfer of advanced airborne remote sensing and other space and earth related technologies in support of various program areas including Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), Ocean Surface Metric Measurements, and Global Carbon Cycle Studies. It is anticipated that performance will be for five years, commencing on December 1, 2003. The ATM, and its preceding flying laser laboratory version, the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL), have been utilized as research tools to demonstrate the feasibility of performing various tasks in the areas of airborne lidar applications for remote sensing of terrain information to government agencies needing the technology.  The ATM project will require the following types of research efforts, including mission planning, instrument development, calibration, and operation as well as analytical support in these areas to provide ice and terrain mapping data in support of the program:  measurements of glacier and ice sheet topography in remote areas of the arctic including Greenland, the Canadian archipelago, Svalbard, and Alaska as well as tasks that may evolve to survey portions of Antarctica; airborne coastal mapping including surveying of large tracks of beaches extending around most of CONUS and additional coastal surveys in other areas of the world that may become of interest as a result of changing focus in earth science programs; measurement of sea ice topography and freeboard including the development of methods to associate the topographic and freeboard measurements with associated sea ice thickness and subsurface morphology; mapping of other areas of geologic interest in support of earth science investigations such as volcanic features of Iceland or other sites including regions of subsidence that may result from programmatic collaboration with investigators from various institutions; high density lidar measurement of oceanic wave fields including methods to mitigate problems associated with mixed returns from the ocean surface and volume; and development of techniques for validation and calibration of Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) satellite-derived glacier, ice sheet, and sea ice topography using selected high density surveys of targets acquired with the ATM both historically and during the life of the altimeter satellite.  The measurement of the glaciers, ice sheets, and coastal areas will all involve the capability to repeat flight lines over the targets to establish net changes in surface morphology and height related to regional climate change (ice) and coastal processes (coastline). These activities involve the high accuracy application of DoD's Satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to derive precise aircraft trajectories essential for determination of individual laser spot elevations.  The ice surface measurements in particular involve large separation distances between the location of the staging airport and the survey sites, sometimes in excess of 1,000 KM.	It is generally not practical to place fixed GPS ground stations within or near the location of the remote sections of ice being surveyed.  In addition, accurate knowledge of aircraft attitude is essential to determination of individual laser spot elevations.  The ATM program has generally relied on the use of aircraft inertial navigation systems (INS) of various types to satisfy this requirement.  Techniques to determine biases associated between the INS and ATM mounting are essential to the accurate application of the INS attitude measurements to the determination of individual laser spot elevations. WFF anticipates the negotiation of a "performance based" contract for these services. All interested sources are encouraged to submit information that supports their ability to perform and  successfully complete the required services to NASA, Goddard Space  Flight Center (GSFC) , Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) , Attn: Andrew S. Dennis, Code 210.W, Wallops Island, VA 23337, telephone 757-824-1066, fax 757-824-1974, E-Mail address: Andrew.S.Dennis@nasa.gov, within 17 days from the date of  this publication. This sources sought synopsis is provided to assure inclusion of interested firms on the eventual solicitation source list and should not be seen as a formal solicitation document from which a contract will be awarded. A formal synopsis of this procurement will be published electronically and in the Commerce Business Daily, pursuant to FAR 5.2. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet -these documents will reside on the World-wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using client browsers, such as MOSAIC or NETSCAPE.

<DESC>The USAF Air Mobility Battlelab(AMB) plans to conduct a concept demonstration for a commercial/government of-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) system or emerging lighting technology for KC-135 aircraft aeromedical evacuation(AE) patient illumination.  The KC-135 aircraft is commonly used today for USAF strategic AE missions.  Cargo compartment lighting on this aircraft is inadequate for efficient patient care by AE crewmembers (AECM).  Poor illumination, especially for litter patients, makes clinical assessment and treatment very difficult.  A portable, non-handheld light source capable of individual AE patient illumination by AECMs is required to ensure safe patient movement.  Large area flood lighting is not desired.  Individual lighting that eliminates or reduces the potential disturbance of other patients is desired.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The lighting system should provide full-spectrum light of adequate power capable of illuminating a 36-inch by 84-inch area to fully visualize a litter patient without interfering with patient care and also have the capability to illuminate a single seated patient without disturbing other patients seated around them.  The system should be small, lightweight and in kit form, allowing an individual AECM to carry it aboard the aircraft.  The light system would preferably be attached on litter stanchions and/or straps for litter patients.  Lighting for ambulatory patients seated in the cargo area would be attached on the seats and/or aircraft fuselage or would be a combination of attached lighting and lighting that can be carried by individual AECMs for illumination of ambulatory patients, possibly hung around the neck of the AECM or attached to their uniform.  The system must be easily attached/detached and will require no modification of aircraft structure.  OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: The KC-135 cargo compartment operating temperatures range from below freezing to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  System must be explosion-proof, resistant to vibration, and approved for in-flight use.  INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: Primary power source should be long-life battery power.  The capability for plug-in AC power as an alternate source and for battery charging is desired.  The KC-135 has 115/200 volts AC, 400-hertz, three-phase electrical power.  Initiatives are under way to provide a 60-hertz power source aboard the KC-135, so compatibility with that source is also desired.  Lighting that is compatible with night vision goggles is not required but is desirable.  This lighting system is required for the KC-135 aircraft but would ideally be usable on all Mobility Air Forces aircraft such as the C-5, C-17, C-130, C-141, and KC-10.  Through this BAA the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies which meet the requirements, previously stated, for use in a Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding will be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 11 February 2003.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Please use the following guidelines when submitting white papers: a) TECHNICAL APPROACH.  Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed lighting system (no more than 1-2 pages).  Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system.  If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged (soft copies preferred).  b) RISKS.  Briefly address all potential risks.  Does the system rely on the performance of subcontractors?  c) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  Describe the type of training that will be required to operate your system?  How long will the training take?  Briefly summarize how personnel would deploy and operate the system.  d) COMPATIBILITY. Explain system compatibility.  Are there limitations?  e) ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING.  State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system.  What are the temperature and humidity limits within which the system will function properly?  f) COST.  What is the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers?  g) AVAILABILITY.  Provide system availability information.  Is it available off-the-shelf right now?  If not, how soon can it be made available?  h) PREVIOUS WORK.  Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this BAA addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work).  Refer technical questions and submit product information to: Mr. Tim Dabbs of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at dabbst@ctc.com or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Dabbs.  You may contact Mr. Dabbs with any questions you may have at (814) 269-2627.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.

<DESC>This is a request for information only. It is not a request for proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this request for information. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed standardized and, in some cases, validated serologic, microbiologic and molecular methods for laboratory identification and subtyping of Brucella and Burkholderia spp. (agents causing brucellosis, melioidosis and glanders).  A collection of representative isolates were selected from over 1000 available strains to provide temporal, geographical, source and genetic diversity, and were used to validate all methods.  Efforts are currently focused on modification and/or development and further validation of serologic methods to detect human immune response to these agents. Presently available methods, such as indirect haemagglutination test (IHA), microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and serum based - ELISAs-, as well as several commercially available screening tests, do not provide diagnostically relevant levels of sensitivity and specificity. Some of the problematic areas in the assays that already exist are the lack of assay standardization, validation, and variations in antigen preparation and quality control, resulting in different levels of purity, and absence of an appropriate and validated standard human reference sera and quality control sera.

CDC is seeking partners for a potential collaborative research project that would result in identification of conserved immunogenic antigens that induce immune responses that correlate with protection, and then modification and/or development and validation of sensitive and specific serologic assays based on these antigens. This would include standardization of the assays, standardization of the antigen preparation, development of reference reagents including new national reference sera for the respective assay validations, and finally,  transfer of the technology to public health laboratories.  A sufficient number of positive and negative sera will be needed so that there will be no ambiguity with determining the sensitivity and specificity of the assays.

The CDC goal is to establish and maintain serologic assays and associated reagents for detection of immune response to Brucella and Burkholderia spp., that would be widely available, and effectively utilized in clinical laboratories and State and local Public Health Laboratories. 

Interested organizations are encouraged to submit information that would be sufficient to assess the organizations ability to pursue research in the above area. Standard capability statements and marketing information is not desired. Submitted information should focus on previous experience and current capabilities in the relevant areas. Only those organizations with a strong background and experience in developing immunologic assays should respond.  It is intended that CDC will review the submitted information to assess the possibility of pursuing a collaborative or cooperative research and development agreement. Responses should be prepared in MS Word format, not exceeding ten pages in length. Electronic responses via e-mail can be sent to MMD4@CDC.GOV by 4:00pm eastern time, February 28th, 2003.  Questions regarding this request for information can be directed to Michael Detmer at the above e-mail address or by calling 404 639-0714.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-03-R-KK02, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular  FAC 01-11 and DFARS Change Notice 20021220. This is a full and open competitive procurement.  The associated NAICS code is 334510  and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system.  This system must readily integrate into currently owned NRL instrumentation.  This system will consist of a Femtosecond Laser, Time Correlated Single Photon Counting Electronics, Dual Video and Light Source Adaptors, Dual Source Light Guide with an Automated Switch, a Vibration Isolation and Optical Platform, and a Filtered Airlock Enclosure.  The focus of this procurement is the Femtosecond Laser.  All of the other components will be procured separately.

The Femtosecond Laser must meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:
1. The laser must emit pulses with widths less than 200 femtoseconds, have a pulse repetition rate of greater than or equal to 76 MHz, a tuning range from 700 nm to 980 nm.  2. The laser must have second and third harmonic generation capabilities allowing for the additional wavelength windows of 350 to 500 nm and 240 to 320nm, respectively. The peak second and third harmonic conversion efficiencies for a pump laser power of 8 Watts must be at least 8 percent and 4 percent respectively.  3. The laser must provide a means for being passively modelocked and for preferential control between continuous wave and modelocked operation. 4. The system shall include a starter mechanism which actively and reproducibly initiates modelocked operation. This system shall include a sensor to automatically restart the system should modelocked operation be interrupted.
5.  The laser shall have an internal diagnostic system which includes:  (1) an autoranging five decade fluorescence detector/power meter to facilitate alignment and optimization, (2) a monitor to verify continuous wave spectral content to insure spectral integrity of output and maintain pure modelocked operation, and (3) a biased, fast photodiode to provide a synchronization signal for detector triggering.
6.  The system should have internal pump laser steering optics for maximum control of the pump beam position into the Ti:Sapphire crystal.  These mounts should provide independent translational and rotational positioning of the Ar pump beam.  7. The system must be able to be pumped from the side of the laser so that no turning mirror is required outside the laser itself to direct the Ar beam into the cavity.  This configuration also allows the laser to be positioned at the corner of an optical table for optimum control and conservation of space.  8.	The laser must include a thoroughly tested interface kit for the Carl Zeiss, Inc. Axiovert 200 Microscope. 9. The pump laser must be single frequency (less than 5 MHz over 50 msec).  The laser must be specified with noise less than 0.02% rms from 10Hz to 1GHz. 10. There must be adjustment on the power supply to vary the output power of the rated output.  11. The diode bars which pump the Vanadate crystal shall contain no aluminum in the active area. 12. The laser must have a thermally-compensated resonator so that the system automatically and passively offsets the effects of thermal fluctuations in the laboratory that cause drift over long periods of operation. A two-dimensional laser cavity is preferred for reasons of simplicity in alignment and safety issues.  
13. Replacement of the diode packs housed in the power supply should be connected to the optical fibers via an SMA type connector for convenience.  When changing the diode bars, it should not be necessary to feed the fiber in and out of the umbilical cord.  14.  The pump diode laser head must be hermetically sealed so that no dust can enter the cavity and so that no alignment or cleaning of optics is needed.
15.  The contractor shall offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.  These warranty terms must be included in the system price.  The period of the warranty shall begin upon acceptance. 16. The laser must be installed by trained technicians in cooperation with Carl   Zeiss, Inc installation personnel. One day of on-site training for three Naval Research Laboratory employees in the general operation of the laser is required. 17.  A full set of all written 
ocumentation customarily provided to the public with a commercial item shall be provided.  This shall include users manual(s) or equivalent as well as copies of any software, and any manuals for the software included with the system, if customarily provided.  This documentation must be received at NRL with the system hardware, unless other arrangements are agreed to by the NRL representative.  Delivery and acceptance is at NRL, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, D.C.  20375, FOB Destination.  Delivery shall be no later than 120 days from date of award.
